Title: does not cool
Content:
paid over $200 for newair AF-350 evaporative cooler.  got it a week or so before our july heat wave, so I did not start using it right away.
when I did start using it, it did not blow cold air when I put unit on "cool".  Read owner's instructions and said I may need to put in a teaspoon of dishwater soap or fabric softner for the wick to start absorbing water.
I did this just this past Friday with the dishwater soap and it started working like a champ for that evening and part of saturday.  Then it stopped 
spewing cold air.  added another teaspoon of dish soap, no luck.  Took out all filters, wick is very wet.  Emptied unit, refilled with some dish soap, still no luck.
contacted newair company, they have not tech support, so I need to fill out a return form (wonder how much that is going to cost me) for a replacement unit. 
as just a plain fan, it puts out alot of air.
Don't but this unit.

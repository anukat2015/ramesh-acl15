Title: At last, the perfect home coffee-maker
Content:
The new Bunn coffee-maker is FAST.  Load coffee in the paper filter, pour in some water, slide the cover closed, and three minutes later you're drinking good, fresh coffee.  Three minutes, start to finish.  If you're like me, when you want coffee in the morning, you want it NOW.
With the Bunn, you've got it.  And it's better coffee than you're used to, because the Bunn uses hotter water that extracts flavor from the bean more efficiently.  As an added bonus, the burner doesn't shut itself off, so you can keep leftover coffee hot for days, if you're fond of that burnt coffee taste usually only found in the greasiest of greasy spoons.
Try the Bunn - you'll never believe Joe Dimaggio again.

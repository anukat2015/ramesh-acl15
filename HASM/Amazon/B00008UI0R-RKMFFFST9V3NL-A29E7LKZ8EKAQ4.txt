Title: No stamina
Content:
Vacuum is great at first but does not last a year without something breaking.  Hose splits - taped now - and handle comes apart.  Not impressive design.  You pay for the light weight with a lack of reliability.  Nice price tho - I paid a lot more at Costco but can return it forever ;}

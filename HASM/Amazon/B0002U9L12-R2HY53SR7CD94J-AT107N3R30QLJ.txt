Title: Mr. Coffee Thermal makes good coffee
Content:
Bought this pot after extensive online and in-store research.  My husband and I wanted an 8 cup coffeemaker so we could each have 2 cups in the morning and not waste any.  We're very happy with this purchase.  Price was right, shipping was free and it makes good coffee in a short time!  We scald the pot before making coffee and it stays hot a good long time with no nasty burnt taste.
Easy to use and easy to clean - we'll be taking this one in our RV on a long cross-country trip next Spring.  Only negative is that it seems a little big for an 8 cup but that's just me being picky.  Highly recommend this one.

Title: Great on my berber carpet for 3 dogs and a long haired cat!
Content:
We live in what they call the sticks!!  And so A LOT of dirt and junk gets dragged in on the bottom of shoes when they walk in from outside.  I also have 3 dogs that shed A LOT and a long haired cat.. So when my dirt devil clogged AGAIN for the last time, I bought this baby and was amazed! I loved the fact that all of the fixed vacuum tubes are transluscent so that you can SEE if there's a clog in there (which it never did anyway!) I was amazed at how much fine dirt and animal hair this thing picked up!  I have a fully berber carpetted 3 bedroom house and it was hard to find a vacuum that would work for that kind of carpet.  Not only did it pick up the usual stuff but it picked up so much fine dust that I didn't even know was in my carpet!  Great product!! It does require a little assembly and the instructions did leave a little to the imagination, but it was up and running in about 10 minutes.  Great product for not too much money!!  My mom has a Dyson and I borrowed it once and I would compare this with hers!!  Sorry mom!  You wasted your money!

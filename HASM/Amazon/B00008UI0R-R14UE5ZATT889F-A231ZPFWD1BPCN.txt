Title: Why buy a Dyson?
Content:
We used to have a Dyson upright for about 3 years and then it gave out - poor suction.  This time we decided to get a bagless canister model because the upright was a pain on stairs, and we live in a 3 story condo.  We looked at Dyson again, but spending over $500 on a vacuum was a stretch, especially on one that wasn't going to last a decade or so.  In my research I came across this WindTunnel, and it appeared to have everything the Dyson had, and several other features the Dyson didn't, such as an extra pet brush, lights, etc.  And since it cost $209 on Amazon, that sealed it for me.  
I have to say that even if the price was equal for the two bagless canisters, I still think that the Windtunnel wins out, but considering that you can get two and a half WindTunnels for the price of the Dyson, the choice is very easy.

Title: Great for amateurs!
Content:
We bought our Rebel after seeing the output from a relative's Rebel.  This is so much better than the smaller cameras, even with the higher MPs. The depth is great, as is the ability to move from auto to settings.  For the amateus such as myself, it's a great introduction.  Yet, a wedding photographer was using the same camera with different lense.  I appreciate our relative's recommendation, and would most certainly recommend to others.

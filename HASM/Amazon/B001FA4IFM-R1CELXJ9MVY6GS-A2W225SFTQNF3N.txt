Title: Great little heater, quiet
Content:
This small, lightweight heater puts out a lot of heat and is very quiet. The auto shutoff is effective, turning off at the slightest imbalance. We also have a tall Pelonis tower ceramic heater (HC-0130) that puts out less heat (though adequate for our purposes), takes up a lot more vertical space and is much noisier.  The Pelonis has better controls: a digital display shows actual room temperature in either C or F, has Low or High output options, oscillates (which we don't use), and you can preset a shutoff temperature in specific degrees. The heat controls on this Holmes is more basic, with Low or High output settings and only five temperature selections in 5-degree increments. You can set it to stay on continuously or set it to shut off when it reaches one of the five temperature options. Getting it to just the right combination of settings you desire can be inconvenient, as you must press the one control button as many times as it takes to get to that setting. Although the Holmes doesn't give you precision settings, it works so well and is so quiet, we wish we had bought another instead of the Pelonis.

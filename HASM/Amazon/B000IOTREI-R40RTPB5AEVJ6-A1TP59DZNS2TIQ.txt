Title: Current model not as good as previous ones
Content:
I bought one of these a few days ago at Costco without paying attention to detail, assuming it would be just like the one I purchased several years ago (and which still works great!).  The two big safety improvements may make the lawyers happy, but one is just silly (the nightlight), and the other renders the unit considerably less useful than my older one, in that the forward/back tilt is no longer adjustable, and the degree of back tilt is such that unless the unit is right at your feet (too close for me) it shoots the heat over my head.
If the lack of tilt won't be an issue for you, then this is a good heater for its style.

Title: No negatives from this coffee addict
Content:
I was in the market for a coffee maker to replace my old, awful Mr. Coffee machine, read all the reviews here on Amazon, and decided to give this Cuisinart a try.
Very glad I did.  This is a terrific little machine.  If you buy it, read all the instructions, including running clean water through it first before you brew any coffee.  I grind my own coffee beans to the medium-fine Cuisinart recommends.  Love the water filter that's included.  Love that the pot doesn't leak coffee when I pour a cup (which other brands of coffee makers that I've owned, especially Mr. Coffee, seem to do--I've owned a few--and some other brands of makers do).  Love that it has a "clean" indicator.  Love the taste of the nice hot coffee it makes.  I don't feel the machine has design flaws at all.  I do leave the filter in the machine when filling with ground coffee.
Great coffee maker for the price.

Title: Good service, bad product
Content:
I ordered this product, and it was defective.  The company sent me a replacement.  The replacement worked for about five uses, then it quit working.  I decided to dissect it rather than try again.  
Sure enough, it contains a heating element wire inside the metal casing that is about the thickness of a strand of sewing thread. Too fragile.  No wonder it failed after such a short time.

Title: Nice but bright!
Content:
This machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well. The fan is very quiet. I like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well. My only complaint is that the blue LCD that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is VERY bright. Too bright for a bedroom. Really lights it up. I'll be looking for some way of safely masking it. Otherwise very nice but hope it lasts.
OCTOBER 08' UPDATE:
2 California coastal winters (mild and short) and it's dead. Well not dead, but working erratically (noisy, not shutting off when the room reaches the Auto shut off temp, ...) No longer safe or usable.
For the bright light, I masked it with electrical tape. Safe and effective.

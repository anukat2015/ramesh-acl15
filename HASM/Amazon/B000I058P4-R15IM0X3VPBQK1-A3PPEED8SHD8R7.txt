Title: Thermal Carafe that works great!
Content:
I love this coffee maker.  I live in a country in Africa where electricity is not always on.  I wanted a thermal carafe so that if it is on and I happen to be awake between 4-5am, then I can turn the coffee maker on and go back to bed.  This way I have hot coffee when we get up at 6:30 even if there is not electricity (this is a regularly occuring scenario).  This coffee maker is perfect!  I didn't want to pay a high price as electronics don't last too long here, so the price was a good one. 
A few reviews complained that it leaks.  Well, there is a hole in the back of the water tank, so if you put more than 8 cups in, the water goes out of the hole.  That is pretty obvious.  
My only complaint about the coffee maker is where the water level chart is.  It is on the right side, which makes it difficult to watch while filling the tank if you are right handed.  A level on the front or on both sides would be helpful.
Other than that, it is easy to clean, keeps coffee hot for hours, and very easy to use.  For the price, it is a great buy!

Title: Irritating mechanical design flaw
Content:
The new iPod Nano is an impressive little device --- excellent playback, light weight, balanced, and has a few fun features like Genius that previous generations lacked.  But here's my beef: I cannot charge my Nano and play music at the same time in my car.  Why, you ask?  The head of the 1/8" phono plug that connects to my head unit is greater than 1/4" diameter and will not fit into the base of the Nano when the iPod docking cable is inserted. I've got to find an adapter or rewire my car a bit. Why would Apple put the phono receptacle on the BOTTOM of the Nano anyway? There seems to be plenty of room on top.

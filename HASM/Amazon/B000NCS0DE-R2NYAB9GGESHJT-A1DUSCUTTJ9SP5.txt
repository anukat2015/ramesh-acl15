Title: This thing sucks!
Content:
Literally, this thing sucks: dirt, pet hair, whatever!  I was quite amazed at its sucking power.  The rotating brush attachment is a wonderful thing.  Instead of the usual type of bristles, it has rubber 'fingers' that make picking up hair a breeze.  The filter is easy to access.  I clean it every time I use it, but that just shows me how much crap it is picking up.
A must buy!

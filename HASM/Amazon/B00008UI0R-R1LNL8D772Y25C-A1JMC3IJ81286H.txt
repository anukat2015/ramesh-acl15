Title: Vacuum worked well for a short time.
Content:
I have never had much success with Hoover products, but I bought this vacuum in January 2007 based on the excellent reviews it received here. It worked very well at first, picking up all the hair shed by my three cats. Over time it began to lose suction. Today when I tried to use it there was no suction at all and it started to smell like smoke. I have taken proper care of it, using it, changing the belt and keeping the filter clean all according to instructions. I don't know whether the loss of suction after less than three years is part of planned obsolescence (sp?)by the manufacturer, but I should think that a $350 vacuum cleaner would last longer than that. Until I saw the recent tv ads for another brand of vacuum, I didn't know that it's not unusual for them to lose suction. And while looking for a new vacuum (not a Hoover) I saw that a reviewer mentioned that, like my Hoover, his Bissell began to smoke and lose suction. I have no idea which vacuum I'm going to buy - but I will never buy another Hoover product.

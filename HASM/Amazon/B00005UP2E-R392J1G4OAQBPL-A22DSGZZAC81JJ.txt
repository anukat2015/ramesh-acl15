Title: Short term performance - excellent
Content:
I have only had this vacuum for several weeks.  In that time it has performed very well.  It has power for removing cat hair from area rugs, does not scratch my wood floors and empties easily. 
So far, I would buy it again and recommend its purchase, I'm very satisfied...

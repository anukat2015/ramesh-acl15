Content:
We ordered this item to supplement our condominium's radiant heating system on cold days when the radiant takes a while to become effective. It performs this function perfectly. Its light weight and convenient recessed "handle" allow it to be moved effortlessly from room to room, so it follows us from kitchen to living room in the morning. It is quiet and effective up to several feet away, the oscillating feature letting it cover a wide area. The lighted control panel is bright enough to be seen from several feet away, then goes dark in a few seconds after making a setting change with the remote control, so it's not shining all the time. Our condo is quite modern in design and furnishings, so the design of this heater fits right in. Also doesn't take up much floor space.

Title: Excellent vacuum!
Content:
I am extreamly pleased with this vacuum!  I have had an electrolux (canister) and a Beam built in Vac....So I wasn't sure what I was going to get with this Hoover, especially since it is a lot cheaper than my previous vac's.  I read so many good reviews about this one, so I thought I would give it a try ( I loved the design of it).  I love it.  It has very powerful suction!  And I was shocked at how much dust I emptied out when I was finished.  (I had read reviews that said the same thing, but thought "oh they are just dirty!")  But it really picks up dust and dirt you don't know you have!
The only thing I can not comment on is it's quality as far as how long it is going to last, seeing as I have only had it for 2 days.  But if it is a long lasting vac, I'll stick with Hoovers from now on. I hightly recomend this vacuum, it is great don't let the cheap price discourage you. Definately 5 stars.

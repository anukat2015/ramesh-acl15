Title: Look no further and buy this D40
Content:
I have several didgital cameras from Canon, Nikon and others.
This D40 is all anyone need.
Don't even bother with the newer D40X ... all you get to do is spend more money and don't get any VISIBLE results from the D40X. Resolution is not where you make a buying decison. This 6 gpixel camera will be almost an overkill for most people. If you never print larger than 8X10 and most people don't, then buy this one. However it can handle much larger prints as well, but most people use the images on webpages and alike. You can never see the max resolution on your computer display or a webpage.
The lens that comes with it is just fine. This is where the decision should be based. What good is to have 20 MPixels if you have a lousy lens and all you see is blurred images?
There is no need to get a different lens, unless you want 300 mm telephoto. Then be prepared to carry a large tripod all the time with you.
The macro is close enough and gives super clear images.
I would love to have a bit closer macro, but it's not a big thing. 
By far, this Nikon is (I also have film Nikons) the camera to take with you. It's not a PS camera and got some heft to it. 
One con:
The grip should have been a bit longer for the right hand. The bottom of that side is a bit sharp and eventually you'll find it uncomfortable for long periods of holding it. Minor issue and it should not take away from the functionallity of the camera.

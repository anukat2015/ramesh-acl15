Title: If you want to start SLR, this is it :)
Content:
I had other SLRs before, the starter machines I mean. Digital Rebel XT is the best one I had so far. It feels very professional, and it really takes very good pictures. The LCD screen is a bit smaller for my taste, but it doesn't justify the quality of the images I receive from the machine.
Buy it; if you are ready to jump in SLR world, before get yourself a crazy expensive machine :)

Title: Lousy repair policy for Sattelite Computers
Content:
My Toshiba Satellite blue screened on me and I was told by Toshiba that I could drop it off at a local authorized repair center.  I did this and was told it would take about three days.  Two days later the repair center called me and told me that Toshiba will not allow them to work on Satellite Computers and that they had to send the computer to Toshiba, I said okay.  Two days after that the repair center called again and told me that now Toshiba will not even allow them to send it back.  I will have to drive to the repair center pick up my defective computer call customer service and order a box.  It takes two, to three business days for the box to arrive, you then have to put the computer into the box and send it to Toshiba, where it will arrive in another two to three days, then you have to figure it will take another two or possibly more days for them to repair the computer and then another two to three business days for the computer to arrive at your doorstep.  So if you can go without your laptop for over a week then you will have no problem with Toshiba's new repair policy for its Satellite computers.

Title: More Than Enough Megapixels
Content:
If you're debating whether or not this D40 will have enough megapixels for you, it probably will. I was debating whether or not to spend more money on more megapixels, but realized that money would be better spent on some accessories like a camera bag, sb-400 flash, extra battery, and two 2gb memory cards. Unless you plan on making prints greater than 11x14 or so, this camera should have all the megapixels you need. In fact, it's probably the best digital SLR value on the market today! I've always been a Canon person, but so far I am very impressed with this Nikon.

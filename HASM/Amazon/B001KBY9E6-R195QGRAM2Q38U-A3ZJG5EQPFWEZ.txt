Title: Good starter machine
Content:
I received the Mr. Coffee Espresso/Cappuccino Maker as a gift. Obviously it's not going to produce the same results as some of the more expensive models but I think it works well enough for personal use. It's very simple to use-it only has two functions: brew or steam. 
I  noticed that several people commented about leaking and the instructions warn that this can occur if there are grounds around the top of the filter or if you over-fill the filter. The frothing arm is very short but I found a small frothing pitcher at World Market that works well. As far as worrying about aluminum in your espresso, the instructions also warn that you shouldn't leave water in the reservoir when you're not using the machine. The only other thing to remember is that you MUST de-pressurize the system before removing the filter holder or water reservoir cap!! To do this, unplug the machine, wait for it to cool off, then turn the knob to "steam" until you hear the hissing stop. 
I think that for the price, this machine produces a nice cup of espresso in a relatively short amount of time.

Title: love this hoover!!
Content:
I have been wanting a new vacuum cleaner for awhile, and I had always been disappointed with my uprights.  My mother had a cannister vac when I was young so I decided to get one.  As a physical therapist, i always have pts with back pain who have a hard time vacuuming.  I wanted one that would be easy to use and one that I could let my mom use, so she would not hurt after cleaning.  This vac has great suction and goes completely under all of my furniture.  i love the on/off switch..it is so easy to access, right on the handle.  You can adjust the suction as needed and anytime you want to use the extension wand, just press the lever with your foot and it detaches.  It is easy to transport, i disassemble and put it in my car.  It is so easy to clean.  I rinse the cannister and filter each time I use it and let it air dry...there is no lingering odor for the next time I use it.  The only bad points:  the cord could be a little longer and not all of the tools fit onboard.  But I can live with that and wouldn't trade anything for this great vac...great value for the money.  I researched for 2 weeks before making my decision..this one should last me for years and years!!

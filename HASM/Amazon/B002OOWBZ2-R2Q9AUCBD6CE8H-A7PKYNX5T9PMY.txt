Title: PERFECT LAPTOP FOR THE COLLEGE STUDENT!!!
Content:
I recently purchased this laptop for my college student daughter and she loves it. It is light in weight and extremely thin but yet appears to be very durable. It has all of the "bells and whistles" one could wish for except for an optical drive in which case one can easily purchase a portable optical drive. (I would recommend the Toshiba Portable Multi-Super Optical Drive.) For normal applications the battery will last for at least eight hours before it needs to be recharged! This is a real plus for college students who use their laptops during classes. My daughter found the touch pad a little awkward for her but the addition of an inexpensive usb retractable mouse works flawlessly. Some reviewers on other sites have complained that the sound was too low but that was because they did not realize that the volume is to be adjusted by going to the Control Panel and clicking on Smart Audio/Smart Eq. to make the needed adjustments. Apparently the manual does not point this out. With features such as Windows 7, a built in web cam., full size keyboard, plenty of speed and memory, long lasting battery, a HD 13.3 inch screen, and a memory card reader,  this surely makes the Toshiba T135-S1305 the perfect laptop for any college student!!!

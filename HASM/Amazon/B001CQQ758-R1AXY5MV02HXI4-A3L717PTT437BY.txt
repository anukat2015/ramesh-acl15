Title: New improved venting model
Content:
The DeLonghi TRV0715T is the new improved model of the long standing old premier model,the TRD0715T known as the 'Dragon,' This Vento 'V' model utilizes a better designed front fin design as well as increasing the total fin surface area to convey more heat into the surrounding air. The controls are highly intuitive and easy to use. No odors, no spills, no exposed heating elements, a quality build. Very safe and proper. A superior room heater that will last years.

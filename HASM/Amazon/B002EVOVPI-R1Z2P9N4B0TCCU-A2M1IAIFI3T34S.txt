Title: Do you like to drink mud?
Content:
I have been using Capresso coffeemakers for 10 years.  My first two were the kind where the filter basket swings back and forth - the 454 which is no longer made.  I loved these machines.  They each lasted 4 - 5 years.  When the more recent one started leaking all over the counter, I replaced it with this new 464.05.  Even though I have it set to the coarsest grind, it grinds the coffee so fine that the last two cups are undrinkable because of the amount of sediment - it is like mud.  Capresso Customer Service call number one resulted in them sending me replacement parts for the bottom of the filter basket.  This did not help, but the gentlemen was quite pleasant.  The second Customer Service call leaves me not wanting another Capresso coffeemaker ever - the woman was rude and just kept repeating herself over and over:  "using the the gold tone filter results in sediment".  Well ok, but if using this filter (that comes with the machine) results in undrinkable coffee, something is wrong with the machine.  Talk about leaving a bad taste in my mouth....

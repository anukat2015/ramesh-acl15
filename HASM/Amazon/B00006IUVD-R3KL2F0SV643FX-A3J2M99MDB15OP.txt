Title: Excellent single serve coffee maker
Content:
This is an excellent single cup coffee maker.  I had one for about 7 years before it finally died, and decided to try another brand for a replacement because it was cheaper.  I was not happy with the other brand, so I finally bought another Black and Decker and am very happy I did.  It has a permanent filer, although I use paper filters for cleaning convenience, and comes with a travel mug.  Mostly I use coffee pods though as they are the easiest, although the coffee can be a little weak with the pods.  All in all, I would recommend this produce.

My first digital SLR was the Canon D10. Great camera. I had it for roughly 5 years. Thought it might be old so I sold it on amazon to a fellow that I'm quite sure got a great deal. It didn't have a scratch on it. After I sold it, I felt like it was a mistake, as it was such a great camera. I kept my lenses. My brother has the Rebel XTi and told me to get it. I did. I like it better that the D10. Quicker start up. Quicker at pretty much everything. Great pictures, although to be honest, I cannot tell the difference between the two. I take only a few pictures per week, but use it alot on vacations. Just a beginner at best. We use my wifes canon point and shoot around the house. The Rebel is smaller than the D10, this may be the only down side for a large hand. I would buy it again without reservation.

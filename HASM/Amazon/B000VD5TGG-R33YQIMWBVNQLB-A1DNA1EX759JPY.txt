Title: The old one was better, cheaper
Content:
There was a previous generation Bissell "big green" home cleaning unit. Bissell quit making it, but can still be found on the web. Amazon still sells some parts for it. The previous "big green" unit was manufactured for at least 15 years. It was simple, robust, and cleaned well. I suggest that you consider seeking one. This unit is disappointing and not worth the money.

Title: Favorite iPod
Content:
We have numerous iPod's in our family, the video iPod, mini, old shuffle among them.  While the big iPod is good as the main household music library and is used w/stereo and in the car on long trips, I got this to work out with since I didn't want to use a big armband w/the big iPod. And I have fallen in love with this little jewel.  It clips so easily to everything, weighs next to nothing so you don't even notice it's on.  Running with it is perfect. Doesn't get in the way if you happen to fall asleep with it on. It has great battery life and is almost indestructible. The clip has perfect grip, nice and firm but doesn't ruin clothing/fabric. Love using it for music and works great with audiobooks as well, since it book marks where you left off last. In fact, we got a second one so the kids could take it to camp, etc. cause it travels so well. Well made, functional & cool...it deserves some kind of design award. This is a great little addition to the family for those with bigger iPods.

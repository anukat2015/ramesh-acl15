Title: Worth the OLED
Content:
I would rate this player as an amazing experience...
The OLED screen is totally worth the cost !
Positives - 
1) Amazing Screen
2) Amazing sound
3) Complete customization option - i.e if you can design the UI on your own with your own theme etc (if you know flash)
4) Amazing battery life for videos - 8- 10 hours (in suggested resolution)
5) Extremely durable !
I think the few negatives that exist in this player "that affect me" are:
1) There is no on the go playlist option .
2) There are no accelerometer based games out yet (like the i touch)
3) The cover flow album art is laggy , UI in general is ok. (it keeps improving as people come up with better stuff).
4) It doesn't support x.264 
The biggest asset of this player, is its screen.. I am completely spellbound by its clarity, color and contrast..

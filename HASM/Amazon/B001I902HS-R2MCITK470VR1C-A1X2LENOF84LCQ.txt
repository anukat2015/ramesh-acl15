Title: good lightweight vac
Content:
I do like this vac, I have used uprights for years because they have better suction. This one has good suction and will match many uprights. It worked very well on the carpets, it doesn't get into corners but neither do the uprights. The head and wand are very light weight compared to an upright and the head swivels so it is easy to go under some furniture. The canister part scoots across the floor easily and the only time I actually had to pick it up and carry it is if there was an area that was raised between rooms that it couldn't easily go over. 
I felt the cord was adequate, I was able to vacuum my entire downstairs with a single plug in, I did have to backtrack and go in another direction but I didn't have to unplug.
The main reason I only gave it 4 stars is 
1. because of the positioning tab to change the height for the carpets is very flimsy looking and apt to break.
2. The bags seem to be hard to find, I did a search on amazon, a google search and a search on the panasonic website. The book says it takes C-18 bags, I searched for that and I also searched using the model number of the vac with no results.

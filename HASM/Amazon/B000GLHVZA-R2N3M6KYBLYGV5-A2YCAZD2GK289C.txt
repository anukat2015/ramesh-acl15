Title: average (*edit* lasted one year)
Content:
Pros:  Solid construction, safe around my cats (not likely to be knocked over, and little paws are safe), heating element not visible in a dark room, high/low setting, can be used as fan, heats up my room better than my cheaper (but reliable) holms heater.
Cons:  It doesn't feel anything like my car heater on max setting.
Noise. On the high setting it reminds me of a locast swarm a mile away- on the low setting it's even louder.  Durability: unknown.
I would give it five stars if half the price, but I don't think it's a great value for the money.
*edit* after one year the unit started having problems.  It will overheat within seconds of turning the unit on and shut itself off.  The work around is to run the fan first before turning up the heater control.  I believe that this is a problem with the power supply that is built into the unit not providing enough wattage to simultaneously start the fan and run the heater; if you start the fan first the problem is avoided (a fan draws more electricity when starting than once it's running).

Title: It Scratches your wooden floors!
Content:
This is a nice product except that it has scratched our wooden floors!
The wheels are made of hard plastic and they leave marks on wooden (or laminated wooden) floors. Very disappointing!!!! Would it be very costly to have softer wheels that would not damage the floor?

Title: Don't do it!!!!!!!!!
Content:
Wow,I was so excited to treat myself to a new vacuum. The belt DOES NOT stay on the motor. I took it to an authorized service center and he said it just needed a new screw put in......I don't think so. I didn't have it home 5 minutes and the belt came off again. Great vacuum if only the belt stayed on, that happens to be  a big problem. Don't do it you'll only be aggravated. Keep looking.......Betsy Steckel

Title: Horrible unit - do NOT buy!
Content:
this thing was a mess from the very beginning!
besides the unit being extremely heavy to move around, it takes HOURS to install!
one of the key features was a remote, WHICH WAS NEVER IN THE BOX! and i took the manufacturer almost a year (and 3-4 calls) to send us the missing remote control!
now, it's 2 months past the warranty period and the unite DIED!! it's making a buzzing noise, indicating that it's on, but does not start - switch into any modes (fan/cool/dehumid).
cust. support suggested a local repair shop, but they charge $80/visit and the replacement part will only  be paid for by them if it the part is under the "5 year sealed system warranty"
what a joke!
do not buy this unite!

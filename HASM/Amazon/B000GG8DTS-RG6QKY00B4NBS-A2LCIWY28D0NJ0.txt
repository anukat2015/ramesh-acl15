Title: Very Small Disc-Small Heat
Content:
I've owned a parabolic heater in the past. Holmes was the brand but they are not making them any longer.
This is just too small a heater to heat anything other than an enclosed area about 5'x5'. As in a cubicle.
It is also very lightweight, as in too lightweight, you knock it over if you just bump it with your foot, and since it's so small it's real easy not to see. I returned mine the day after I received it. Going to try the Quartz Radiant box type made by the same company, Optimus!

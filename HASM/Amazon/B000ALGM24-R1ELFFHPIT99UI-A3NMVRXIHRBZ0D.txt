Title: The weather is here...
Content:
'Tis the part of the year when temperatures here range between freezing and 85 degrees, sometimes during the same day.  It was a continuous hassle, turning on the heat or turning on the A/C, trying to keep the kids from having pneumonia or the chinchillas passing away from the heat.
My son and I installed this thermostat in about 20 minutes.  The directions are very comprehensive, and when it says read through them *before* installation, they are correct - RTFM!
As for the thermostat, it has performed well.  We set a range for it to stay within, and it does that without any problem.  Switches between A/C and heat as needed without our intervention.  A great feature is the Home button, which allows you to move to the warmest (heat) or coolest (A/C) setting on days when you are home (or are just too darned cold).  Otherwise, set it and forget it - no need for seasonal (or daily) adjustments.

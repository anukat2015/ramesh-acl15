Title: great coffee, difficult for my wife to fill
Content:
This coffee maker is excellent so long as one's shoulders are strong enough to raise the water container on top of the machine and to steady the container sufficiently to pour the water accurately into a relatively small water container when the unit is on the counter. For a macho male, no sweat.  Some, if not most women, will not be able to do this easily as they are not as tall and/or strong.  The timer-related electronics are easy to set up and use.  Very easy to fill and clean the coffee filter.  The unit is a bit on the large size so measure carefully if space is limited. The thermal feature is excellent! This feature probably explains the unit's weight.

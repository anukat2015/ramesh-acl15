Title: Very pleased!
Content:
I ordered this on a Tuesday and it was delivered on a Thursday in the SAME WEEK.  First - I was very pleased with how fast it was delivered.  Second - it was very easy to assemble by myself.  Third - it sucked up ALL of the dog hair in our house from our two 80 pound dogs that shed all over our house.  Fourth - it was very easy to push around and seemed light weight at times.  Much lighter than my older Bissell. I am very happy with this purchase and how powerful it is.

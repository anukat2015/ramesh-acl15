Title: 6 beautiful megapixels
Content:
No wonder reviewers have had so much good to say about this camera's image quality, it really is that good.  Obviously, I'm really impressed with this camera, but for good reason.  It's moderately priced, includes in-body shake reduction, and even better, really produces fantastics images.  I haven't tried to enlarge more than 8x10, but I suspect that with a little work on my part, this camera could do much larger sized prints.
 Despite the megapixel race in the DSLR market, leading to high end and higher end cameras that start at 10MP or up,  I think there's a place for nice, light, sturdy, compact and capable camera.  I personally can't tell the difference between 10MP and 6MP at 8x10 sizes, and I remember when the high end pro-level dslrs were running at 6MP(it wasn't that long ago).  Nikon and Pentax are the last of the companies offering nice 6MP entry level models, and it's kind of a shame.  When 6MP looks as good as it does when coming out of this camera, you don't worry about how many pixels, you just look at the prints and mutter "WOW!".

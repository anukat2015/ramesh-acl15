Title: Heat output just isn't that much
Content:
This heater works fine and is compact, but it just doesn't do the job heating.  I have it in a small room (10 X 12), and if I close it off and leave it on high for several hours, it will warm the room up some, but maybe only to about 67-68F according to the indoor thermometer I have on the wall.  It is warm right over it, but how much time do you spend over a heater in your home like you would over a campfire in the woods?  I will say it is quiet compared to a heater fan of course, so if you want to be cold and in peace and quiet, it will work.  I would say this is product is only for a small, enclosed space such as a bathroom or small bedroom that is closed off, well insulated and has no windows.

Title: fabulous small heater
Content:
I live in the country in a trailer and have a 8x8foot building containing my water reserve tank and softener. It's insulated but needs some heat in the winter. The previous one had high and low but it still kept it at 60%. It was wasting electricity. This has an additional very low setting to keep pipes from freezing. I expect to see a lower electric bill.

Title: Disapointed
Content:
I was disapointed, not with the apple iPod touch 32, but with Amazon who advertised the iPod as the newest model. The newest or latest model of the iPod touch 30GB touch is great however misrepresented. It does not have the bluetooth technology. The latest iPod touch beginning last fall had the bluuetooth feature. I was greatly disapointed with amazon for misrepresenting the item. I guess this will never be on the reviews since I was disapointed with Amazon but not apple.

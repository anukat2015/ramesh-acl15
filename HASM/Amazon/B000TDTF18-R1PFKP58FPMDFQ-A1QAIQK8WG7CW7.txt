Title: DESIGN FLAW, just Like Everyone Else-IT LEAKS
Content:
My wife have had this product for a few months and generally only use it when our in-laws come over or host parties, or weekends.  We got back from a weekend getaway, decided to make a pot of java, and sure enough, the coffee pot is leaking out that back as others on this review has prescribed to.  What a "POT" of junk and it sounds like it's not worth sending it back since 1) it's on the "customers" dime to do so and 2) the replacement Delonghi sends is just as big of piece as the first ones.  Sounds like it's time to do my part w.r.t reducing my carbon foot-print and go green by recycling this pathetic effort of a drip coffeemaker and share my thoughts with DeLonghi.

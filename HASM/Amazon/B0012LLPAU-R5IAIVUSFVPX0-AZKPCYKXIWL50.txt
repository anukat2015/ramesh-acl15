Title: Waste of money
Content:
Tried 2 different ComfortZone heaters.  Both were an absolute waste.  These heaters ran non-stop and drove our electric bill through the roof.  Neither did much to regulate or even affect the temperature in the rooms.  We have gone back to $25 oil-based heaters which work far better than these at several hundred dollars.  BTW, the manufacturer and retailer refused to honor a money-back guarantee within the promised time-frame.  These are simply another gimmick and cannot replace old technology.

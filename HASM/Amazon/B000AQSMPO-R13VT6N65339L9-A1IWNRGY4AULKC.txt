Title: The future of home brewing ...
Content:
The Keurig is the future of home brewing coffee!  Weve had the b60 for a year now, and we still get excited about the morning coffee. (throughout the day coffee since we got the Keurig)  If the .38 cent/cup
only saved us from cleaning the old coffee maker parts
every day, it would be well worth it, but since we always have about 10 flavors to choose from, and the taste is better than any drip machine could produce, the Keurig is a no brainer.  i think its just a matter
of time before everyone else realizes whats going on in the world of single cup coffee, before these machines will be on every counter in the land, and we'll be buying our k cups at the local supermarket ...

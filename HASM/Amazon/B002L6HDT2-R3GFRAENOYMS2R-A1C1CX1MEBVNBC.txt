Title: love it!
Content:
This new generation has so many more cool things... i love that it now has a FM radio on it.  It has a cool video recorder, but i could've done without it.  It has a bigger screen and looks pretty sweet.  I had an older nano that didnt haven anything flashy on it and i'm happy that this one even plays music out of it...  you dont need the headphones! itd a pretty sweet deal.  My other ipod players still work with it, but it says that its not compatible to charge the ipod... thats the only problem i had with it.  But oh well, i bought an $8 charger from amazon and it works like a charm.

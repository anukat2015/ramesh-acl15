Title: Very Misleading
Content:
I purchased an edenpure and was VERY disappointed.  The unit did not keep the room it was in warm.  Infact, I had to heat the room with my gas heat and then maintain with the edenpure.  Also beware because Edenpure Store does not stand behind its product.  Once you by it you own it for good.  I was 1 day over the 30day warranty and they would not even consider an exchange or refund.

Title: Hoover insists there is no known problem with the machine
Content:
The vacuum power is decent.  However, the cord stopped retracting after 3 uses, and the nozzle constantly separates from the long metal wand.  One moment the vacuuming is going well, and the next you are holding only the nozzle (with the hose attached) while the metal wand clunks as it falls to the floor.
Phoned Hoover.  They insist there is no known issue with this vacuum cleaner.

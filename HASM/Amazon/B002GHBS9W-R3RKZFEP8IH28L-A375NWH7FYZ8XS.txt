Title: Nice and hot coffee
Content:
It works great..my other coffeemaker didn't keep correct time, as a result, I never have coffee when I woke up. This works perfectly.
 I like the fact it takes either the reusable filter that's provided, or, paper filters with a flat bottom, which I prefer.
 The only thing that bugs me a little, when I open the lid, it kind of looks like Darth Vader.

Title: Great Buy
Content:
If you are looking to upgrade from form D40 save yourself $1000 vs the D300 and buy this D200 body for $799. You can't beat it and I tried. Camera stores won't even talk to you for this price and they tell you it's not a USA made product. Bull! This is the real deal. I love my D200. My buddy has the D300 and paid close to $2000. There is little difference.
This item was shipped new, not remanufactured in a sealed Nikon box with all the accessories. I continue to buy from Amazon. They are the best.

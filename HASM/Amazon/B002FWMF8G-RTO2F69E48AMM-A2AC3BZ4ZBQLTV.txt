Title: Cafe Frappe money saver
Content:
I bought my fiance the Cafe frappe maker for Xmas. She is a everyday coffee shop person who typically gets a grande blended drink from Starbucks, Dutch Brothers, or a Local coffee shop depending on whats on her way that day. We are both in agreement that we are making blended drinks we enjoy as much as if not more than the ones from the coffee places. The recipe book gives a good jumping off point and we're already experimenting with proportions to find the sweet spots with new ingredients. In a month or so this is quite literally going to pay for itself with us.

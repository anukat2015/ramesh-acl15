Title: Bought IHeater in the Spring
Content:
I generally agree with Robert "Bobbie" except that cost of operation.  In our Rural Electric CO-OP, cost is more than double larger areas.  Delayed reporting due to time of year begenning use.  In Fall/Winter (CO-OLD) weather. electricity is higher than gas.  In a comparable period, electricity increased about $70 and gas only $35.  While the unit does lessen the furnace operation and decreases the dryness of the air, it is more expensive to operate here,.  Question is, Which is more expensive in your area?   Good Luck, Berto

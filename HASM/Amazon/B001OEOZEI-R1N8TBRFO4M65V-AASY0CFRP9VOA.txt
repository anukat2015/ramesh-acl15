Title: Nice machine, but prefer the shiny screen
Content:
This computer is really the only choice if you need performance in a tablet/touch form-factor. The HP multi-touch software doesn't add much to it, however (I have been running it with Windows 7 and no manufacturer software) and it will be a while before there are meaningful mult-touch applications available (I use it myself for designing/prototyping future apps). My only complaint is that I borrowed this exact model from a coworker and have been using it while I wait for mine to arrive. When mine came, I found it has a very grainy, almost unviewable screen. I never selected an option for shiny/matte, so this is particularly frustrating. I understand why they would have changed it (as the shiny version attracts lots of greasy smudging), but after using both I much prefer the shiny screen to the new grainy one (the smudging was no where near as bad as the grainy film on the new one -- and I can always clean it if it bothers me).

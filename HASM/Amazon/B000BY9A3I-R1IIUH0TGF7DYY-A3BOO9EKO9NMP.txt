Title: Very Impressive First Impression
Content:
I bought this vaccum as a gift, and was so impressed I am going to buy one myself. Its solid and well engineered. On Christmas day I had a go at playing with it and as a guy who is not big on vacuuming, I love using this thing! Its got the coolest sliding throttle on the handle, as you slide it forward it increases the motors speed like a jet fighter getting ready for takeoff. Time will tell if it will last, but I see no reason why it shouldn't. My Mother, whom I bought it for, couldn't be happier. Thats good enough for me. : ) 
Shipping: I have heard horror stories of items like this arriving damaged, but I must say it arrived in perfect condition. Not even a dent or rip in the cardboard. It does ship in its original box, so be careful if giving it as a gift. 
ADDED 05/24/2008: Still going strong and Mom still loves it! This is one impressive vac! I plan to buy one myself.

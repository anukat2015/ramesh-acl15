Title: Perfect for my needs
Content:
OK, my plan was to buy a cheap laptop for travel and instal some version of Linux, so that's what I started out looking for. Obviously, I just couldn't bring myself to do that. I'm a MacHead from way back, so syncing with the desktop and application compatibility became an issue. I needed small and light, and this is definitely small and light. I needed rugged and this is rugged. But, the keyboard is absolutely wonderful. I'm not a trackpad fan, but I really like this one. Took about an hour to adapt to it, and now I wouldn't have anything else. The display is beautiful. On of the best I've ever seen with one minor exception. The glossy screen is less than ideal in some lighting conditions. By and large, I can adjust the tilt of the display and it's fine, but the reflections can be a bit much. OTOH, in decent lighting conditions it's gorgeous. I spent way more than I intended, but I'm using this machine much more than I intended also. It's seen every bit as much action as my desktop since it arrived. The original plan was to use it only for travel, since I really don't much like the laptop form factor. Except for this one.

Title: Only lasted 5 years
Content:
I thought I'd write a review today since I've had this model coffee maker now for almost five years.
Today it will be laid to rest.  It started having issues a couple of years ago with the lid and ended up cracking at the top. So it's had duct tape holding the lid together for two years.
A week ago we started having issues with it not working when turned on.  After unplugging it, taking things out and putting them back in, we'd finally get it to work.
Yesterday I got it to work, but when I poured my cup, it was only lukewarm and had to be heated in the microwave.
Today it's not even working any longer.  The light comes on, but apparently no one's at home.
It was a nice coffee pot and will be missed.
Stinks though that it only had a five year life. Now I must go out and get another coffee maker.

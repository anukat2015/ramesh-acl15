Title: Like sitting in front of a fireplace!
Content:
I love this heater.  We also have an oil-filled radiator type electric heater.  The Soleus is superior in every way.  The plug on the radiator heater gets hot after an hour or so of use but this one doesn't.  And it warms you the instant you turn it on.
My husband complains a little about the brightness but it doesn't bother me at all.

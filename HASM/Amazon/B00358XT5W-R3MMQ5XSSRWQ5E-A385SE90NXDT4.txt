Title: Great for the money!
Content:
I purchased the Acer AS5732z-4867 15.6 Inch Laptop for my daughter who is a college freshman.  It worked upon arrival and was easy to set up.  The screen size is great for college homework.  No problem running the Windows 7.  The computer is basically used for surfing the internet, typing papers, email, watching DVD's.  The picture is sharp.  A great laptop for the money.

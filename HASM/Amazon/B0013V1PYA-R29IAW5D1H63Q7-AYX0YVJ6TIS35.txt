Title: foot warmer mat
Content:
I actually purchased it to warm the house for my two dogs.  Their house is inside my garage, but it is unheated and gets cold here in michigan, so I wanted something to heat a little.  When I got the pad I tried it in my family room on the carpet to make sure it did not get too hot, and it got to about 130 deg.  It is a large house, kind of a duplex, with each dog having a seperate but adjacent area.  The frame is 2x4 so there is a 3 1/2 inch space below the house, and I put the pad in that space so it heats the floor of the house but the dogs can't get at it.  It works great.  When the outside temp was 30 I measured floor temp above the pad of 70.  The air inside the house is not hot, but noticable warmer.   The dogs love it.

Title: Sony VAIO VGN-AR760U/B
Content:
I Love the Sony VAIO VGN-AR760U/B I used to have a Dell Inspiron 6400 and I start to have problems when I played my games, so I decide to buy this computer after reading all the reviews, I choose one day shipping and the next day I have my new laptop, it came very well packaged don't have recovery disc but I don't think is important I have almos 2 years with my dell and never used the recovery programs, but I made my recovery disc after removing all the programs I didn't want. 
I turn on the Laptop and I noticed The screen is too bright to my eyes I have sensible eyes,  but when you are out in the sun is perfect, The only thing I don't like is that when I adjust the display brightness to lower a noise appear and I call the VAIO support but they told me that this is normal because of the good quality of the display so i will buy a privacy filter soon to not heard that noice and my eyes not suffer.  
The quality of the colors of the display are fantastic nothing compare with my Dell also is fast, fast very fast, I install all my games the Monopoly, Zuma Deluxe, Chuzzle Deluxe, Cradle Of Rome, Dairy Dash, Ranch Rush, Cake Mania2, Chocolatier 1 & 2,Cooking Academy, Hoyle Puzzle & Board Games, Solitaire City, Slingo Supree, Age of empires and all work great I liked to play lots of games, I transfer all my videos, Music and picture and I'm only used 177 GB so I still have lot of free space. 
I have a program to conver the format of my videos but with the VAIO Video and Photo Suite and with the "click to disc" option I don't need nothing more. I'm not use all the programs that this machine have already, but it will take some time to used them all.
I removed some installed programs that came and I don't need and of corse I remove the Norton 360 antivirus because I use it before with my Dell for a year and didn't liked because slows my computer a lot and if you need to do a sistem restore always meke problems it take a lot of time to installed and more time to uninstaled, so I install the ESET Smart Security is better and you don't even notice that is there and it's very secure. 
I bought the Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip Case for 17" Notebooks (Black/Blue) and it's perfect for this Laptop and nice looking, but you can only put the laptop and the AC adapter,  don't have to much space, so I bougth also the Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack is large very large and you can put lots of stuff there also the Neoprene slip case fits.
I higly recomend the Sony VAIO VGN-AR760U/B is great..!!!

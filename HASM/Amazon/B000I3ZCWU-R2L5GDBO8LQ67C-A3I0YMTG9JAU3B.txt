Title: Great buy and easy to use
Content:
I've had this camera for going on 4 months, and I absolutely love it. This is my first digital SLR camera, and I'm really pleased with it. The image quality is really sharp, and it's very easy to use. I happen to have a background in photography, so it may be a bit easier for me than it is for a complete novice. However, I find the controls to be very convenient, and I lovve the resolution and size of the LCD display on the back of the camera.
I've read that the camera is a bit harder to handle for people with larger hands, but I don't have that problem. It's relatively lightweight and easy to handle.

Title: Decent Heater
Content:
Got this heater about 3 months ago to use under my desk at work to keep my feet warm (there's a bad draft along the floor in my office). It does sometimes turn off at inconvenient times and I have to fiddle with the settings/dials to get it to kick back on again. Then at other times it's down-right HOT and I have to cut it off. There's really no significant correlation between the air temp and when it goes off and on. It's very finicky. Anyway, for the money and that it's safe, it's a decent heater and does the job about 75% of the time.

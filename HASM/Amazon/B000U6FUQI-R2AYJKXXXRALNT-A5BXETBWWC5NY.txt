Title: An awesome product!
Content:
I was very hesitant about buying this product with so many mixed reviews, but took a chance and I'm so glad!  This vacuum cleaner is awesome!  I bought it for the sole purpose of a quick cleaning on our hardwood floors during the week, especially in the kitchen after cooking.  In now way should this be a replacement for your heavy duty vacuum cleaner!  It glides easily, is light-weight, and despite some of the reviews, it has great suction!  With it's modern look, you can't go wrong!

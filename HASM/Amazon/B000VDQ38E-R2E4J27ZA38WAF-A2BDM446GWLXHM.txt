Title: Best Vacuum I've ever owned...
Content:
This is coming from a guy who has never owned a vacuum that cost more than $30.  This Vacuum is awesome.  I was excited to vacuum my floors because all the other reviews I read were from people astonished by how much dirt it picked up.  I was also astonished and disgusted.  How could we have been living like this.  I did 2 rooms and 1 dining room rug on floors that looked clean from where I stand.  I got almost a whole plastic grocery bag full of pet hair, loose carpet fibers, dirt, dust, skin - God only knows what else.
I'm so amazed and feel so much better about the cleanliness of the carpets that I might roll around on the floor with my wife this evening.
Hands down, the most impressive vacuum experience I've ever had.  This beat the Rainbow demonstration we had last Fall.  A hundred and fifty bucks - just buy it.  And toss that old vac you got at Target when you were 20 years old - that thing stinks up the room when you run it.  The Bissell - no smell.

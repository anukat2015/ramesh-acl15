Title: After one year, I still LOVE this coffeemaker!
Content:
No more broken glass carafes. No more endless coffee drips and spills on the countertop from poorly designed carafes. The Cuisinart DCC-2000 is a wonderful coffeemaker -- solidly built and performs perfectly. The coffee is kept deliciously hot without ever developing the bitter burnt edge that you get from a traditional coffeemaker's warming plate. It automatically shuts off after two hours, which means that I never worry about whether I turned off the coffeemaker when I'm already 20 minutes away from home. As far as filling the reservoir, I'm lucky to have a spray attachment at my sink with quite a long hose... I can stretch it right over to the Cuisinart and fill it with water hassle-free. If I didn't have the sprayer, I wouldn't have a problem using any oversized tumbler or measuring cup to fill the reservoir... this coffeemaker is so worth the tiniest extra effort. It's easy to clean, I love the beep that tells me my caffeine fix is brewed and ready, and I get a kick out of the java-o-dometer that lets me know if I need to consider making a second pot (we're big coffee drinkers in this house). I very highly recommend this unit.

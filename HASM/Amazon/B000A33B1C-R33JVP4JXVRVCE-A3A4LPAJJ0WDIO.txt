Title: Decent heater
Content:
I used this in my garage over the winter with decent results, but have a few minor nits to pick with it. Given its heat ranges of 700, 800 and 1500, it has 2 almost identical heating elements, so it really only has 2 heating ranges. If they had used a 500w and 1000w element then they could have truely had 3 ranges.
Aside from that I am quite happy with it, I use it on the timer for a few hours in the morning and evening while I might be out there working on projects, and it kept my 2 car garage from ever dropping below 57F even when it was as low as 10F outside. Typically it was 65F. The garage is in a raised ranch, has insulated exterior walls, 3 windows with single glazing, and a feeble attempt at insulating the doors.
The smell that some folks complained about popped up at full heat, but as it was in the garage, the room was not as well sealed as the house so it was not too bad, and after a 20 hours of operation was no longer noticable.

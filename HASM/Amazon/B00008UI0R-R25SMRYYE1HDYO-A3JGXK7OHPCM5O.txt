Title: Hoover Widntunnel Vacuum
Content:
its a neat little vacuum cleaner, it has great suction,good for a 5 pet household, but with powerbrush on high its very hard to pull
the controls are to high up on the handle, It keeps cutting the power down as I move forward and back.the hose connection does not swivel.

Title: nice but not up to par for ipod
Content:
This is my first ipod brand mp3 player, we have had creative zen, microsoft zen, disney mix stix and some others in the house.  But I went for a nano for mine!  The rest of the family went non ipod versions of mp3 players.  I made a mistake!  I can use the ipod really well with my computer and with external speakers but to listen to it with earbuds is a total waste.  The headbud jack is a total waste if you push it all the way in you only get sound from one earbud and if you pull it out a little you can get sound from both but if you move it boes back to one ear lony.  Hoe on earth does ipod expect you to move around let alone excercise if you are always having to jiggle the speaker connection to make it work right.  Don't be a fool like I was and expect great quality from ipod, go for a microsoft zune or a creative zen before you get fooled by nano.
Apple replaced my nano with a new one and it is a little better, the sound quality is better, now you hear really good in one ear bud and pretty good in the other ear bud.  I bought some skull candy full metal jacket 11mm earbuds and they help alot.  Now the sound is even closer to the same, it is anoying ot have to  spend extra on something that should work right in the first place.  I still have the problem if you move the plug at all the sound totally cuts in and out, the plug should be able to plug in all he way ans work!  
Really If I did it over again I would go with a Zone or a Zen.

Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This little machine really sucks it up! Wow! Much quieter than our old machine, too. The only thing to remember is to watch the fill bucket. It will overflow and make a mess if overfull. I recommend buying one additional air filter so you can vacuum the dirty one with the new one in place. Just rotate them. We vacuumed with our old machine then ran this machine over the same room. The WindTunnel picked up and filled the bucket, twice. Unbelievable. If you are looking for clean this is the ticket.

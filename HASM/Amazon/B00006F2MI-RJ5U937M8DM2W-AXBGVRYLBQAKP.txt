Title: Cuisinart Grind and Brew
Content:
This is an excellent coffee maker. I read the reviews about the chore of cleaning and DRYING these grinding models. My goodness, this is not rocket science, you just run the two grinder parts under the water stream from your faucet and wipe them dry with a paper towel, it is no big deal. Makes a great cup of coffee and it stays hot for hours in the carafe. Highly recommended.

Title: watch out
Content:
We bought the PH4-13R-01 about a year ago.  We used it for about 4 months in the summer and had a few instances where it blew the circuit breaker but no other problems.  We didn't use it in the winter.  This summer it didn't work.  It wouldn't turn on.  I looked in one of the vents and saw a lot of broker pieces.  The problem was the plastic turbine blower had shattered.
Now I am trying to find a replacement part but I don't believe they sell them.  Also I found an article about a recall for their space heater sold on QVC because the poor quality of the parts used created a fire hazard.  I believe my broken blower is one of their poor quality parts

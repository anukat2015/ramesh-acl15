Title: quiet warmth
Content:
bought this heater for my elderly mother who is "always cold."  this product definitely delivers.  only problems are 1) the electric bill has doubled and 2) need to disconnect the heater before turning on one in another room, as it sometimes trips the circuit breaker.  these inconveniences do not take away from the fact that my mom is now toasty warm -- we keep the thermostat at "3" and use only the minimum setting.  Very good!

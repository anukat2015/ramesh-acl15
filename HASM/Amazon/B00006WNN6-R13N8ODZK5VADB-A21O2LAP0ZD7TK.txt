Title: Next to useless
Content:
Well, here are my problems with this unit:
1) It barely works. I use it in a 12x14 foot bedroom. There are two settings, 1500 watts and 750 watts, and you have to have it on 1500 before it warms the room at all.  At 750, I can put my freezing hands in front of it and the air coming out of it feels slightly above lukewarm. If I leave it on for a half hour, it raises a closed 60 degree room to 62. This has to be the most inefficient space heater on earth to produce such little heat with 750 watts of power. Literally every other ceramic heater ever made is better. You'll spend much more on electricity over time than you save on the heater. There are much better heaters out there, please buy a different one instead - ANY one. You can't possibly do any worse.
2) There's no off switch!!! I couldn't believe this until I read the manual, and sure enough - if you want to turn it off you have to unplug it. Ridiculous!
3) It's ugly as sin - it looks like some kind of avant garde sliced egg.

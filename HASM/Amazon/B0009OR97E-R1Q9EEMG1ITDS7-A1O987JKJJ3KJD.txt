Title: Simple, stainless steel body, reliable, and made in Sufferin, New York!
Content:
This canister vacuum is without doubt the most reliable and sturdy vac. made today.  My wife and I have had it with purchasing Chinese made 100% plastic vacuums and throwing them away every year due to breakage!  This vacuum is of an old reliable design and will most likely last us for decades.  It is no more expensive than our Electrolux we just threw away because 100% of it was plastic.  Even the plastic wheel broke off, along with the plastic attachments, brittle plastic which held the agitating roller, and the plastic nozzles.

Title: 2 years and it's still going strong.
Content:
I found this at a local targeting store two years ago, and so far it's been working just fine. This heater looks just like the 751320 model, but the main difference with this model is it has full control over the thermostat and an 8 hour timer. It heats a 12x12 room easily and is very quiet while doing so. What I like most about this heater is that the fan adjusts itself based on the heat level. Set it to hi heat, the fan runs fast. Set it to low, the fan slows down making it even quieter. Not too many heaters can do that.
Few cons: Can't use auto setting with low heat and no tip over protection. A lot of ceramic heaters don't have tip over for some reason. When you first turn it on, it blows out a gust of cool air because the element has a 1 second delay.

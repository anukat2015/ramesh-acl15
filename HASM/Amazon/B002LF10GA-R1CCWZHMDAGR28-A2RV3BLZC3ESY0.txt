Title: Good PC and a Good Value
Content:
After my son and I good a fair amount of research, I decided on the Acer 1410.  I've had it about a month and use it almost every day.  I was using a older machine with a larger screen, but have gotten used to the smaller screen, and have no concerns with it.  I like the full size keyboard, reducing the fat-fingering when I type.  I sometimes brush the touchpad and move the curser to an unwanted area, a little annoying if you don't catch it right away, and over-type your text.  Getting along without a drive system hasn't been a problem so far, I downloaded a printer driver from the printer website and am able to print remotely.  The battery lasts long enough for me, about 4+ hours with the Internet connection always on.  Unit is small enough to be very portable, light and easy to use on a desk, in a chair, on a lap, even lying in bed.  The chipset seems fast enough as well, claiming to be faster than the Adam processor in most mini's.  I do get some flicker when I watch HULU but it's not really a concern, I didn't buy it for that.  I've heard using Google Chrome helps this.  The unit comes with some trial softwar, most of which I deleted.  I does include trial of McAfee and Office, 30 or 60 day trials on these.  I am more than satisfied with this PC, using it for Internet surfing mostly, casual computing I suppose.  Check out the Acer website as I heard a newer version is already in production, although it's also more expensive.

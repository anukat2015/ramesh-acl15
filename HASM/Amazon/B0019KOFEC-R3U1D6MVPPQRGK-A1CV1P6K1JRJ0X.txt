Title: Eureka Pet Lover Mighty Mite 3684F
Content:
This vacuum has great suction, like many have stated.  There are a few issues that caused me to only rate it 3 stars.
1.  The hose will send you right over the edge.  It's cheap and like others noted becomes statistized therefore picks up all the pet hair and dust which causes you to have to clean it before storage.
2.  I don't like the tools.  I have hardwood floors and always use a good attachment with bristles that glides easily on the floor - this vacuum doesn't have that.  Instead it comes with the attachment and glide wheels which make it difficult to go around and under furniture.
3. I do not care for the other smaller attachments either.  The combination one; bristles one side (triangular) and no bristles on the other is probably the most useless tool.  It does not get in to places like you would want due to the shape and size.
4. A positive is that it is nice and light weight.
So on this one I can say the suction is wonderful, but the praise can stop there.

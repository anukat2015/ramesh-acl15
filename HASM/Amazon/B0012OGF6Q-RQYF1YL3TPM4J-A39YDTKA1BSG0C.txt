Title: There should not be any other choice for beginners..
Content:
In one word. "perfect"..the basic lens kit works perfect..
This camera lacks Live View feature for which many prefers to buy others like Canon rebel XSI..but trust me.thats of no use..it really is not required..automatic mode will give u a feel of point n shoot camera with superb quality.battery backup is also good.color reproduction is fantastic..and yes very less noise with ISO 800 and above with Noise reduction feature ON..I do not find any reason for not buying this camera.

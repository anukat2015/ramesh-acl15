Title: don't buy
Content:
Bought two, within 6 months neither one works, probably the safety tip over switch. Of course they use propriatary screws so I can't even get into it to try and fix.  Instead of a tip over safety issue they became a trip over safty issue. Waste of money, wish I could have returned them to Home Depot.
DO NOT BUY

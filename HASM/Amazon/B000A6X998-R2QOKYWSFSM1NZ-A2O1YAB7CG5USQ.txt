Title: warmth
Content:
The Holmes HQH319-U is great for heating a room or small area.  It heats up fast, has high and low functions and can be set to a specific temperature.  
The drawbacks are it is rather large and gets hot in the front and is somewhat noisy on the high setting.  I wouldn't use it around children.

Title: How Amazon failed to respond!
Content:
My comment is about the Amazon selling the product not about the ipod. While on their site AMZN advertised that the product is eligible for free shipping after it took almost ten days for delivery I was charged a shipping fee. I have posted three e-mails (good luck to find a phone# to reach someone at Amazon) informing them about their misleading claim, but after almost a month I have not heard from them. I am not happy with the service.

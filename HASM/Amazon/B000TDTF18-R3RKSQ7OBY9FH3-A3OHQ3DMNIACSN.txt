Title: Let me Java it
Content:
The reason I am very satisfied with this coffeemaker is that I can pour water into the reservoir without moving the machine. Just swing open the funnel-like door and pour water into it. It is very convenient and also will save the rubber shoes under the coffeemaker from wearing out when sliding the machine back and forth into place, which you have to do with other machines that have the fliptop reservoir. I also like the 'Aroma' selection that makes the coffee brew slower and tastier. Overall, I am very satisfied with this coffeemaker.

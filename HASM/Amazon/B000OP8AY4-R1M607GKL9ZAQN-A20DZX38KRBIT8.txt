Title: Was a good laptop for about 6 months
Content:
After about 6 months I noticed mass amounts of heat emitting from this laptop to dangerous levels, it could burn your hand!!!  Fan runs non stop for some reason and it required external cooling espessially when runnning VISTA which this unit has major trouble handleing.  I broght this piece of crap back and got a Macbook Pro with Leopard....so much better!

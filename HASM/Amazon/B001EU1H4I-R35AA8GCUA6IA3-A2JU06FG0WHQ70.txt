We had always had an undercounter coffee maker. When the last one crapped out and the repair shop couldn't fix or replace it we had to shop. Shopping is easy, there is only one manufacturer with one model. No stores in Kansas City stocked it, we had to order from Amazon. The first one: the clock didn't work correctly, the warming plate did not keep warm, and the loud banging noises when it brewed made it unusable and life unbearable. When the 2nd unit arrived we returned the first one. UPS charged $20.00 to return, Amazon reimbersed only $11.00, so bad QC in China cost us $9.00 additional, plus the time consumed in phone calls, emails, and trips. The newer one works better, but is still noisy.
If there is any way you can avoid buying this piece of crap, do so. It is too bad that Black and Decker owns the market for a device like this, only to put out this horrible piece of junk, with little regard for the consumer.

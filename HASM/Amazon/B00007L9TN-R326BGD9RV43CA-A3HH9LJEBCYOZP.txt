I bought 4 of these heaters at the same time, to be used throughout several rooms in my home.  One of the heaters had to go back the same day of purchase, as it would not even work.  There was a broken part noise and definitely a small piece of "something" that was free-floating inside the heater.  That left me with 3, as I opted not to replace the one that was taken back.  The other 3 worked fine initially. Within a very short period, two out of 3 developed thermostat issues.  The two with thermostat problems will now only work on the highest setting, which is basically a forced setting.  They will no longer kick off/on by themselves.  Not sure if these heaters were just poorly made or if perhaps they were damaged during transit or their distribution phase.  I am more inclined to believe they were just simply thrown together and cheaply made.  They do heat well on the highest setting, however this is rarely needed.  Unless I am mistaken, these heaters are made in China.  I also own two Marvin quartz heaters, both of which were made in the USA. I must say, I have had the Marvin heaters for a number of years and never had any problems, except replacing the odd quartz heating element. Too bad that company went out of business, because I much preferred the better quality Marvin brand.  I would NOT recommend these Holmes heaters, unless you are prepared to deal with thermostat or other issues from their shoddy workmanship or transit process.  Don't waste your money on this poor quality item!!

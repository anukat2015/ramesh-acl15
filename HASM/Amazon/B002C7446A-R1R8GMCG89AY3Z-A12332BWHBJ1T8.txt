Title: I have now converted from PC to MAC...
Content:
I love this laptop...  It is fast, beautiful and affordable.  My favorite aspect of it is the mousepad.  It is so intuitive, fun and easy to use.   Although it doesn't have as much memory and features as PC's that are similarly priced it performs so much better than PC's.  It is such a pleasure to use the programs.  They are all fast and well-designed.  In addition, the glossy screen that people mentioned is not as problematic as you think.  I would prefer the matte screen if it was offered, but the glossy screen does not bother me one bit.  For 15 dollars you could buy a protective layer that makes the screen matte for macs.  All you need to do is just a little research.

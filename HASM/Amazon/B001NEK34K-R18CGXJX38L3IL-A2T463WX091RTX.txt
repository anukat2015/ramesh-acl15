Title: I'll need to buy a seatbelt!
Content:
I'm a professional photographer and graphic designer. I run a several applicatiions at a time and process a lot of 21 megapixel images at once. This Toshiba does what I tell it to RIGHT NOW. 
You don't know what you're buying into until you have to deal with customer service. I found that the wireless internet feature didn't work and with great trepidation phoned their customer service number. I got a real person I could understand and she worked towards the solution, but had to pass me along to a higher tech who patiently worked with me. He had me un-install some stuff (I'm not a techie) and re-install it again. This took time, and he asked if he could call me back when it was done. He phoned back moments after the process finished (he must've set a timer) and resolved the problem. Now I know I not only have a computer which thoroughly meets my needs, but that I have customer support if I need it.

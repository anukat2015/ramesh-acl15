Title: Bad News Bears
Content:
My girlfriend and myself had carefully reviewed all the indoor heaters featured on this website and came to the conclusion that this product might be the best bang for the buck after reading other reviews.  Although, when we recieved the product in the mail and opened the product everthing looked like we had imagined it would. Once we plugged the heater in we noticed that it was only blowing heat out of one head unit (it is suppose to blow heat out of each unit) not two like it says in the manual.  I went ahead and plugged it in for awhile hopeing that maybe it takes some time to warm the upper one up but after a half an hour I then understood what a poor product Bioaire had produced. To make things even better the two year warranty that features with this product is as complicated as one can get. You must fill out numerous amounts of infomation on a sheet enclosed with a return shipping money order that should be paid for the trouble of recieving a faulty heater and then they say it may take 3-4 weeks to get a working on back to you. I instead will just take the 80% refund from amazon becuase for one it is a much easier process and two becuase I really don't care to try another one of these heaters again. I think that if this product did not have a history of mechanical errors then it might be worth buying buy I think I am being very fair in my critic of this heater or at least my experience with it. My advice would be skip this brand and try another one in order to save you from a similar mess!

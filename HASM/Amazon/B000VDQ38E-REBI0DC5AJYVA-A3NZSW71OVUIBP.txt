Title: Not sure yet!
Content:
I just put my vacuum together. The instructions were okay. I had read in a review about the vacuum moving on it's own. Well, believe me I wasn't prepared for how it moved so quickly away from my grip. You have to hold onto it otherwise you will tear your carpet. I have (had) two runners in my kitchen which now have to be replaced because the vacuum sucked up my rugs and ripped the edges. I am not quite sure how I feel about this item yet. I know it did pick up a lot of pet hair from my bare floors and area rugs, I am just afraid of trying it on the berber carpet in my den area. I can afford to replace runners but not a carpeted room.

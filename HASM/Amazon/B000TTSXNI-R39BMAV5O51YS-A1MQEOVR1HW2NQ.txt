Lasko 751320 Space Heater
Through years I spent a lot of money on space heaters, mainly for my wife's comfort. Practically, I threw all of them away. Heaters design had always the same faulty design: bulky, heated too much or poor heating capacity.
Lasko heater has resolved my concerns (and my wife's concerns-she just love it). Its design has fine control features for various temperature values, it heats up room space and area quickly. Not only it is effective and efficient, but  it also is ergonomic for any room application.
Heater manual is explicit and comprehensive. It has the standard warnings regarding heater application; keep it away from water sources like faucets. As an electrical engineer I know people never read the manual. I would recommend Lasko to have affixed on heater base a visible a large decal with black letters on a a yellow background: WARNING KEEP AWAY FROM WATER SOURCES. A few days ago  a Manager of a company placed this type of heater on a counter sink  where water was running all the time. I told him read the manual. I also would advise  Lasko: Send a decal like the above to their customers. You avoid ignorant reviews and false statements. Myself, as an engineer when I designed a product personnel safety was key in my design functions.
Please note, this not a critic of Lasko design, but a recommendation for personnel usage: "we humans never read product manuals"
 Thank you

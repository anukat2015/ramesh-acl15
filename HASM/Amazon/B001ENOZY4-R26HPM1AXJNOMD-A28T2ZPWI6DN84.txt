Having used Nikon's D40, D60, D70, D200 & D300, the purchase of a brand new D90 fell right into place. 
This camera is for the buyer who doesnt want the "entry level" restrictions of a D60, but can't afford the D300. I wouldn't even call it a compromise on buying a D300, it's the smarter buy for me, right in the middle. 
Image quality on this camera can be equal to, and sometimes it betters that of the D300 in my oppinion. It's smaller, lighter and CHEAPER. Consider purchasing a nice Nikon speedlight to compliment this camera after having saved $400 not getting the D300. In addition, a battery grip adds to the pro feel and look of this camera while making it take 3x more pictures on 1 charge so I'd also advise you to purchase one (check out the Opteka Battery Grip for the D89/D90 - it comes with 2 extra batteries and is cheaper than the Nikon brand, they work the same way!)
The lens this camera comes with (18-105mm) is nice and you'll get good use out of it. Very good range, clean photos, just be careful not to bang it around too much the lens mount is plastic afterall.
I'm not saying that the D300 isn't a sweet camera and if you can afford it, get it - you'll be happier in the end knowing you got something more expensive than your friend next door. But if/when you think like me, being on a smaller budget and wanting to do more with it (flash, grip, camera bag, tripod), not caring about bragging rights (D3x vs. D90 - wouldn't bother me if I know what I'm doing with the D90) and knowing that the photographer's skill is usually better than the camera's technology, you WILL want a D90.

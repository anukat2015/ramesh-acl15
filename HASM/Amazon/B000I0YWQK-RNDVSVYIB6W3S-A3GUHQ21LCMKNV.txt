Title: Poor Quality - units failure
Content:
Oscillating capability stopped after 1 month.  Now complete failure.  It appears the IC devices through which the power runs to each of these circuits has failed.  Thermostat never accurately controlled the temperature.  A design that relies on complex (and cheap) electronics is bound to fail.

Title: Almost perfect
Content:
This machine is reliable, fast-booting, and fast-performing, thanks to a fast processor, enough RAM and a 7200 rpm hard drive. I use the GIMP (similar to Photoshop) for graphics and Adobe Premiere Elements for video editing and it handles these tasks with ease, even with Norton Internet Security and several other things running in the background. Build quality is sound. Keyboard has a good solid feel and is plenty wide enough. Overall, it's terrific and I would buy another Asus. If you're looking for an excellent laptop at a good price, this is the one, if you ask me. There are a few drawbacks, but nothing major: I don't like the touchpad too much--it seems to have a hard time putting the cursor where I want it and I have to press down fairly hard to get the cursor to move bottom to top. It has a lot of fancy features like three-finger swipe, rotate, etc., but these were kicking in accidentally a lot, so I turned them all off. The screen has a little piece of crud in between the plastic outer cover and the actual display--not a big deal, but like an itch you can't scratch. The external off/on switch for the wi-fi & bluetooth is very handy to have, but it's right next to a USB port and it's easy to hit the switch when changing out devices and turn wi-fi off by mistake (at least with my hands). All these shortcomings have been small compared to the overall experience. Like the review title says, this laptop is almost perfect.

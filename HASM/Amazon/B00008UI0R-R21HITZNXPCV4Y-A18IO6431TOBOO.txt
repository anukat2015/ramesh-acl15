Title: June 25, 2007 thats how long ago i ordered this and it quit working within a year..... ARGH
Content:
June 25, 2007  I at first LOVED this machine.
I couldnt say enought about it.
However within a year it started to dissintegrate before my eyes.
The first part to go was the vaccuum head. It would work then not. Now its to the point i must unplug the unit to turn it off. Next came the release mechanism to use the pipe without the vaccuum head, the plastic release snapped off .. I am 40 not 4 and pamper my belongings. This unit was disappointing and now I need to purchase a new machine....

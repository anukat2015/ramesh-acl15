Title: Lame, lame, lame.
Content:
I think this machine is lame.  It is not solid what-so-ever.  The carafe is a joke - as my coffee is luke warm within two hours. A small piece of plastic (the "lid") you have to put on after brewing just does not cut it.  The review that mentions it does not really take a "4" filter is right on...you have to be carful the hot water spout (not sure what that is called) is over the ground beans and does not get hung up on the "4" filter paper....or you have a mess on your hands.  Maybe I got a lemon - but the water also does not saturate the beans, leaving part of them actually dry after the brewing cycle. Weak coffee and a waste of beans!
This machine is NOT worth anywhere near the $80 - $90 price tag.  I would rather have a $30 Target special Mr. Coffee at this point...no joke.

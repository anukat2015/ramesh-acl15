Title: Great features, easy to use
Content:
I could have purchased any MP3 player - including an iPod - but chose the Zen Micro because it seemed to offer much more flexibility.  I have been using the player for over two months now and couldn't be happier with my decision.  The interface is intuitive and easy (even for those over 35) to use.  The Zen is rugged and very durable - particularly with the optional case.  I think the best feature is the removable battery which like a cell phone can be easily replaced - unlike the iPod.  So far the battery lasts well over 10-12 hours between charges and it is nice to know it can easily be replaced when it dies someday (again unlike the iPod).  
Songs are easily downloaded onto the player from any platform unlike being locked into using iTunes.  My particular player glows with a neon blue light around the edges that gives it a level of "hipness" - even my teenage sons think it is cool.
If you are not a slave to iTunes, the Zen is a perfect choice for an easy to use, durable MP3 player.

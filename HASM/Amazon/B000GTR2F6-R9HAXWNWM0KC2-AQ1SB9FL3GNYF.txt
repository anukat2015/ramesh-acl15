Title: returned
Content:
I returned it. It was broken when I received it.  I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff.   I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything.  I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.

Title: Great Choice!
Content:
We bought this coffee pot to replace our old Bunn coffee pot after many years of great coffee!
It's really a great choice, and very convenient as you can take the thermal coffeemaker pot directly
from the unit to the breakfast table. As stated in other reviews, it takes some care to line up
the coffee pot lid so that it is "open" when making coffee. Other than that, it's been the best.

Title: Not as good as the previous Pro model
Content:
First and foremost this product makes excellent coffee.
But (there's always a but isn't there) the water feed usually creates bubbles in the watermeasure tube and is difficult to fix each time...
the Programming control does not have a manual override; it is supposed to not go on if there is no water in the coffeemaker but sometimes it cuts on at the scheduled time even if the water has not been loaded in it...
It is better, and safer, to unprogram it if you do not intend for it to go on at the scheduled time.

Title: froze and quit working
Content:
I was loving this until it just froze up and wouldn't do anything. I couldn't even power down unless I removed the battery. After troubleshooting with SanDisk support, they advised me to return it. It was just past the 30 day Amazon return policy, so I'm sending it back to SanDisk and they're sending me a new one.
They offered to replace it so quickly and based on the message board here, this seems to be a fairly common issue with the m- series. I noticed that the SanDisk support line no longer even mentions the m-series, only c and e. I wonder if they are doing away with the m's.

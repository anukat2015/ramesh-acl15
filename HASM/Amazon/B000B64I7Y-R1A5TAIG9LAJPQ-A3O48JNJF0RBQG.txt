Title: Ipod Killer, Spectacular!
Content:
I currently own a 2GB Ipod Nano and just recently purchased the Samsung YP-T8X (to play videos). In my opinion, the Samsung is a superior product. The 1.8" screen is fantastic. The colors are rich and vibrant and the sound quality blows my Nano away. I chose to purchase the 512MB player instead of the 1GB, because I haven't even used half of the Nano's storage space yet.
However, I haven't looked twice at my Nano since purchasing this player. My only regret is not purchasing the 1GB player and that Samsung's 2GB (YP-T8A) version isn't available yet in the US. What a pity!
This player is an excellent choice for those with smaller media collections. If Samsung makes the 2GB version available in the US, I'm ditching the Nano altogether.
To those who ask the question, Is 512MB really enough space for anything?  The answer is yes. I've been able to get music, photos, text and video (converted to smaller format) on the player and still have more than half of the storage left.  
However, if you have a huge multimedia library (which you wish to carry around with you all the time) 512MB or 1GB is not going to be suitable for your needs.

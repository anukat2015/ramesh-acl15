Title: Carpet attachment clogs easily
Content:
The carpet attachment has clogged twice in the handful of times I've used it.  The first time, I had to take off six screws to unclog.  The second time, I managed to clear it with a long screw-driver and the wand was also clogged.  My 15-yr old Hoover picked up better.

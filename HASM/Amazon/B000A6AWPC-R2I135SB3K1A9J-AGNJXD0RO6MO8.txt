Title: Good replacement unit
Content:
I have two kerosene heaters, a Robeson (K-Mart) which is 25+ years old, and a Kerosun which is about 10 years old.  Both work perfectly, year after year, with minimal starting and no operating odor, even with old kerosene.  (I do add kerosene treatment which seems to stabilize the kerosene and claims to reduce the odor.)  However, the Robeson does not have a cartridge tank, and I got tired of lugging it outside to refill.  The Kerosun spoiled me.
The CT-1100 arrived promptly, and seems to be intermediate in quality between the Robeson and Kerosun.  As expected it was smelly for the first few hours, but no significant smoke starting or stopping.  After doing a dry wick burn, there is still a slight but annoying odor when operating.  If I did not have the other two, I would probably consider it normal.  After setting the wick, I regularly get 18+ hour burn times, which compares with the Kerosun which has the same size tank.  I plan to work with it for the rest of the season, and if the odor continues, will replace the wick when warmer weather arrives.  It definitely seems flimsier than those in the other two heaters.
So far no real problems with good heat output and much greater convenience and safety.  It compares well with the Kerosun in design, though the sheet metal is clearly of a lighter but completely acceptable gauge.

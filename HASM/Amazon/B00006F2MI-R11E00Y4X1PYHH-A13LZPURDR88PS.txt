Title: Better than expected
Content:
I recently purchased the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew Thermal coffee pot for my husband as an anniversary present.  I read several of the reviews and was concerned about some of the critisism about it.  So far, I have been happy with this item.  It does take a little more work as you need to clean the coffee grinder after each use, but it doesn't take long to clean (maybe 1 minute.)  The grinder is quieter than I thought it would be and it grinds the coffee very fine leaving no big pieces that some have claimed it does.  It is made of stainless steel and it looks wonderful.  I would recommend using a stainless steel polish on it to make it look better.  My only major complaint is that you have to tip the caraffe almost upside down to pour the coffee.  Overall, we are happy and my husband loved it.

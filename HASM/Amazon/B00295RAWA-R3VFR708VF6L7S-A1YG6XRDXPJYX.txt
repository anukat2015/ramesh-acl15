Title: Great travel size But can't watch a movie. There is no DVD Player!
Content:
I like size but would rather buy a small weight Vaio with a Blu Ray Disk player for my use so I could use DVD's in the newest format and that would be worth the extra money. So until they can add that kind of entertainment it seems no better than having a I Touch actually better to have something like that than just a very small computer you can't use for many things yet.
No Thanks I would stick with Sony Vaio computers with lowest weight and be entertained and have it all!! OH Yeah! BS

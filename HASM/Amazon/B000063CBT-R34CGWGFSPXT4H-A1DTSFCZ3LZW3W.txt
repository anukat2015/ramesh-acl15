Title: Ok Coffee Really Really Bad Espresso
Content:
The coffee maker is ok. You can't open and remove the old grounds without removing the pot. To fill the water you have to take out the water holder to see how much water your putting in, bad for people that have to place it under a cabinet. And no matter what anyone says, the espresso is NO GOOD, and the wand is junk. Dont ever buy an espresso machine that has a plastic wand on the end. If they're that cheap, you know the whole thing is junk. Which it is!!!!!!!!!!!

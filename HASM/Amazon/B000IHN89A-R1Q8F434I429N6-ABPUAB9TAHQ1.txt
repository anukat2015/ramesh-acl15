Title: Great digital - great SLR
Content:
We took over a thousand shots with our new camera in the past four weeks.  We find it very easy to use and the images are excellent.  We have used the highest quality setting and still get 300+ shots per 2GB card.  The battery runs and runs.  There is no hesitation between pressing the shot button and the lens operation - something we have had in our previous Sony and HP digital cameras.  It is heavy - about the same as our standard film Pentax SLR but it is solid and the anti shake feature works well. We will try out our telephoto lens next - all our lenses from our old Pentax SLR camera work well with the digital SLR - saving us lots of $$$.  Love it!!!!

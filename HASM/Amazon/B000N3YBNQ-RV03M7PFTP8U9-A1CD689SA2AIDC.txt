Title: Electrolux Intensity - good suction, bad wheels
Content:
The Electrolux Intensity is an impressive design with incredible suction power.  It was perfect for what we wanted and did a phenomenal job of cleaning for one day.  Then both wheels broke and fell off on day two.  Doing a search on "Intensity" and "broken wheels" showed this was a common problem.

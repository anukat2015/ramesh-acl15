Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
Just bought the Panasonic canister vacuum with the power head to replace an Oreck upright and a backpack commercial unit.  We have several dogs that shed every summer and the Oreck just couldn't pick up the dog hair from our carpets.  But this new Panasonic does a fantastic job - no rolling the hair into balls that I have to pick up later.  And it even picks-up airsoft pellets from medium pile carpet too. It's the best vacuum we've ever used!  And not nearly as expensive as a lot of its competitors. My only suggestion would be to buy an inexpensive pipe snake from the hardware store as the hose does tend to clog, but this just shows how much "stuff" the other vacuums were not picking up.

Title: AWFUL - DO NOT BUY A VAIO
Content:
Vaio's are terrible computers. Mine has been incredibly slow since I bought it and now my hard drive stopped working properly and I can't turn it on. When I went to the Sony website for help they told me it would cost $280 to fix. Outrageous. I had an HP for five years with no problems, Vaio's are garbage, don't waste your money.

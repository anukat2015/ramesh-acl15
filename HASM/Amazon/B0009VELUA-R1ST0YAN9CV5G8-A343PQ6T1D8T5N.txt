Title: Love this coffee maker
Content:
We are serious about good coffee and this maker provides just that.  But the added convenience of the the on- demand feature is a major bonus.  No carafe to rinse, no coffee spills on the counter. It sounds like a small thing, but you'd be amazed how much tidier the kitchen stays with this machine.  We have had no problem, as mentioned in an earlier review with a "plastic" taste to the coffee....  But we did run the whole system several times with plain water before making our first pot.  The single down side we have found is that you can't fit a tall "go" container under the spout, so if you're one of those who's always taking coffee with you, this probably won't be the maker for you.

Title: I'm a dog owner who loves this vacuum
Content:
I have a little white Maltese and a dark brown sectional sofa that attacts every particle in circulation.  Even though Malteses don't actually shed, they do lose their hair like humans.  So between his hair and a couch that quickly embeds whatever touches it, I have tried three vacuums that did not even begin to address the problem. However, the Mighty Might pet attachment is fantastic!  The rotating brush really does a great job and the suction is very strong.  While I agree with others that the vacuum itself seems a little cheap (practically everything is plastic), it has very good suction.  It does a good job on area rugs and hardwood floors and is very light weight and portable for use on my carpeted stairs.  I'm very happy with this product.

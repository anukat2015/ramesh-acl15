Title: Great Camera
Content:
I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me.
I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon.
I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point & Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday.
Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera.
I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures.
I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it.
I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent.
For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned.
I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!!
This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone.

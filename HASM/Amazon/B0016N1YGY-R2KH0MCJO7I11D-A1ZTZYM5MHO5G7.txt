Title: Keeps Me Cool!
Content:
I had a Sharp unit that finally gave out and when searching Amazon I found this new DeLonghi air conditioner with eco-friendly refrigerant. I have always liked DeLonghi products for their stylish looks and this air conditioner is no execption. 
I have a metal roof with vaulted ceilings and when it gets hot the upstairs loft gets about 10* hotter than the rest of the house and since this is where I sleep I need some extra comfort. We turn it on around dinner time and put it in the turbo function that uses both water and air cooling to bring the temperature down and then when we get ready for bed we turn it down to the sleep function which is pretty quite for an air conditioner. 
I like the easy to read LCD display and the super cooling with the water tank really helps get the room temperature down quickly. This is a solid unit that weighs about 130 pounds so the casters and built in handles help in moving it around. It has all the bells and whistles with 24 hour timer, auto/sleep function, turbo cooling and even dehumidifies. The R410a eco-friendly gas refrigerant was a bonus as I try to do my part to help the enviornment.

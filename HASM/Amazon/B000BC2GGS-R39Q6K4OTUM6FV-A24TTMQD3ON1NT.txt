Title: Big, quiet heater
Content:
This thing surprised me with its size. Definitely measure before buying; this heater just fits in the space meant for it. Also, it's so quiet compared to my last heater (a little Vornado) that I sometimes forget to turn it off. (No big deal, apart from the cost of the electricity.)
Otherwise, it's an excellent space heater. I was influenced to buy it by a consumer publication that dislikes being quoted or cited; it fully deserves their Best Buy rating.

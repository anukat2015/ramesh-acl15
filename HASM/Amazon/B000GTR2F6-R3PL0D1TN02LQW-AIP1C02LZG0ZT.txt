Title: Great for a Group House or Small Office
Content:
Absolutely love this machine!  First off- it's very economical.  If you use amazon's subcription service for the K-Cups, you end up paying between 34 - 40 cents per cup of coffee.  I got this because I work in a very small office and it was such a pain making coffee each day.  There was always a squabble over who had to make the coffee, how strong, what flavor, emptying the pot, refilling the pot, when to start making the coffee, cleaning up the grounds, and washing things after.  With th Keurig machine, there's no fuss and no muss!  Your office stays clean, everyone has a fresh cup of coffee that's brewed the way they want it, and there's no need to head to starbucks and spend $3.00 each day!  Highly recommend it if your in a house or office with more than 3 people who drink coffee or tea.  It's even great for hot cocoa using the ghiradelli packs!  
UPDATE: Just wanted to say that I have had this machine for over a year now, and it's still doing great!  Amazing product, and great taste!

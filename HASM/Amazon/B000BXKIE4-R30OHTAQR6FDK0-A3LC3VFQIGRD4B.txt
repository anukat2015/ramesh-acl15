Title: Nice and quiet
Content:
The vacuum works really well to clean medium to low carpet in my apartment!  It is quiet so I can clean at night and not disturb my neighbor up and below my room.  
The only problem I found so far (using for 2 months) is that it doesn't turn very well. You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum to turn the unit.

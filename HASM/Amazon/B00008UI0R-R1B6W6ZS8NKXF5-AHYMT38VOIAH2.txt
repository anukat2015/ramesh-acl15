Title: Powerful Enough to Clean Shag Rugs!
Content:
I'm very impressed with this vacuum.  After weeks of researching a product that would be powerful enough to clean shag rugs, I listened to my fellow reviewers and purchased this Hoover.  I'm very imperessed with its suction (it picked up a dime that had been buried in the shag), and it's maneuverability.  The power head is low enough to fit under most sofas with ease, and it's so easy to switch between carpet and hardwood settings.  The canister is simple to empty and rinse, although it does get full quickly.  But maybe that's because my shag hadn't been vacuumed thoroughly in the past!  
The only drawback to this product is the difficulty of vacuuming the stairs, which I believe is a drawback to EVERY canister vacuum.  Maybe it should come with a shoulder strap--it's certainly light enough to carry.

Title: Good Value for the Price
Content:
After purchasing a more expensive heater which failed just after one year, I was looking for an inexpensive heater that would last, get the job done, and not make me pay for a lot of bells and whistles.  This fits the bill admirably, with a simple 2-level heating control.  It is also warrented for three years.

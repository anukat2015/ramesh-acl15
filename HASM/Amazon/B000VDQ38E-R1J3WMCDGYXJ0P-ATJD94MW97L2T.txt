Title: Un-Impressed
Content:
I was very unimpressed with this vacuum and quickly returned it.  First of all, its very large, heavy and clunky.  Its tough to navigate through a small room or cramped room.  Yes it picked up dirt, but didnt seem all that better than my 18 year old Hoover.  Also, the power button is on the front which is annoying if you need to power down quickly.  Every upright I ever used had the power as a foot pedal.  I'm gonna save my money and buy a Dyson.

Title: This thing sucks (and not in a good way)
Content:
I never write reviews, but this cleaner changed my mode of operation. We owned this contraption almost a week (any longer and I would have needed to buy another bottle of Scotch). I must admit that the therory behind this unit sounded great, it looked pretty cool and overall the design seemed kind of high tech. Where it all started to go wrong was when we decided to actually plug the thing in. After about 30 seconds of vacuuming, it started to smell hot....(like grab the fire extinguisher hot) but I thought well, it's new and somethings start out that way. Then I grabbed the bottom of the debris canister and almost burnt my hand. (that's usually a great indication that something is wrong!) But I really wanted to give this thing the benefit of the doubt so we used it for a few more days (just a note; my wife vacuums every day due to 2 small dogs and a cat so it's not like we were trying to suck up the city dump)The last straw was when it left oil spots (about 2 dozen) across our cream colored rug! We now have a Hoover Wind Tunnel sitting in our closet which we like alot and my wife has almost quit screaming obscenities. Hope you find this helpful, and except for the economy and most all of congress I'm a pretty happy guy.

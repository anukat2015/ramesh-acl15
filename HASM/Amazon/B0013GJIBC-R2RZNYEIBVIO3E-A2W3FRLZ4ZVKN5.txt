Title: simple & sweet ^_____^
Content:
Its no super fancy device, but it works. With radio, video, music, photo/text viewers, & a recording device, not to mention a compact design--It works for me! To upload is simple: just drag from folder to folder! It does have its quirks, and like anything new it takes a bit of getting used to, but I really enjoy it! All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase! ^____^

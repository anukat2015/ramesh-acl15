Title: Best Shuffle in my opinion.
Content:
I really like this versin of iPod shuffle. Its so small that it really goes anywhere. 
I take it snowbiardng and I don't have to worry about my other iPod getting fudged up.
A lot fo people criticize the controls on the heaphones, but, i appluad APPLE for trying something new. It really does seem to make the shuffle that much smaller with no controls.

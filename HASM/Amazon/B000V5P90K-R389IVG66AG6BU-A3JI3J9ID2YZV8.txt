Title: Canon 40D
Content:
I'm only an amateur photographer and this is the first SLR I've ever owned. My first camera was a Canon powershot G6. Now that you know my point of reference....
The 40D is a top notch camera. I've owned mine for 5 months now. I've had no problems with any of the functions (everything operates like a well oiled machine)and for this being my first SLR I had no problems getting to know it, in other words it's user friendly. 
Picture quality with Canon can't be beat. You'll not be dissatisfied.

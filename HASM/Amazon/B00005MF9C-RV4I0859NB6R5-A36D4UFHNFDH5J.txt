Title: Liked it so bought another one!
Content:
My sister gave me one of these as a gift a few years ago. I am the sole coffee-drinker in my house so it is a perfect size for me. I use it every morning. I use filtered water, grind whole coffee beans, and mix them with something called Teechino from the natural foods store. (I like the almond amaretto flavor best.) That way, I can brew the full, large mug and not get too much caffeine. Works for me. I use  paper #2 Melitta filters, rather than the permanent filter, to eliminate the  bitter oils, which are also supposedly bad for you. 
Anyway, I love this appliance, sometimes I even pack it in my suitcase on trips, and I just bought a new one because the old one is starting to sputter a bit after 1000 uses!
Just a warning - ALL the tall drink mugs in this world, especially those with handles, are very "tippy" so don't have them where a spill would be a disaster (near paperwork, homework, computer, small kids, silk dress,etc!)

Title: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
Content:
This product is nothing but a humidifier.  I live in a dry area, and used it to cool down a 300sqft room.  It didn't work even when I put tons of ice in the machine, on the machine, around the machine.  All it did was make it feel musty and wet when anyone walked into the house from outside.  I bought two to use in the same room, and it still didn't work.  I think anyone would be better off buying a $350 portable AC unit.  Dont waste you money on this one.

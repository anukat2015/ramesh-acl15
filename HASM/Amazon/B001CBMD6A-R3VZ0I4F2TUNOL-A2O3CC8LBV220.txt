Title: Old Canon / New Canon
Content:
I purchased this camera for my Daughter as a Christmas present. She wanted a digital SLR because she believed she would have more creative latitude with a changeable lens and wanted the 10+ MP. I bought this particular camera because I had reviewed the Canon manual for this model on line before I decided on a manufacture brand and was instantly reminded why I am biased towards Canon; ease of use, intuitive to understand, competitive price and reliable (well, we will see). I had a Canon AE-1 that lasted over twenty-five years with very few problems. Hope this one gives us the same joy and reliability. Ordering and delivery was fast and uneventful, just what I was hoping for.

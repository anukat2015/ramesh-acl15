Title: I am very happy with my first SLR
Content:
In January I moved from the Canon S2 to the XTI and I'm really glad I did. I haven't picked the S2 up ever since. It's very easy to use, with a very small learning curve if your moving from an advanced point and shoot. 
Pros:
-The camera shoots fast enough for me, 3fps is more than I need.
-ISO to 800 is usable. 1600 is there if you have to use it but only in a no-flash dark environment where sharpness is critical. Trust me, the results can be used but you'll have to run the photos though noise ninja or something similar. 
-All of the settings are really easy to get to and change.
-The 10.1 mp are more than enough to allow you to crop for mistakes you might make.
-Depending on the lens, focus is scary fast and accurate. It'll make you never want to pick up that P @ S ever again.
Cons:
-No live view. This makes it tough for me to take shots with the camera close to the ground. With the Canon S2, I could twist the LCD and see what I was focusing on. There are accessories that allow you to see the viewfinder at an angle but they're expensive.
-No Spot-meter
-Dust reduction thing is really a gimmick more than it is usable I think. I still get some dust on the sensor I have to clean off from time to time that the dust feature won't shake off. 
-The body isn't the most comfortable to hold when you've got a long lens on. Pick up the battery grip to make this thing feel better in your hands.
-The build quality is average. Don't expect an all-metal body for this price, most of the camera is plastic and there are no weather seals.
Over-all for the price and the quality of the pictures I couldn't be more pleased with this camera. The #1 most important thing to me was picture quality and it never disappoints (except at ISO 1600). If you're on a budget and you don't have to have live-view, go with the XTI. You'll won't regret your decision.

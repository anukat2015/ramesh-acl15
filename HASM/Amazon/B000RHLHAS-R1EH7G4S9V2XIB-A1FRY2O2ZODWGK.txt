Title: Honeywell HZ-341 good for small spaces
Content:
Bought this heater as an alternative to turning on central heating. A big draw was the digital (readout) thermostat, timer, and oscillating functions.
Pros: fan kicks out decent heat; fairly easy to use, with clear documentation included; lightweight and portable.
Cons: sensitive thermostat that pretty much detects the temperature of the heater's immediate surroundings (I'd guess about no more than 2 feet radius), but I was overly ambitious in hoping the Honeywell would work to heat a larger room; fan can be loud (think sleep mode, or especially if you have it set on a thermostat and the heater kicks in and out), but it's fine for any other activities. Timer function increments only by the hour.
Verdict: use it as a spot heater and you won't be disappointed, it's a good value (though I am not factoring in the electric bill). I was going to buy a second unit for another bedroom, but I could not sleep with the sound of the fan turning on and off in the middle of the night. That said, I am really glad I got the unit for regular heating duty.

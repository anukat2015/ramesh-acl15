Title: Best coffee maker I've ever owned
Content:
I make around a dozen pots of coffee each week.  That means that I have owned a lot of different coffee makers in the past.  In the last ... years I have used and discarded ...machines.  This machine is far better than any machine you could buy for [$$$], but it does cost almost [$$$].  I have been using it for ... months and love the hot fresh tasting coffee.  I have not yet replaced the water filter because the only place I have seen a replacement water filter is on the Cuisinart web site and they treat the water filter as a high end replacement part.  Nothing is perfect, but for a home machine this comes pretty close.

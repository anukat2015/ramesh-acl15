Title: Great Camera
Content:
This camera is great. Feel comfortable taking photos ISO 800 and beyond. I don't really miss many photo opportunities. So much control and your fingers too. Seems to be a dedicated button for everything within easy reach. Well done sony. Now if you could get a few more lenses in your lineup...

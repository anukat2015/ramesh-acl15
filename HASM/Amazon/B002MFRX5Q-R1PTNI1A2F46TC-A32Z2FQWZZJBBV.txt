Title: To much trouble
Content:
Once you get you hand through the area between the hand strap and the camera, spend several minutes adjusting the strap, I guess this works OK.  It has three points of attachment which makes it hard to get your hand in.  Ended up putting in the drawer and purchased a hand strap with just two points of attachment.  It works much better than this one.

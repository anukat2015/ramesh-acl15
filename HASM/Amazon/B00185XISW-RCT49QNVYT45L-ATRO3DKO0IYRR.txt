Title: it works, but...
Content:
This heater works for us providing additional heat to the baby's room which gets central heat but has a lot of windows and wasn't as warm as the rest of the house.  Now we can make his room warmer, which is great!  Beware of the mounting hardware though... The screws were very hard to screw into the plastic drywall anchors causing 1 of the anchors to turn in the wall and strip the mounting hole.  Replaced with 4" steel bolts and butterfly anchors, which worked great and should have been provided by the manufacturer instead of the cheap, defective molded plastic anchors.  May still need a thermostat and a bit concerned about the cracking noted by other users of more than 1 year.  I will update this review in a year or 2 concerning reliablitily.

Title: Good Heater, Bad Shipping
Content:
The heater so far as met my expectations. It was highly rated by Consumer Reports and seem to operate as advertised. The unit is quiet and the thermostat cycles the heater to maintain the set temperature. It fits along the baseboard without taking up to much room. The only negative experience was that Amazon ships it in the original manufacturer's box and UPs damaged product and destroyed the box. If it had been shipped in a seperate container the product would have probably been ok. It was kind of a hassle to report the damage but Amazon eventually corrected everything. I had to wait for another heater to be shipped.

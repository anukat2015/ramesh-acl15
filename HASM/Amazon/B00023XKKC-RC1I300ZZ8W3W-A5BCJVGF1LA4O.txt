Title: 3 in one--who would have thought it would work so well
Content:
To have an AC, dehumidifier and heater all in one, and have them all work very well for only 450 dollars is excellent! The Soleus dehumidifiers all have such good ratings so I thought I  would try this model so I could very its function depending on my needs and the weather.  I have been impressed--I would recommend this to anyone living in an area where the conditions always seem to be changing.

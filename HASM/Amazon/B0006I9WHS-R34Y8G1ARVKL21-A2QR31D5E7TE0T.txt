Title: I love this thing
Content:
I have a walk-out basement. It gets cold in the winter. Somebody recommended using a ceramic heater. I chose this one based on favorable online reviews. I was not disappointed. It's quite potent. Yes, the thermostat doesn't quite regulate as well as the product description claims. But the price is right, it's sturdy, and it keeps you warm in your cold basement.

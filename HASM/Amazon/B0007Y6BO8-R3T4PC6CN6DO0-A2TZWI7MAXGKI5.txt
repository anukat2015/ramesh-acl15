Title: Still the best affordable drip coffee maker
Content:
I owned more than a few Krups drip coffee makers over the years, before  moving on to espresso. I chose them based on back to back comparisons, and found them to be the best in their price range. I never compared them to the expensive Dutch Technivorm (now $235), however. 
When a new job found my wife in temporary housing, I had to get her a decent drip maker until our move is complete. This was the one I chose, and it has exceeded my expectations. It effortlessly makes flavorful, hot coffee. It is supremely ergonomic and simple to program and use. I can only assume that Krups has improved it since some of the reviews here were written. Programing is elementary, for those who want to awaken to hot coffee. (I roast my beans and so rarely choose to allow the ground coffee to sit overnight.) But once set, the program can be toggled on and off with a single push of a button. The carafe is very nicely made, and requires really sloppy (read impatient) technique to spill. Previous Krups carafes  had a "flavor-enhancing" feature, in the form of a grid over the spout of the carafe, which is supposed to limit aroma escaping while brewing, but which made pouring without spilling a struggle. This one does not have that feature and, for me, works very well.
I find it a joy to use, and, at this price, an excellent buy.

Title: Not that Great
Content:
Don't waste your money. Did not heat the area in my home it was intended for. It looks nice though and oscillates, but I was not pleased with the units ability to heat the room -- and I bought 2 of them for the same space and it still wasn't that warm. (A little Warmer, but not warm)

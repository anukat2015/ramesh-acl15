Title: Better than the others
Content:
This is not a perfect vacuum but for someone who has purchased others, the Uno is stellar. Yes, the cup is small but it has no filter in it which is a plus - just empty and move on.
I agree that the hose is awkward and the main attachment is not great. But the pros far outweigh the cons. For example, I used the Uno after vacuuming with a Daredevil and the Uno picked up an amazing amount of debris that was not visible to the eye.
We have a dog who sheds like crazy so if you have carpet or area rugs like we do, this is an excellent vacuum for the price. The suction is amazing. At the price, there is no such thing as perfection.

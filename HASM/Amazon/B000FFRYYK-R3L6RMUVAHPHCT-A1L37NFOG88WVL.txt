Title: Hot Coffee from a thermal carafe.
Content:
I bought the Bunn Btx-b coffee maker.All I can say is the coffee is good, and the coffee is hot. I did not need to preheat the carafe with hot water. Bunn must have improved the carafe because it looks different from the picture. I like it better. This truly has the same taste as good restaurant coffee. What I would like to see is on this unit is a power on off light.And an indicator light that tells you when the water tank is reheated. Just a thought.  BILL

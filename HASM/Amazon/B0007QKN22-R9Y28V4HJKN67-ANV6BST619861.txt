Title: AWESOME
Content:
Bought this camera after reviewing it against the Nikon D50.  Although the D50 felt more comfortable in my hand (the grip), the Canon was lighter and a 8.1 vs 6.1 megapixel.  I took the Canon to Maui and it took INCREDIBLE pictures.  I bought it to get into the hobby of photography - but have only used the auto features.  AMAZING battery life compared to other cameras I've had.  Surprising small for a DSLR.

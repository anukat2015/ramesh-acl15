I really wanted this mp3 player and I got it.  All in all its a good MP3 player but they should have thought out some things.  Like you can duplicate songs easily, its a head ache to make playlists.  I still haven't sucessfully done it yet.  But the sound quality is great.  Battery life is pretty and its dummy proof.  Just be patient......lol

Title: Excellent choice
Content:
I have purchased two of these radiators, one for myself and one for my mother.  I find them to be simple to operate, safe, quiet and very effective.  I keep mine in our spare bedroom for guest.  The room is 20 X 20 and very cold in the winter but this radiator keeps it very comfortable.  My mother keeps her's in the living room so she can watch TV late at night without heating the whole house.  She loves it.  It is also easy to move from room to room as you wish.

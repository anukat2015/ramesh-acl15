Title: Fastest brewer and a great cup of coffee
Content:
This maker replaced a Waring Pro model.  It is really great.  It brews an entire pot in 3 min flat.  You don't have to wait, and wait, and wait.  The pour spout on the pot takes a little getting used to, because you have to do a "slow" pour or you'll have a coffee puddled counter top.  The cleanup is nice, it's really not loud at all and most importantly it makes a great pot of coffee.  If it had a timer and/or auto shutoff feature it would be absolutely perfect.  Nevertheless, for those of you who get up, run around the house getting ready for work, this appliance is a must have.

Title: Fabulous camera! Thank you Nikon!!
Content:
Bought both this camera and the Nikon 40X as Christmas gifts and everyone in the family couldn't be happier with both of these excellent cameras!
My hubby was formally trained at the New York Institute of Photography way back in the 1970s and way before digital.  It took this long for him to even consider buying a digital/SLR and he is SO HAPPY with the D-80 with this lens. I haven't seen him take this many photos since our kids were born years ago and it doesn't look like a passing thing either. We now have 4 cats so there's plenty of opportunities right there. And we look forward to our next trip as we are like 2 kids in a candy store. I am not trained in any way, so I just keep it on auto and snap away. WOW is all we can say! Read the explicit reviews for all the particulars, but just know that you can't go wrong with this camera. And the 40X has also passed with flying colors. You should also be able to find good deals on both. We've now ordered some filters & the remote, and will buy another lens. Be sure to only buy VR lenses as they are great!

PITCHED MY TOP OF THE LINE CUSSINART COULD,NT POUR A CUP OF COFFEE W/OUT A SPILL OR FILL IT W/WATER FOR THAT MATTER W/OUT WATER SPILLS. WORST SPICKET DESIGN IN THE WORLD!  IT'S LIKE WHO EVER DESIGNED IT NEVER ACTUALL USED IT!!
BUNN IS THE BEST "IMO" 3 MINUTES & YOUR ENJOYING UP TO 10 CUPS OF COFFEE!
P.S YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY SPECIAL BUNN FILTERS I USE GENERIC ONES & THEY WORK JUST FINE(NO GROUNDS IN COFFEE.
KEEPS COFFEE HOT ALL DAY LONG!  BUNN IS KING WHEN IT COMES TO COFFEE MAKERS (WISH I KNEW THAT SOONER)

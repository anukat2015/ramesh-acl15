Title: An EXCELLENT camera
Content:
It's hard to write a meaningful review when I've barely begun to get familiar with my new 40D, but so far I am NOT disappointed.  I have found no problems; all functions appear to work as advertised.  One word of advice: if you're accustomed to viewing the shot via the LCD, it CAN be done with the 40D, but is awkward.  Get used to using the optical (through-the-lens) viewfinder, like a film camera.  You can still see what you've just shot on the LCD screen, with adjustable viewing time.  Typical of Canon, this appears to be a fine camera, with features for the beginner through advanced photographers.  You can start out with "point-and-shoot" (automatic everything), and advance to as many manual settings as you like.  At this point, I recommend the 40D!  Be sure to buy a lens to match the quality of the camera; I suggest an "L" series lens.  Beware of "starter" lenses, which degrade the quality and which you will want to upgrade almost immediately.

Title: High Range of Functions, Great Cost
Content:
As a complete newcomer to the DSLR world, I wasn't sure which camera to purchase to explore the world of photography.  I thought about the XSi...the features sounded impressive, especially the Megapixels.  But a friend of mine said that after about 5MP, the numbers don't really matter unless you're planning on printing poster-size photos (which few of us would actually do).  The 8MP images of this camera are gorgeous and crystal clear--you'd never miss having a 12MP camera.  All it would do is make the file sizes HUGE, and you'll have to get an external hard drive to save your photos.  (Number of MPs is really ploy to get consumers to buy a more expensive model)
The features on this unit are vast enough for an advanced photographer but has enough automatic features on it that it will ease you into the world of photography.  I highly recommend this camera!

Title: I Cannot Say Enough...
Content:
This is by far the best camera I have ever used. It takes great shots, even in Auto mode. The kit lens works well for "people" shots, and even works well for medium-range work. I guess it's about the equivalent of a 3X Zoom on a Point-and-Shoot Digicam. The great flexibility comes in the fact that you can take off the kit lens, and attach a prime lens (meaning a fixed focal length, no zooming), for great macro work, or a telephoto for long-range photography. This is my first DSLR and I love it. The included demos make it extremely simple to understand the basics of DSLR photography relatively quickly. Once you comprehend the basics, you can take perfectly serviceable shots in Aperture- or Shutter-priority modes, and eventually make your way to full manual. I also highly recommend the following books with the camera: Nikon D40/D40x Digital Field Guide and The Digital Photography Book, and a good memory card, say 2GB to start. Those can be had for less than $20 nowadays.
The main points I want to make are: 1)read those books, or if nothing else the manual that comes with the camera, 2) experiment with taking pictures of family or just things around the house, and 3) go to a local museum, park, or point of interest and try out what you can do. Don't jump in and take your new D40 to Washington, DC or the Grand Canyon. It takes excellent photos, but only if you know what to do. Auto mode can only do so much, and it is targeted towards shots of people (completely understandable, understanding the target audience). All in all, this is an excellent camera!

Title: Great camera for the price!
Content:
I went from a Canon A-1 to this, and haven't looked back!  The greatest feature of this camera:  It's fun to use!  I guess this is a common feature to all digital cameras.  You are able to see your picture right away, and make exposure corrections as needed for that perfect picture.  This encourages you to take more pictures, and instantly learn from your mistakes.  I am not a professional photographer, but for my money, this camera is hard to beat.  I still keep my trusty A-1 at home, but this Rebel XS is the one that I'm driving around town with these days.

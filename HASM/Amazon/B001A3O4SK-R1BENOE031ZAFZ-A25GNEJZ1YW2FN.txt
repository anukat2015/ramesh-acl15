Title: warm warm warm
Content:
I tried a oil filled heater and returned it becouse of a sickning smell coming from it, then i tried a fan heater and it did not do the job for my large livingroom/diningroom/kitchen (all open)I went and got this heater and wow is all i can say, it took trial and error with other brand heaters but this one is great, i highly recommend this heater, it is safe and really throws out some heat!  I live in philly and it gets cold in my old house, but this is keeping my living area toasty!

Title: I love this Computer
Content:
I bought this Computer about 4 years ago and have had excellent luck with it. If it broke tomorrow I would still think I got a great deal. Usually with stuff I buy, things go wrong within a year of buying it. Not this baby. She is still going strong. And I didn't have to get a loan to get it either.lol. I really don't do anything buisness like on this thing so I can't comment on it's ability. I just use it for studying, Internet, Photos. etc. Just a really nice computer.

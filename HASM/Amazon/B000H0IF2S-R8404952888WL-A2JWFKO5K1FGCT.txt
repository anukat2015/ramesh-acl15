Title: Perfect!
Content:
This is my first MP3 player and I absolutely love it!  It is super easy to use, very light and fun to carry around.  I've gotten many compliments on it over the last few days, and I've recommended it to everyone I know!!  This 1GB has plenty of room to store all your favorite songs in a machine the size of a quarter.  I clip the shuffle to my suit collar and away I go!  I can easily run all over the office without having a heavy mp2 player lugging along.  The earphones are fine, although tend to get a little uncomfortable after a few hours.  I've had my shuffle running for four days straight and still haven't had to recharge!

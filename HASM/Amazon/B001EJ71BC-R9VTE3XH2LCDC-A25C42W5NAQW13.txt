Title: Downward sprial
Content:
At first when I got this product I was very happy. Cheaper than an Ipod and expandable memory. Things worked fine with it for I'd say maybe 4 months. Sound good, recording good, video good, radio good but noticed a few things wrong. 
I don't know about the rest of you but I like to have my music on shuffle. Maybe I missed something going through the menu a thousand times but there wasn't an option for that. Also the screws that hold it all together started to come loose on their own.
I mainly used it as an alternate radio in my car as it had to be repaired and also at work as I opened up the store so I didn't move it around much. I tightened the screws myself but they still always came loose again. My guess is from pushing the buttons cause the whole thing kinda bends. The last time i was able to use it, I had it on for 20 minutes turned it off to take a phone call and it never turned on since then. Not even while on the charger. Looked at it again and it was only being held by 1 screw. I replaced the screws and still wouldn't turn on. Not much help on their website either.
I probably should have just gotten an IPod or Zune. T_T

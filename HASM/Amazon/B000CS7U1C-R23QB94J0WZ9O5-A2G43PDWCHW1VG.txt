Title: So much to like, so much to be annoyed...
Content:
What a great MP3 player. What an annoying MP3 player. 
The Zen Vision M is not a study in "Zen" but more of a study in "Yin and Yang". 
> The aahhh so great: What a beautiful screen, outstanding sound quality, photo slideshows while you listen to music and the number of tweaks to the settings is almost endless. A clock, a calender, an organizer, FM radio, recorder, 0-60 in 5.6 seconds...just kidding about the last one. 
> The "what were they thinking??!!": Then there is the touch pad which is enough to send me over the edge. I hold my breath with each use of it and I have the sensitivity set down. The interface software for PC and MP3 is completely lame. It organizes the music with folders on the PC but on the player it is by the music ID tags. Try to rectify this one folks. The case should have been all black, not an oreo with one side missing. And the case needs more solidity - it flexes when you squeeze it, which you will do when you are pushing the buttons next to the touch pad. I think just looking at it wrong will cause a scratch, too. The menu interface can be like a labyrinth sometimes, too. As in, "how do I get out of here?!"
Am I done nagging? Yes, I think so. Because just like that special woman with flaws, you love her anyway because of her depth of personality. Not that I love an MP3 player, of course. I make this statement only for the purposes of drawing an analogy.
Is this the iPod killer? Nope, I don't even want to go there because that device is flawed too. But the Vision M IS darn good and fun too! Live with it's flaws and partake of its pleasures. It is a study in contrasts.

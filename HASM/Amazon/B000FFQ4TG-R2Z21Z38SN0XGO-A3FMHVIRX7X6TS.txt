Title: Bunn NHBX-B makes great coffee!
Content:
We just bought this coffee maker to replace our old one, which was on the fritz.  At first I was disappointed to see it didn't have a pause and serve feature, but then I realized since it only takes 3 minutes to brew the coffee, you really don't need the feature!  Also, the coffee it makes is so much better than our old coffee maker.  It's very smooth; whereas our prior 2 coffee makers made coffee that tasted somewhat bitter.  The only thing that would have made me like it a little bit more, is if you could pour the water in the night before.  With this model, you open the lid, turn on the warmer plate, pour in the water and when you shut the lid the coffee starts brewing.  A small price to pay for great coffee!

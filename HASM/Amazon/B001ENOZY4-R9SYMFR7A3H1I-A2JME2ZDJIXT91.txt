Title: Love It.
Content:
I just upgraded from the D80 to the D90, and have to admit I love everything about this camera. I take thousands of pictures a year and while the d80 has served me well, there have been times when I needed a video camera, and I now have a camera that can do this.
It is light, quick and well made.  It works with every lens that I purchased for the D80 and the minor upgrade in pixel quality is perfect.
While it isnt the top of the line Nikon Camera, I also didnt feel the need to spend THOUSANDS of dollars on said camera when this camera is perfect for 99% of people out there.  Ive taken wedding photos, family photos, short family interviews, nature photos, sporting photos, action photos, you name it and I probably have taken it, and it has yet to fail me.
Great camera and worth the price, but like any camera the photos are only as good as the person taking them.. so read your manual, take a class and think about the photo before you take it.

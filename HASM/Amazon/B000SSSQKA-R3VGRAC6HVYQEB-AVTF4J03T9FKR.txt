Title: panasonic vacuum
Content:
vacuum works well on carpet and bare floors. One problem is you have to change the setting each time you sweep from floor to carpeting. Has a revolving brush which picks up pet hair well but needs to be removed by hand to keep head clean.Had a hard time getting dust bags. I had to order them from the Panasonic company. I am still waiting for the bags to arrive. Seems to have good suction.

Title: The worst laptop I have ever used except for Inspirion
Content:
Next to the abomination that was the Dell Inspirion notebook this D830 is by far the worst laptop I have had the displeasure of trying to use.  I say trying because when your not always trying to fix it, restart it, unfreeze it, cleaning it for trojans, wondering why the track pad wont work, wondering why the keyboard stopped working, wondering why it's losing your important company data and crashing when you don't even touch it for a day or so you may actually get to try and use it.  The idea behind this D830 makes me laugh.....a "durable" outer shell to protect junk hardware, I can see in a Mac protected by aluminium housing but not this Dell garbage.  Since I have been composing this review on My Macbook Pro which I do most of my work on now that I have the D830, the D830 just froze up again:  no mouse, no keyboard, shutdown option greyed out.....sigh, such junk.  I guess that's why the techs here myself included have to take Dell pc/notebook repair courses from Dell so we can fix our work computers all day and maybe get some work done, this is bull.  The only thing the D830 is good for is a coaster or a riser for your Mac.  Funny thing is every Dell I have owned showed the same issues within 6 months, XPS, Inspirion, Inspirion Mini, and the unholy Dell Latitude series.  For work this thing is a complete piece of junk, company programs without malware on them barely work or run, for anything else it's also slow and clunky compared to better, lighter, higher quality lines of notebooks.  The display is also very dull and not worth the money.

Title: iPod Classic
Content:
I was very disappointed when I received my 80GB iPod Classic to learn that it was a recondition unit.  There were personal movies from the previous owner still on the unit.  I paid full price for this unit and expected a brand new unit.  The unit also had a number of scratches on the outer case.  
I was also disappointed to learn that Amazon lowered the price immediately after I order my unit.

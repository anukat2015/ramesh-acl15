Title: Great product
Content:
This is the second heater we have bought, same model. It is an excellent product that can be left on for hours at a time without a fear of it catching fire or tripping a circuit because it is not constantly draining the electricity like the forced air models. Our electrician recommended it after our circuit kept tripping due to the forced air models. There is some initial smells that need to burn off when first using it but after that it is great. Excellent product, quiet, non-intrusive.

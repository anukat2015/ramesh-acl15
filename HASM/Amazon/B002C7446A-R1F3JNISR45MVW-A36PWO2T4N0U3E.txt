Title: Best laptop I have ever owned
Content:
I switched from PC to Mac about 6 years ago and have never looked back.  I liked my previous iBook and MacBook but this new MacBook Pro is FANTASTIC!  I upgraded it to 4GB of memory and love that I have the option to go to 8GB if I ever want to.  It is significantly faster and more responsive than my previous MacBook.  
The sleek, new aluminum case is beautiful and solid!  My previous white MacBook's case cracked all the time.  I don't know why Apple still makes those dumb plastic cases.  
The battery life is very good, though it may be exaggerated in advertisements.  I guess it all depends on your usage.
I would have loved to have tried a solid state drive but they didn't offer a big enough one for this model.  But the hard drive and CD drive are both very quiet anyway.
The new display is dazzling.  It is the first thing I noticed after upgrading from my old MacBook.  All I can say is "Wow".
So far, I haven't a single complaint about my MacBook and would happily recommend it to friends.  Windows 7 has nothing on the Snow Leopard OS.

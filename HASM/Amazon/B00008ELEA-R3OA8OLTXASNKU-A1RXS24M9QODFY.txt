Title: Love this thing!
Content:
I had purchased a GE 12 cup percolator for when we have a large number of guests, as I was using a 4 cup drip for everyday.  I was so impressed with the difference in the taste of the coffee I had to purchase this upon seeing it on Amazon.   It looks great on my counter, and takes up less room than the old 4 cup drip thing.  It doesn't take long to set up at night before bed and all I have to do is plug it in in the morning.   Well worth the price and the extra few minutes to set up. 
I ordered but have not received the filters for percolators which should help with the few grounds I do get in a cup.  This has not diminished the coffee however.  I just let the 5 or so grounds come to the top and I get them out with my spoon.  I think the filters will eliminate that. 
Overall, I'm loving this cutie!

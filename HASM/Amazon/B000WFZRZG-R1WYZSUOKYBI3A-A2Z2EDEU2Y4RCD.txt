Title: Gets the Job Done
Content:
I bought it for X-Mas for my Mom(she's 50)and she LOVES it. It's simple and easy for her to use. She in turn bought me one, I like it, but the battery seems to have some issues. I usually take a one hour train ride to work, battery is full, by the time I get to work, battery is almost low. But overall, it's easy to use and it gets the job done..

Title: I've Gone to the Mac Side
Content:
I've been an IT professional for almost 20 years and just made the leap from PC to Mac. I will never go back. I love my little Mac Book and bring it with me everywhere. It is so intuitive and user friendly that I was shocked how quickly I was all set to use it. Normally when you by a PC it takes at least 1/2 hour to complete the final Windows set up, not to mention setting up your wireless and printer. The Mac did it all in less than 5 minutes.

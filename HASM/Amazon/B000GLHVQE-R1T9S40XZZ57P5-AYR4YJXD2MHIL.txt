Title: Good Replacement
Content:
This is a replacement for a five-year-old unit (another brand) that gave out after a lot of use.  The "flames" are not as realistic as the one I had, which actually looked like gas logs, but are certainly acceptable, considering the price. It really kicks out the heat.  Makes my 12'x15' basement family room mighty toasty.  After some thought, two things I would do differently:  I would add a thermostat and opt for a remote control,  since I am in a wheelchair and the switches are at the bottom of the unit.  A surprise bonus involving shipping -- I chose standard shipping, expecting delivery in 3-to-5 business days.  It arrived the next day!

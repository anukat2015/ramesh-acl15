Title: Nikon D40x
Content:
Well i read there are alot of menus on this camera but it takes really high quality pictures. Well i had to learn how to use the menus which took several days. I had a hard time figuring out how to use the remote control that i also bought. The remotoe control can only be used when in the remote control shooting mode. I noticed that on the D80 you can just press and shoot. This is alot easier but i dont do alot of personal portraits. The resolution on this camera is fantastic and the lens is very good. The picture quality is really very high quality. The reviews here by others help me select this camera. The reviews helped me choose this camera. I consider this a high end consumer camera but not a professional camera since there is no depth of field feature and other features are buried in menus. I think the intent was consumers will want to point and shoot but if you want to get into being more creative you can do that by getting into the menus. I thought after awhile i could memorize the menuing system and find things pretty well. Summary: I am pleased with the camera. I think once people figure out how to use it and the limitations and features they will be happy with the purchase. I am still learning about features beyond point and shoot and enjoying the experience.

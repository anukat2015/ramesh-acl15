Title: best thing since sliced bread
Content:
Best appliance investment I have ever made. No wasted coffee, no dealing with grounds. Easiest cleanup of any kitchen product I have ever owned. I reasearched these pod makers for almost a year and I'm totally happy with the Keurig. My work day starts at 2:30am and slapping a pod in this and pressing a button just makes my day. I have coffee in less than a minute. No measuring, no mess.

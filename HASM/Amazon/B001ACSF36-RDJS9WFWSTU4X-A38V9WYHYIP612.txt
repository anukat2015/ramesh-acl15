Title: Good Air Conditioner
Content:
Great unit, I bought it to cool off the upstairs hallway and bathroom.  It actually cools off the whole second floor of my home which keeps the downstairs cooler.  Most portables have to be emptied everyday but this unit doesnt need to be emptied for at least a week (I know hard to believe).  I like that it has two intakes on both sides and they are easy to clean. It isnt as heavy as my other portable units.  I didnt have any problems with shipping. I am really happy with the unit, as a matter of fact, I am buying another one today and throwing out the old one that leaks all over my floor!

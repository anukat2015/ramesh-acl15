Title: Very good small heater, great price
Content:
This heater heats up my tiny bathroom really well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't have a handle, which would be nice for moving it around.  As it is, the top gets pretty hot, so you need to move it by the base, which is inconvenient.  Other than that, I'm very happy with this heater.

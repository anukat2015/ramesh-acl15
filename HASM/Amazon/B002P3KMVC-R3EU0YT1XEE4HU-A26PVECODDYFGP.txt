Title: ASUS UL30A-X5, perhaps a high-end netbook, not a notebook
Content:
I had to return this good-looking ASUS UL30A-X5 without trying its many promising features.  The smooth Amazon return procedure gains a star on this review.  Upon inspection, it lacked any kind of an optical drive, DVD or CD.  One expects this situation in a netbook, but not in a notebook.  The irony is that a recovery disk was included!
True, this was my mistake for not investigating more thoroughly before purchase, so I allow another star.  The posted technical specs did not list the type of optical drive, but they also did not warn that it was omitted entirely (common with netbooks).  Hooking an external DVD or CD drive to this unit would defeat the portability aspect entirely.  But since it is obvious that this machine has really good specifications otherwise, and promises extremely long battery life, it deserves another star for a total of three.
Since none of the reviews I read mentioned the lack of a DVD or CD drive, I am posting the review, even though I did not actually use the UL30A-X5, since it may be helpful to others researching their choices more thoroughly than I did.  For those seeking a netbook with muscle, this might be an excellent choice.  For those wanting a notebook complete with optical drive, perhaps look elsewhere.

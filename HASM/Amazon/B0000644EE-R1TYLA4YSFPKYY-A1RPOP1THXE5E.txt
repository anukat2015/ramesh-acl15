Title: Great Coffee Maker -but it breaks after a year
Content:
This is my all-time favorite coffee maker.  It brews fantastic coffee within five minutes, and it's very easy to clean. And since it doesn't use coffee filters, it saves a bit of money in the long run...sort of.
This leads to the two reasons I didn't give this percolator five-stars.  The first is that the clear top is plastic.  Elementary physics/chemistry dictates an almost inevitable outcome when plastic is subjected to a hot liquid over a period of time.  So after about a year the clear top of my percolator became brittle, broke off, rendering the whole thing unusable.  So here I am ordering another one.
Second, it doesn't have an automatic shut off, so you'll need to make sure you unplug it every time you use it. I got into the habit of unplugging the percolator as soon as my coffee finished brewing - so I wouldn't have to remember to unplug it later.  
That withstanding, I really do recommend this coffee maker.  Just remember to unplug it, and expect a year or so of use.

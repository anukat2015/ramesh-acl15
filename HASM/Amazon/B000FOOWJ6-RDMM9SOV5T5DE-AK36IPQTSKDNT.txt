Title: Like it - but
Content:
I ordered this for my husband's birthday.  He has wanted a heater for a while now.  So far we are happy with it's performance but it arrived damaged.  It has a dent in the base which we noticed after it was all put together.  We notified Amazon.com and they immediately shipped us another one.  But the second one also had a dent in the same place.  We again wanted to return it but Amazon.com said it must be something in that lot of heaters and would not send us another.  Instead they gave us $10.00 credit for future use.  We are not happy about that.

Title: Consumer winner
Content:
The Hoover WindTunnel was rated third by consumer reports - behind two Kenmore Progressive models (one that we own).  The fact that this vac is bagless and has the power to pull a four year old vacuum-er across the room (little ones should be supervised around this machine!) speaks volumes - Not to mention that it is HALF the price of a Kenmore Progressive.
Another amazon review I read mentioned a feature was missing - whatever that feature is - we don't miss it.  The only criticism I have is that the attachments are smaller than I'd like - and I accidently bump the suction control button when vacuuming, lowering power all of a sudden.  But the quality of the machine overall outweighs all concerns - this is a good one!  
Plus - it reminds my kids of R2D2.

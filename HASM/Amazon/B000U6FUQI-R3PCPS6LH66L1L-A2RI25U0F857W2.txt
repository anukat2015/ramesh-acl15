Title: Amazing little vac, 2 1/2 yr old LOVES it..
Content:
If you want a little vac, can that can do the job, and get it done fast! This is what you want.. I found mine at Target on clearance for 24.99 and snagged it up... My 2 1/2 year old loves to help with the chores, and this is very easy for him to navigate around, and seriously after meals he runs and gets it, I turn it on, and he cleans up the mess.
not sure what people are saying that it wont pick cherrios or food up, but it does pick that stuff up.. Now it wont pick up wet food items, but thats no biggie, I'd rather not have messy wet stuff inside my vac anyway... 
Its light, its easy to navigate, its fun.. I can get the whole 2k ft house done (all hard wood) in about 15 mins or less... :) 
Ours gets used at least 4 times a day!!

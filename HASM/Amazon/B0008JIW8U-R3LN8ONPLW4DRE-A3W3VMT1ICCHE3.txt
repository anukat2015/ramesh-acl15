Title: Great product!
Content:
My boyfriend and I live in an apt with a kitchen that has very little counter space. This tiny coffee maker is awesome for us. I use it to make hot water for tea and he uses it for coffee. It takes up virtually no space so I don't mind it being on the counter all the time. I have had two of these so far. My boyfriend chipped the pot of the first one... When I looked into replacing the tiny pot (through the mr. coffee co directly) it turns out it costs only a couple bucks more to buy a whole new one (through amazon)! Rather than replace just the pot, I went ahead and ordered another-  so here we are on #2 and I still don't have a single complaint. I saw that some people complained about the clock running slow but I set all my clocks ahead a few minutes and have never noticed it fall behind. Honestly, you only get two cups outta a single brew with this machine, which is cool because I'd be worried about my bf's health if he was drinking more than two cups in a sitting anyway. So if you live alone, have a small space or just like a couple of cups of joe in the am, then this is probably the coffee maker for you.

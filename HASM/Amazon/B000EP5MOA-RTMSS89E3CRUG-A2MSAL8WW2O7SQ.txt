Title: Great Sound
Content:
I love my ipod nano!  It has great sound, it's easy to use and the portability is fabulous!  The downloaded music is put into various categories which makes it easy to satisfy your musical mood.  The shuffle feature is great because it's like listening to the radio except there are no commercials and you are guarenteed to love every selection!  The only problem I have encounted is that the text is small so you may need glasses to pick specfic artists or categories!  It holds approx. 500 songs, less depending on their length or if you have a lot of photos.  I think anyone would love this ipod, especially if you just need a little music any time of day!

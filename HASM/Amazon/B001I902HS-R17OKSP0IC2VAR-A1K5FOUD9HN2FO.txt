Title: Wish I still had my Kenmore
Content:
I had a Kenmore Progressive cannister vac and really, really liked it.  That is, until the motor stopped working.  I did lots and lots of research and decided that this Panasonic vac would be a good replacement.  And while I do think it is a fine vac, it's just not as good as my old Kenmore.  
The cons:
1) cord isn't as long
2) no on-board mini-vac to do quick jobs
3) bags are harder to find in stores
4) I don't think the brush does as good a job as the Kenmore in brushing up the carpet
5) no clean/dirty indicator
6) cannister doesn't swivel or more as freely as the Kenmore
The pros:
1) lighter than the Kenmore
2) cheaper
3) performs equally as good on bare floors
With that being said, I think if I were to do it again, I would have spent the extra money and purchased the Kenmore.  I do a moderate amount of vacuuming every week, and this one performs well under those conditions (hardwoods, carpet and tile in a 3,000 sq.ft. home.)  But it just doesn't have the "extra" features I grew accustomed to with the Kenmore.

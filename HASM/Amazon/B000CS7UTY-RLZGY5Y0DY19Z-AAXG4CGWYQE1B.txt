Title: I love it
Content:
I love my Creative Zen. Controls are easy to use. Software is very user friendly and battery life is great. I have an iPhone and I think sound quality of CZ is better than iPhone. May be iPod have better sound quality. The only downside is the size. It's much bulkier than iPod so it is not that convinient carrying in jeans pocket especially while traveling. But you get used to it.

Title: Piece of Crap!
Content:
After quite a bit of research, I settled on this coffee maker as a gift to my husband.  I would have had better luck randomly selecting one!  It stopped working after the first pot of coffee!  My husband got it to work two more times in the course of a week by some miracle but it's not worth the hassle after a week of this.  The coffee maker looks nice and I paid a decent price but if it doesn't work...all of that is pointless.  My husband called DeLonghi but got nowhere.  We will not purchase another product from them!

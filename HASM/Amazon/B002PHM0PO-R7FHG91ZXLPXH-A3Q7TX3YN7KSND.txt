Title: Just about perfectt!
Content:
I was very impressed with this laptop. I have been a Dell owner in the past, and this is my first Sony VAIO. It is extremely lightweight, runs Win 7 and it's Aero interface perfectly. I was dubious about the fingerprint reader and it's usefulness, but it works pretty well - both to sign on the appropriate user under Windows, as well as offering a fingerprint-protected file area, which I thought was neat. The only slight issue I have, was that my girlfriend has very small fingers - it took a long time to program the PC with each one, as the reader software complained that she didn't swipe long enough. After programming, it worked well though. The wireless N card picked up my dual band Linksys router with no issues at all. I have yet to see if it will do the 6.5 hours on battery as stated. All in all, I am very impressed and would certainly look at VAIOs again.

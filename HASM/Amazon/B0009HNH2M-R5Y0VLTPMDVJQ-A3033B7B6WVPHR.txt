Title: It's just an ok product
Content:
This vacuum has good suction and adjustable "motor torque" control.  The hose is way to short and quite bulky. The so called on board attachments are quite small and I do mean small!!  To the point the look like they belong on a small vehicle vac.  The attachment holder is supposed to mount on the wand but if you do that it makes it hard to go under things such as beds.  It would just always get in the way.  I put velcro on the wand  and the attachment I use most and stuck it to the wand.  I have berber carpet and it seems to do fair job of picking up.

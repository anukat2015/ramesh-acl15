Title: Ask Yourself...
Content:
What you need the cleaner to do? How much you are willing to shell out? It is noisy, but that motor power supplies excellent cleaning. I needed a cleaner that would work very well on tile, wood, and carpeted floors. This cleaner does not disappoint. I also needed a cleaner that would allow me to get underneath and behind heavy furniture. This canister does not disappoint. And I needed it to do those two things for less than $200.00. Well, it does. It may not be well designed, but for what I paid for it, I'm lucky to have a cleaner that cleans well. I just store the tools separately.  So what's the problem?

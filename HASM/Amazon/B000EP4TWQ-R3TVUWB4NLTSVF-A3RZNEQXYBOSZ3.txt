Title: ipod nano makes taking your music with you a lot easier
Content:
ive had my ipod nano for about 5 months now and i love it. ive never had any problems with it, and i take it everywhere i go. it holds up to 1000 songs,pictures,and lyrics. the sound is amazing and the ipod is so easy to use you barely have to read the instructions. i'd recommend an ipod to anyone who wants an mp3 or a way to take your music with you. it also holds up to 24 hrs. worth of battery power, which is gr8 because you can use it for so long without charging it. like i said, gr8 ipod!!!!

Title: Bad Pour, Drippy spout gets more on the counter
Content:
I bought two DeLonghi DCM485s, One a gift and the other for my office. The staff complained, I took it home. The staff were right -- the caraffe is poorly designed. It won't pour efficiently without dripping down the side. If you pour slow enough to keep it from dripping you might as well brew your coffee in the cup -- I wrote the company. They thanked me for my thoughts on the need for redesign but did nothing -- I won't buy another DeLonghi item because of this and feel badly I gave one as a gift -- mine is a nice looking dust collector now.

Title: Good Design, Good Coffee
Content:
This coffee maker has the features we want, is easy to use, makes a good cup of coffee, and looks good on the counter top.
This coffee maker comes with a gold filter.  No more paper filters to deal with.  We just rinse it off when we're done. And we like the taste of the coffee.
This coffee maker allows us to make 12 cups or 1 cup of coffee.  It has a 1-4 cup feature on it so that when we make less coffee, it still tastes good.
This coffee maker has a timer that is easy to set up and use.  We pour in the water, put in the coffee, and the next morning our coffee starts brewing automatically.  
This coffee maker has a nice feature which allows us to set the time for the warmer.  We have it set so that it shuts off after 1 hour.  
This coffee maker looks good on the counter.  We noticed it is the same one used on the set of the tv sitcom "Two And A Half Men".  
In comparison to other coffee makers, I think this one gave us the most features for the money.

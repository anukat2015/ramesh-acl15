Title: when unplugged it does not come back on
Content:
I had this machine for about 3 weeks.  A week ago I unplugged it to move it and when I plugged it back in it would not come on.  Finally the next day I plugged it in again and it came on.  This has happened two more times since.  I called customer service, expecting them to ship me a new one, but they wanted me to take it to an authorized dealer to verifiy the issue.  The machine works great when it is working.  The coffee is hot!.

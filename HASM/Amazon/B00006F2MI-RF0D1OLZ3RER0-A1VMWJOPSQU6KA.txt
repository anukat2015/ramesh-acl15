Title: iff-y design
Content:
purchased this item for my mom in law for christmas and was so excited bec/ it looks so nice.  She has never been able to get the grounds basket out to clean properly bec/ it's stuck!  usually it would lift right out but apparently this is a flawed design as i've read other reviews with the identical complaint...i personally have an older cuisinart grind and brew and have never had a problem with this in 6 years of ownership so i didn't expect an issue with a newer model...

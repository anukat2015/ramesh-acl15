Title: Started out great...
Content:
... but after a few months the player developed charging and connection problems. No matter how I tried plugging the device in (AC or USB), the battery would not take any charge. As for the connection issues, I tried reinstalling the software but the player just would never register on either of my computers. I visited Creative's web site for help (these are common issues for them), but their solutions could not fix the problem. Out of warranty repairs would have cost almost as much as a new mp3 player. So thats what I ended up doing. My Ipod is working great so far.

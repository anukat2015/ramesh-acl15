Title: You think Apple computers are more reliable? Think again!
Content:
I bought this macbook less then a year ago because I love Mac OS. And I still do. All the other reviews are absolutely right: Mac OS X is absolutely brilliant!
Yet, I have serious complaints about the machine itself. First, the part under the wrist is edgy and scratchy and plain unconfortable. And the result of your wrists rubbing the edge of the keyboard plate is the keyboard plate eventually crumbling away! Then the AC adaptor stopped charging and eventually, micro cracks appeared on the bottom chassis. All this in less then a year on a machine that hardly ever moves (I work from home)!!! The machine never fell nor received any shock...
I took the macbook to an apple authorized service center for repair. They agreed to change the keyboard and the adaptor, but say apple does not cover the chassis. The technician at the repair center felt sorry for me and suggested I call apple. I did and they said the cracks on the chassis are not supposed to happen, so they are not covered, so tough luck for me! I asked to be put through to a manager, but the apple support technician bluntly refused saying the procedures where not to be discussed.
In the last 15 years of working in the computer industry, I have used a lot of laptops. I used to carry my laptop around to customer sites and back all the time, yet I've never seen a laptop get micro cracks in the chassis in under a year! And my mac hardly ever moves! You can get a 2Ghz Core 2 Duo PC for half that price, so where is the quality we're supposed to be paying for?
If you want a mac, go for the one with the metal case, the plastic one is just too cheap!

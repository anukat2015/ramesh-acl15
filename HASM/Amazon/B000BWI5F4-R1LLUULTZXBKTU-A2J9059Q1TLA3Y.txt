Title: Design Problems
Content:
I bought the Bosch Compact Plus Hard Floor vac because of the Bosch name and because it is designed not to scratch wood floors.  It works fairly well.  Here are my issues with it:
- if you need a round dust brush, forget it.  It is difficult to understand why Bosch doesn't make them for their canister models, and you can't get one anywhere else that fits.  I'm going to buy a different brand because of this.
- it's very quiet on normal speed, but you will find after a while that you need it on the highest speed.  Even then it seems to miss dust, so I find myself having to go over areas multiple times.
- when you are pulling it along and try to turn, it pops up on its bottom so that you have to re-right it.  A real pain.
- On-off button is sometimes difficult to press
- wish the cord was longer

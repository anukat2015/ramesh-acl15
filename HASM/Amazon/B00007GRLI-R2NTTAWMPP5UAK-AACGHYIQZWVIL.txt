Title: Excellent price for storage
Content:
But as everyone else has stated...you get what you pay for.  When it is working it is a wonderful player for the price.  But it rarely works right.  I haven't had the same problems as everybody else stated (battery life, long indexing time, cutting off for no reason), mine will be playing a song and in the middle of it start up from the middle of another song.  The title won't change on the display, just the song being played.  It will do it a few times and turn the song into a 15 minute remix of all the songs I have on the player.  I like remixes, but this is out of control!!  I have tried downloading the firmware to see if that fixes it...but no luck.  I reccommend forking out a little extra cash and getting a better player.  Too much hassle with this one.

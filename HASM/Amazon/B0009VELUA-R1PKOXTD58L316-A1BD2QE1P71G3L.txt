Title: Love it, Love it
Content:
We read all the reviews and decided to buy this anyway. I thought I would address the complaints on filling the water reservior. Well we have not had a problem at all. I filled a 2 liter soda bottle to the top and filled the unit. Then I bought a $4.83 plastic pitcher and marked a water level on it based on the 2 liter bottle. I keep it right next to the coffee maker and pour it right in. Our to go cup fits right underneath and the coffee stays really hot. Yes we do have to go back to it for refills but the coffee is always hot. It turns off automatically when it is near empty but the coffee remains hot for a while after that. As for cleaning, I remove the filter, filter cup and coffee reservior and clean them to make sure there is no extra liquid left in there to mess up the measurement. We love it. Hopefully we will not have the problems some have had with failure. We previously had a different brand and we were constantly cleaning up the water. This has been a pleasure and takes up a lot less room.

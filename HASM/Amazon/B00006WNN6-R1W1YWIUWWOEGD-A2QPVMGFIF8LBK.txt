Title: Terrible product stay away
Content:
I bought two of these heaters, and they have barely been used for 2 months, on one of them the thermostat does not work anymore.  The fan just runs and runs, and on another, it is very loud with metallic sounds.. which can become quiet annoying.  Their warranty is not worth having since you have to get it to their warranty station and if you don't live near one, you are screwed.  
I would go ahead and spend more for a better unit..

Title: EVERYONE NEEDS ONE AT LEAST.
Content:
I am suprised with this ipod.Overall i did have a junky sansa one where eventually it just broke.It sounds good but its not the best.Coverflow is fine no problem with me.Its so thin that it scares me 8gb is good for me and for many other people why would someone want 3000 songs and fifty videos.I like the way it does not crash like those ipod classics ive heard to many complains.COVERFLOW UPDATE FORGOT TO TELL coverfolw is not annoying any more so update your ipod and have fun.And I was saying well the colors kick but even tho i dont care.enjoy.

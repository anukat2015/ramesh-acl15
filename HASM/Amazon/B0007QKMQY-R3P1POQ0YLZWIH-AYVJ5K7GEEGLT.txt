Title: GREAT Beginner DSLR
Content:
I purchased this camera on a whim, because I thought that I'd like to dabble in photography a bit. I have to say, this is the best 500 bucks I've ever spent. It has launched me into a career that I had no idea I was talented in. 
I WILL say, that I do like the the color quality of the Nikon DSLR better, but for the money, you can't beat the quality you will get with this Rebel. The Nikon DSLRs that I shopped around for were in the 800+ range, and I couldn't afford that, and the Rebel delivers all the quality anyone needs for semi-proffesional and will exceed your expectations if you are looking for a little higher quality of a camera for basic photographs or family snapshots.
I will say, if you are trying to use this for semi-pro to pro photography, invest in a decent lens, because contrary to some opinions, I think the kit lens provided sucks if you need to use it in lower light conditions. There will be much blurring or digital noise involved. 
Also, consider shooting in RAW format for you budding photographers, because then you can go into Photoshop and really see the full potential of a photograph.

For all the basic info on F Stops, Exposure, White Balance, and much more. 
It significantly helped me learn about my camera since I couldn't afford lessons.
Hope this review helped a little!

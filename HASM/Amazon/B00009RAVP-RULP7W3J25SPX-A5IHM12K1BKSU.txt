Title: Great heater for the home office
Content:
I've had this heater for nearly a year.  I keep my home fairly cool (upper 50s or low 60s), so when I am sitting still at my desk, I get cold.  This is a great heater for the home office.  I have never needed to put it on "High."  The low setting is plenty.  I also don't use the oscillating function.  My only complaint is the little ticking timer in the heater, which is mildly annoying.

Title: ipod nano 2nd generation
Content:
Unfortunately, this product froze on my daughter after three weeks of use.  Luckily, she let the battery run out and when she recharged, it unfroze.  We heard this happens often.  Also purchased one last year for my other daughter and we were 24 days too late past the warranty period to get it fixed.  She was away at school and it was exam time so no one did anything with it until after the holidays.  We can't send it anywhere and the Mac stores won't even look at it.  I'm out $189 and she's out an Ipod.  Sad

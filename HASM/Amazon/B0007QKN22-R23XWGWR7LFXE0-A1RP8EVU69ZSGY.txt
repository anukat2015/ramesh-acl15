Title: Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera
Content:
I went from a D60 to this new body, the Rebel XT.  The body itself is a bit flimsy feeling to me, but the IMAGE quality if outstanding. I compared it to the 20D, and decided the Rebel XT was just as good, perhaps even a tad better. I do feel the camera body is a bit small for my hands, so I bought the Opteka Battery Pack Grip (from Amazon), and now the camera feels much more substantial & robust in my hand.
All in all, I think the Rebel XT (350D) is an outstanding camera, especially image quality, and a FANTASTIC value.

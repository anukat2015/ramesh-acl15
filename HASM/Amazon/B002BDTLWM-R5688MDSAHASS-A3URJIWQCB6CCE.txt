Title: Battery problem
Content:
I have the Zen xtra 40gb. It's a great player but kind of heavy and bulky to carry around. So, I bought the Zen 8gb last Christmas. After only 3 months, the player started to bubble up from the inside causing the case to crack open. I believe it's a battery problem. I even tried to scotch tape it but in vain. It went dead. Amazingly, it returned to the normal shape after a few weeks, left on my desk... I'm buying the new 16gb mx.. so hope it won't happen again. :(

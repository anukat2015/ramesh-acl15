Title: Bad deal, bad support
Content:
I was looking for thin and light notebook with extended battery life, my options was to get Asus 10-12 hours battery life or Acer TimeLine 7-8 Battery life, I use the notebook usually for web surfing and remote access to my servers. So the processor power or speed not the same priority as the battery life,
I saw this notebook and HP representative assured me that it will run for 6-7 hours, I check HP website and I found the same, so why don't give it a try.
The machine is nice and light, but I was surprised when I tested the battery and found out that it run for only three hours with all the wireless communications and blue tooth switched off and no applications are running. I did the test several times and I get the same results.
I called HP support and the recommended to replace the battery, so I did. The new one it butter than the old one but still runs for 3.5 hours also without wireless of Bluetooth.
Now for the last three weeks and I'm trying with HP support, with lo luck, each time I speak to support eng, I have to explain the situation to him, and I have to convince him that as per HP this notebook should run for 6-7 hours and I have to send him the links to HP website and finally he tell I will get back to you.
Today I was surprised to know that my support case was closed by HP, simply because they don't have answer to.
So if you're looking for extended battery life to get this machine because simply it will not give you what was announced by HP and also to avoid HP support that the only help you will get "I WILL GET BACK TO YOU"

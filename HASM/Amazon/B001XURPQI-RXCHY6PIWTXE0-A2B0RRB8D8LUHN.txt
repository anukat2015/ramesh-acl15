Title: Best picture and bang for your buck
Content:
Had the Nikon D5000 for a month  and it won't power on. Issues on this. Sending it to Nikon for repair.I  researched  for a small, comparable camera that is similar to Nikon as backup.    Found the T1i  a much better camera. Pictures are vivid than that of Nikon D5000 , just be sure to use only Lens with IS (VR, HSM or DC  features) for Canon doesn't have any built in stabilization in any new camera body.    I paired it to a Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L USM Lens and a new  Sigma 18-250mm HSM lens and couldn't be happier.   My friends are envious including a neighbor that has a BULKY and butt ugly Nikon D90(looks old).    With d T1i's gorgeous 920k LCD lens for live view and superior pictures , I don't even want to touch my antiquated 230k LCD NIkon D5000 again.  The Nikon is going to ebay and my T1i is here to stay. See for yourself . The T1i is even better than the bulkier canon 50d wich has the same CMOS but lacks video.  Just use the right lens. I have been in photography for more than 20 years and can't be happier . Again get a good lens for this  amazing baby. Way to go Canon.

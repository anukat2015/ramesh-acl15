Title: So overhyped.
Content:
I bought the Macbook when it came out this past October. Five months later, I essentially have a $1300 (plus tax) paperweight.
My hard drive crashed while in the care of a "Genius Bar" in an Apple store. It was working when I brought it in because the system preferences never worked. After the geniuses were done, I couldn't even turn it on. I was told that it "coincidentally" deteriorated rapidly while in their care. Since I refuse to pay a huge fee to get my data recovered (and the geniuses apparently can't do it), I've lost all my work, photos, etcetera since October and they couldn't even replace my hard drive because it wasn't in stock.

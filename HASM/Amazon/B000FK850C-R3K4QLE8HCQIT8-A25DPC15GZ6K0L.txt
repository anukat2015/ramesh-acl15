Title: Pretty Good Heater

SPT SH-1508 Tower Ceramic Heater with Ionizer
I purchased this unit after reading most of the spec's and reviews for all of the heaters on Amazon. The intended use for the heater was to warm up the bathroom prior to and after a shower. This unit performs that function pretty well in our reasonably large bathroom which is approximately 350 sq'. In manual mode, this unit will keep the room at about 79*(F) after about 15 to 30 minutes. This is maximum when the adjoining house ambient temp is about 72* on a windless but overcast 50* day outside. I set it to its maximum temperature and just let it blow. The oscillating capability is nice but adds nothing to the maximum temperature or the rate of temperature rise in the room.
The unit is reasonably well made as these types of appliances go. The small footprint is nice. We have it set next to a lounge chair and the chair does not get hot at all. There is little radiated heat except out the front of the unit as intended. The plastic enclosure gets warm.
Despite some of the previous reviews pointing to quick mortality rates, our heater has been in use for a few months operating daily. There have been no problems so far. It is not an industrial/commercial product but with proper care, it should last a long time.
I would have given this a five star rating except for the fact that the "power on" procedure is clumsy and the nice LCD panel is hard to read without bending over and getting close. All in all, I'm happy.

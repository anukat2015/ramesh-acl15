Title: A/C / Humidifier
Content:
We have a "mother in law" type home and our side gets very hot in the FL summer months.
Was not sure if this product was what I was looking for based on the reviews, but I gave it a shot and we love it!
It takes the temp down a lot on our side leaving other side of the house evenly cooled. (and not freezing!)  It does what we wanted it to do. I also love the humidifier as I have very dry eyes and while it is cooling our side of the house, it also humidifies.
The only down side is you can't clean the tray or whatever holds the water. (in a humidifier there is usually a slimy substance at the bottom of tank that must be cleaned out) (maybe this cleans itself?) (I'll keep looking!!)
All in All, We Love It!!

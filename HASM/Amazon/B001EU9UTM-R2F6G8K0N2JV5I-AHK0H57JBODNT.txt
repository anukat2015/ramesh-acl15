Title: Mr Coffe ECMP50 Espresso Maker
Content:
I hesitated to purchase this machine due to other reviewers comments about leakage. But I was so happy with the Mr. Coffee steam espresso maker I decided to take a chance. So far this machine works wonderfully making quite good espresso and crema and doing a wonderful milk frothing/steaming job. I'm very happy with it. Oh..and it's possible the reviewers who experienced "leakage" neglected to empty the tray. That's the only place I've had any water to worry about. If it didn't get emptied it would eventually overflow.

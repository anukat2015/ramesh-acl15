Title: I love this camera
Content:
I love this camera. this is my fist SLR, I moevd form a sony point and shot that was very good, but after you use this there is no way back to point and shot. :)
Don't know why the kit is getting more expensive every day, I just bought another one for my sister and had to buy the body and camera separately and ended up with a better price (yes doesn't make sense)
I bought it with the 18-55mm but ended up changing it for a 18-135mm less expensive than the 18-200mm and very good range...

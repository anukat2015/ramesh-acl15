Title: Good camera
Content:
I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera.  I'm not disappointed in it.  The photo quality is excellent.  The automatic features are very handy and the manual override capability is very good.  I have been a little discouraged by two things; one, the 'info' button is very close to the shutter-release button and several times I've pressed the wrong one and missed a shot, two, although the lens that came with the camera is very nice I will definitely need a more powerful zoom lens.  
So, overall, I would recommend this camera.  I will purchase the 200mm zoom lens and eventually get used to avoiding the 'info' button when I want to press the shutter-release.

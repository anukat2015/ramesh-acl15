Title: This heater is terrible
Content:
I live at 9500 ft elevation, so it gets quite cold in my room at night for the majority of the year.  This heater helps heat the room for about 5 minutes before it shuts itself off and never turns back on.
Quite frustrating to wake up night after night and have the temperature in my room at 55 degrees.
If you need a product to ACTUALLY heat, don't buy this one.  The fan works great, but I could have bought a $10 fan to do that job.

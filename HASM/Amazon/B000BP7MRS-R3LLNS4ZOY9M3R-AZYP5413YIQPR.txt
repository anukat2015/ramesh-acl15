Title: Another winner from Braun
Content:
I have owned various models of Brawn coffee makers for almost 20 years now.  They all have made consistantly good coffee, and have provided good service life.  We have been using the KF590E for about 2 weeks now and the coffee is great!  The coffee maker brews a full pot quickly, and the coffee is hot and flavorful.  The stainless and black design looks great on the counter, even the wife was pleased.
My reasons for 4 vice 5 stars are that E-tonics took 2 full weeks to deliver this coffee maker, and there is an annoying opening at the rear of the cold water tank that forces you to measure no more than 10 cups of cold water prior to filling, otherwise water dribbles on the counter.  Without the hole this maker would easily brew 12 cups, which all of my other Braun's were capable of.  All things considered this coffee maker is a keeper.

Title: Great Room Heater
Content:
I am extremely pleased with this heating unit.  I use it in my sunroom which can be drafty and cold when the temperature drops below 35 outside.  It warms the room nicely and can be used on the "frost' mode to insure that the exposed pipes in an unheated bathroom do not freeze if I am away for awhile.  In that mode, it only activates when the temperature is below 45 degrees in the room--an energy-saving feature.  I recommend this heater with enthusiasm.

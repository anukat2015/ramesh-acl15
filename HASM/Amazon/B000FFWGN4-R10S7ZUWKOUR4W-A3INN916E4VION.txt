Title: Definitely worth the money
Content:
My old Dirt Devil (will never buy again) finally died a painful death, and I got the Lift-Off Revolution Pet to replace it.  My criteria for a vacuum were:  bagless, pet hair brush, attachements, carpet size adjustment and replaceable belt.  Found a surprisingly high amount of vacuums have really low ratings, but this one looked promising.  Was rated high here and elsewhere.  Have to agree, it works great.
Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  To me, 5 stars is perfect, and I could find enough nit-picky things with this vacuum to say it's not perfect.  One of the $500 Dysons would be near 5 stars, but then it's $500.  Got this for $169 at Target (Amazon link), and well worth the money.

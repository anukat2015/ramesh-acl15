Title: Second Pentax - First Digital SLR
Content:
Pentax - name associated with quality photography. This lightweight, easy to use - great quaility build DSLR is a fantastic choice for anyone that is thinking about upgrading from 35mm or just starting out in digital photography- easy menu functions and backward compatable interchangeable lenses.. I reccommend a 1gig Ultra II SD card - for maximum storage and I highly advise rechargeable batteries.

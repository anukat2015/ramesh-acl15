Title: Smells new. Does not get as hot as I anticipated
Content:
We got this to replace our 5 year old sealed oil radiator style heater. This is my preferred style of space heater. There is absolutely no reason to have those dangerous fuel type heaters in this day and age. The fear of fumes and fires-who needs it! When we first started using this it did have an oder that smelled new. It went away after about a week of use on high 8-10 hours a day. No big deal for us. If you are sensitive to odors you may want to open a window or turn it on in the garage first. The first 10-24 hours of use are the most smelly. I was surprised that this did not get as hot as our last heater. It may have something to do with the dispersion of the heat. The majority of the heat exits the top and not the sides. Our old unit radiated from all sides equally. All in all we still like the unit a lot. The timer is sweet and I like the extra safety features like auto off when tipped.
One quick comment on the unpacking of this unit. After you open the top and see the two pieces of foam. Take them off gently and try not to break up the foam. If bits of foam fall in to the unit you should blow them out of the unit or they will stink when they heat up.

Title: PERFECT FOR THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER
Content:
This camera takes exceptional pictures. Very sharp. The Auto Focus is a
life saver. It is light and very easy to handle. It has editing which really comes in handy for the amateur photographer. This camera is perfect for portraits & weddings.I love it!!I tried four other cameras, (the Canon, the Rebel,) and this one is by far the best in picture quality. If you looking for a Amatuer's Camera.....
THIS ONE IS IT!!!

Title: Great heater
Content:
We bought this heater for our son's bedroom, which is typically about 5 degrees colder in the winter than the rest of the house because it is over the garage.  The medium setting does a great job of keeping the room warm at night.  We have not experienced any noises or bad smells like the other reviews mentioned.

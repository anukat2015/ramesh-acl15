Title: Asus G1Gx-A2
Content:
This laptop is incredibly good.  Just from turning it on and viewing the 1080 High Definition LCD screen will make any gamer drool.  It runs Aion on literally the highest settings without any flaws.  The only time the laptop experienced difficulty with the game was after 6 hours of straight play due to it heating up fairly well.  It is uncomparable to other laptops because it trumps them.  Try building the Alienware M17x with the specs of 620GB Hard Drive, 6GB of RAM, nVidia GeForce GTX 260M Video Card with 1 GB of dedicated memory, and an Intel Duo Quad Core 2.0GHz processor and it will run you over $2400.  This laptop was and still amazes me.  Plus it comes with a Razor Copperhead Gaming Mouse and an Asus Laptop Backpack.  If you put the $1800 into this machine you will love it's power and portability.  The only dislike I have about this machine is the sheer power of it is it's double edged sword.  Since it is so powerful, it drains the battery rather quickly.  (Aion on full settings usually drains the battery in an hour and fifteen minutes.)  Another minor annoyance that I don't mind but other people mind is that when the laptop is charging there are LEDs on the left and right side portion of the screen that blink.  Family members complain, but you won't even see them while you're destroying the souls of your enemies on whatever game is blessed enough to run on this machine.  If you buy this, enjoy it.  If not, keep on wishing you did/could because you won't regret the purchase.

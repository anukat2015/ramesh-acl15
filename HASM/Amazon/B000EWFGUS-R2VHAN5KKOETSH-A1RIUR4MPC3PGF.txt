Title: Very average, but reliable coffee maker
Content:
My wife is an avid coffee drinker.  About 2 years ago, we set out to get her a new one.  I had no idea of the poor quality coffee makers out there.  We bought a Kitchenaid thinking it was a reliable brand.  Nope.  Worst product in any category I've ever bought.  That thing would just erupt water and coffee all over the cabinet at completely random times.  We got replacement units from Kichenaid 4 times...and they all had the same issue.  Enough about that.  Long story short...we went through one model / brand after another.  Finally, we did some research on Amazon, found this one to have decent reviews and bought it.
I have nothing good to say about it, but I also have nothing bad to say.  It makes coffee.  Not great coffee, but not bad coffee.  And it doesn't spill water or coffee all over the place!
There's bound to be better coffee makers out there...there has to be!  This is the one we ended up with though..and it's much better than some made by much better brands like Kitchenaid and Cusinart.

Title: In love with photography again
Content:
After my 10D died three and-a-half years ago, I decided to "fast" from photography until I could afford the camera I wanted. The 5D always looked like a great camera, but it was never enough to spur me to commit to the purchase. When the 5D Mark II was announce, my interest was piqued. When the production models started hitting the street, and the reviews started coming in, I gave in. I've been shooting the 5D Mark II for seven months, and I am in love. It delivers the promise of digital photography. It is a nearly perfect balance of quality, features and price. If you shoot in a way that demands the full-frame sensor, it's worth every additional penny over the APS-C sensor cameras. I am enjoying my EF lenses in a way that I have not since I shelved the A2-e and gave up on film. The low-light performance is astonishing. I even had to retire one of my all-time favorite low-end lenses because the sensor image quality showed every defect in the lens! Thanks to the excellent work Canon has done, I am in love with photography again.

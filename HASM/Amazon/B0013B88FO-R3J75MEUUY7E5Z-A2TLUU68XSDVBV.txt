Title: Great
Content:
This was my first MP3 player. I got it in order to view videos and documenteries while riding in train, happy with it.
Id does what is written in description. Performs great at thouse functions. Has no extra, usualy unnececery stuff, and i like this simple and plain.
Simple drug and drup from your PC to your MP3. Copy speed is good. 
Sound quality is good and so is the video. Battery life is good, i see no reason for longer. Churges very fast, it takes about 5 minuts to charge for 1/4 of battery. and in some 15-30 minuts for full better, but deppends how you "speed up" yours battery.  
Strong casing, everything in construction feels strong. Druped it in to the water on the street, works with out problems. 
Works with out a problem at temperatures -18 C, i took it to the mountains. (i pods come back dead from there)
Works on Vista, but had some difficulties with format converting program provided. So i dont use it. Use otehr program. Not a big deal.
One small negative. It churges only from the USB, so there must be a computer near by fro u to cahrge it. might be a problem for travelers to far ends of the world:)
Its a good devise for a reasonable price.

Title: Great value for the money.....
Content:
iPods certainly pay for themselves, especially with all the accessories available to listen to them in your car, home, etc.  At this price point, you can get a lot of music into a very small package that is easily affordable.  I use the Transpod system with mine in the car and the sound quality is better than a direct connection via a cassette system.  I also use it with a Denon stereo and docking station and have been happy with the sound quality.  While the sound of an iPod isn't quite that of a high quality recording, it is still very good.  I'm a musician and I'm happy with how it handles most types of music including classical music.
If you don't have a lot of money to buy albums, this is a good investment because you can use your family members or other people's music.  While I don't condone breaking copyright law, you certainly can "share" music if you want to with friends, relatives, etc.  If you are a young person, perhaps you can load some of dads albums for him and borrow his iPod!  This is a less expensive option than buying a lot of albums yourself.
All iPods are easy to use, but they do have a proprietary format.  If you go this route, you can record CDs no problem.  However, you can't use this as an mp3 player.  You are basically married to getting your music from iTunes or directly from CDs.  Some people find this a disadvantage.  It depends upon your needs.

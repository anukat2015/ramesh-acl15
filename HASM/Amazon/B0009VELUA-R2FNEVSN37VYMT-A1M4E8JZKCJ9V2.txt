Title: Best coffee maker I have ever owned
Content:
I detest the conventional caraffe makers since many of the caraffe's drip or spill when you pour out coffee and then look unsightly because of staining.  This coffee maker obviously doesn't have these problems.
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't had an issue with the coffee maker leaking all over the counter or having burnt coffee after a few hours.  However, I was annoyed at first that the opening for water was so small.  This is a small issue and you forget about it pretty quick.
The real downside about this coffee maker is that when you have house guests, you can't refill coffee at the table.  Instead, you need to bring everyone's cup to the coffee maker.

Title: Great product!
Content:
I bought the Nano for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it! At first she was concerned because she had heard that the quality of sound from the ear buds was not great, but she is quite pleased with them. She even let her dear old dad check them out, and now I want one! She had no problems getting music on to it. Since it charges through the USB port, it makes maintaining it quite simple.

Title: Read the reviews and still purchased the 50D
Content:
I am totally impressed.  It is crisp and super fast.  Very user friendly.  I was worried from the reviews, but after reading what others posted I decided that maybe some of the dissatisfaction was from a glass/lens problem rather than a camera body issue?  I say that humbly, I don't know.  I use L series lenses and I'm thrilled with the upgrade to the 50D.  Like butter.  SMOOTH.  Amazing results.

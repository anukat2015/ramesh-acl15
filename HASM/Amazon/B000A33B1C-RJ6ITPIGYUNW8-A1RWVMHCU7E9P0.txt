Title: Erratic
Content:
I purchased this attractive and elegantly designed room heater last year (2008) based on previous good experience with the brand, and used it for the NYS winter season. It worked fine, heated a 12x15 small living room very well. It overheated once; the safety feature kicked in and shut it off. I followed the directions for "reset" given in the manual, which involves simply unplugging and waiting a couple of hours, but I could not turn it back on. It was not until the next day that I could finally turn it on again. It happened again toward the end of the season, and then I could not turn it back on at all. I tried a month later -- nothing. I tried again over the summer -- nothing. I wrote an email to their customer service asking whether there was something else I should be doing, but their response was delayed, curt, and unhelpful (essentially quoting the manual and telling me to take it to a service center for repair if necessary).
Today (Oct. 15, 2009) I pulled it out of the closet preparatory to taking it to the garage to dispose of it; plugged it in on the off-chance, and it's working fine again!
So I agree with many of the reviews here: it works fine when it works, but I don't trust it to work reliably. I bought a backup Lasko this year, because this is not the DeLonghi brand that I remember from before, which worked reliably year after year. Disappointing; I would not purchase any DeLonghi again and would not recommend it to anyone.

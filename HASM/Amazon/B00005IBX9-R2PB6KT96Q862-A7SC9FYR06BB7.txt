Title: Good coffee but leaks in the long run
Content:
We are on our second Cuisinart DCC-1200 and although the coffee maker brews decent coffee, there is an annoying problem with the drip-stop spring-loaded filter holder leaking on to the warming plate after about a year+ of use.  We had exchanged our first one thinking it was a manufacturer defect, but now that we are on our second the same thing is happening.  This is a nuisance if you are the type who likes to pour a cup of coffee mid-brew... makes a mess!  We like the drip-stop feature so this technicality is a no-go for us.

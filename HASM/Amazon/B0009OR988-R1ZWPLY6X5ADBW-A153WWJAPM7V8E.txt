Title: Great vacuum,except for
Content:
I bought this vacuum after quite a bit of research. I've had several vacuums over my lifetime and all have lasted for several years. One of the reasons I bought this particular vacuum is that it is made in USA. I've bought a lot of tools which were made overseas and they don't last at all. This is a very powerful easy to manuever vacuum and it lives up to all my expectations except for one thing. The cord is very thin and cheesy. I would think a vacuum of this quality would come with a better cord. Although it seems plenty long enough, it's made of a thin vinyl material. Otherwise, I would highly recomend this vacuum.

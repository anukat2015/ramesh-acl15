Title: Great camera but instructions are weak and NO FLASH CARD???!?!?
Content:
This is a great camera, but it is a REAL frustration to spend north of $800 and not have something work out of the box because it has no memory card.  At first I figured I'd lost it so I spend a half hour looking through the garbage before emailing customer service.  They seemed to think some advice on where to buy a flash card would suffice.  The instruction manual is no work of art either
With all that said, it is an excellent camera with an easy interface to the computer.

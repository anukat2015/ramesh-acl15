Title: Poor product, no support whatsoever.
Content:
I couldn't get the program to work correctly.  When it crashed without ability to access anything I installed the recovery discs which I had to pay for and have sent.  About a week's worth of no computer.  The discs wouldn't install at all but then did after using safe mode.  Not everything installed.  But be very careful because if you receive an update it will cause the program to not work again.  Re-install.  HP would do nothing for me.  You write to them, they call, they offer to have you pay for them to look at it. Another week no computer.  They tell you its fixed.  Its not.  They do nothing.  Bought another laptop NOT HP.  Went to our local busiest store, the salesman tells me that 80% of what they have in for repairs is HP.  Great, hundreds of dollars for instant garbage.

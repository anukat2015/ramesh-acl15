Title: Best camera for the money.  Period.
Content:
I had the d40 and upgraded.  The change is extraordinary.  More than I ever imagined.  It's not twice as good.  It's 10x as good.  I looked at the 200 also and for the money it just didn't cut it.  The d80 supported most everything that the 200 did with a lighter body.  Now I have shot the d300.  And it is amazing.  If you have the money and are trying to decide its foolish.  Go with the 300.  But for the price I'll sit right at the 80 and be happy.

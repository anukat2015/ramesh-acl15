Title: HP Pavilion dv2620us, not what cracked up to be
Content:
I bought my HP Pavilion about a year and a half ago.  My wonderful Toshiba had finally died and I read all the reviews and took all the "which laptop is right for me?" quizes and decided this laptop had it all for such a great price...PPHHHOOOEEYYY.  This laptop has 2 design flaws, The plug in cord is next to the disc drive so that unless you turn your computer a certain way, every time you open the disc drive or close it, your electrical cord is in the way.  That is not nearly so annoying as the little slidy sensor on the right of the mouse pad.  It senses the heat or light change from your hand hovering over as you type and jumps the mouse to different positions on the page.  This is VERY frustrating, especially if you have typed quite a bit before checking your work.  You can disable the mouse while typing, but then when you DO want to move your cursor, you have to turn it back on.The battery has never lasted more than 1.5 hours and now lasts 5 minutes.  Since circuit city went under, I am supposed to MAIL it in and wait 4-6 weeks for my replacement.  Also, I do not like VISTA at all, it is annoying, non-compaptible and difficult to work with.  Another problem with this computer is that I have to reset the dispay settings every day...Today I did what I never thought I would do, I bought a MAC...will let you all know, but i have always "been a PC" uptil now.

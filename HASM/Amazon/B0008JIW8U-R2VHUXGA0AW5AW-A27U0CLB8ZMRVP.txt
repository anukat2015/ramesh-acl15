Title: Losing time!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace my old mamoth 12 cup maker. I was moving into a place with less counter space, and find I only drink about 4 cups-worth when I do make coffee, so this seemed to fit the bill. It makes coffee just fine, but the weird thing is that the clock on the front loses about 1-2 minutes per day. After a while this clock gets seriously behind. At first I would readjust it every couple of days, but then I gave up so this thing never reads the correct time. As a result I barely use the delay timer, and thus rarely have coffee before I get on the bus, resulting in a very sour demeanor.

Title: Gem of mp3 players
Content:
I am using the 5x version for about 3 months now, getting regular use out of it. No problem so far. Love the video, photo, extended battery life and clear and crisp screen. Once I had an issue with hanging screen but the problem is gone as soon I used ITunes 'restore' feature.  I have not seen any other product that come close to ipod (software & hardware combination). 
If you looking for a MP3 player, this is it. BYE IT NOW :)

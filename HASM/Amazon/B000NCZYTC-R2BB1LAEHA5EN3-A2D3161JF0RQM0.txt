Title: Great machine! Quick and good coffee.
Content:
I purchased this through Gevalia on one of their special deals.  This machine start the water boiling in 15 seconds or less. It brews coffee at a rate of about 37 seconds per 5 oz. cup.  Not only that, but it tastes great. Much better than my Black and Decker one. Only problem is that it requires number 4 cone filters which cost about 4 times more than the circle ones. 
Very satisfied. If i had purchased a coffee maker online, i probably would have chosen this one as it is cheap too.

Title: What was Apple thinking??
Content:
Hate this product! Earphones are ridiculous, especially if you want to use them in the gym. Controls are too tiny to adjust comfortably. Tried to buy a 2nd generation Ipod shuffle and found out they are no longer available. That is too bad because this flimsy piece of garbage is an unacceptable replacement. Apple, do yourself a favor and bring back the previous shuffle model.

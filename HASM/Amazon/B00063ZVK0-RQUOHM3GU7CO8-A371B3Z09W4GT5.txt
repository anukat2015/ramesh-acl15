Title: Dependable and Efficient Heat
Content:
This heater is excellent! I just use the lcd screen to input the desired temperature and decide on High or Low heat, and the heater does the rest. This heater keeps my bedroom comfortable, and I wouldn't expect it to heat any more than a medium sized bedroom. I like the non drying kind of heat the Vornado's put out, as opposed to, say, the scorching heat of a reflective heater (though it has its purpose). The thermostat is accurate, which is very rare for many of the heaters I have bought in the past. Many times the rotary style thermostats of heaters in this price range fluatuate wildly as to when it will turn on and off. Not so with this digital thermostat. Overall, it's a nice heater for the price and it performs its task beautifully.

Title: My opinion of my new 30 Gb apple Ipod 5.5
Content:
I am very happy with my Ipod purchase. I have had it now just less than a month. It has performed flawlessly. Once I figured out how to operate it it, I have been very pleased. The music playback is superb! I have used it on a road trip and around the house, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone.  I have about 12 hours of music on it, and I plan on putting a couple of videos on it as well.

Title: Everyone loves this machine...
Content:
I recently opened my own business.  My two employees and my wife all love coffee.  I do not.  I bought this to satisfy their cravings, as well as the occasional patient who wants a cup.
I have had this for four months now, and couldn't be happier.  My employees love it, my wife loves it, and my patients love it.  I even have some sales people who call on my office coming by more often so they can grab a cup of coffee.
Everyone comments on how quick and easy this works.  I have had no problems with it.  It isn't all that quiet, but it sits in my office lounge area, so no one really seems to notice.
I have used the Green Mountain Brands, as well as Newmans.  I have even brewed myself some tea - seemed a little bitter, but oh well.  
Works great and keeps all the caffeine addicts happy.  The best purchase I have made for my office, so far...

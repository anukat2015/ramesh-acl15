Title: I Found My Coffee Machine for Life!
Content:
This is the perfect machine.  No mess, no muss.  I fill it with water, I put in my kcup (after picking out my desired brew from infinite choices!) and press a button.  And if I want a second cup, then its freshly made as the first.  It also gives you hot water for tea and soups.  This machine is worth every penny!

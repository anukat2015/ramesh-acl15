Title: The best cofee maker for people on the GO
Content:
Normally, I don't like to review products so quickly, but for this one I felt I needed to.  This is a great invention, and for me, gives me those precious minutes of sleep time in the morning.  
The actual coffee maker is very simplistic in design, which is a good thing. There are no bells and whistles, no timer, no coffee grinder, no clock, but if you want that, get something else, and probably 3 times more expensive.  This thing does one thing, and one thing only.  One cup of good tasting coffee in a flash.
It's the easiest coffee maker I have ever owned.  All you have to do is, drop in about 4 tablespoons of coffee, fill up the reservoir with water a little above the "1" line, and turn it on. In what seems to be about 3 minutes your coffee is ready to go. No real cleanup, just throw the filter away and it's done.  
The good things: Easy cleanup, no cleaning of coffee carafes, makes a great tasting cup quickly. Note:I have yet to try the double maker. 
The bad and these are minor issues: no drip stop mechanism on for the coffee maker. If it's not completely finished and you take your cup out, you will get coffee drips on the base. 
The 2 supplied coffee thermos' are decent but they don't hold the heat all that well and they don't have a no drip tab.  Go to starbucks and get a real one. 
 
It comes with 3 paper #2 filters but I think it should have come with a gold permanent filter.  I bought one and they are about 10$.
Thanks for reading

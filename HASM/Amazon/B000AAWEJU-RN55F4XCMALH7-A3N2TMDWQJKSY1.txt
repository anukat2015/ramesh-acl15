Title: Excellent Vacuum- Major Improvement!
Content:
This little vac is awesome- quiet, efficient, and even nice to look at!  We have a mix of area rugs and wood floors- this vac works great on both.  The other tools are handy for vacuuming under furniture, window sills, etc.  It's a huge improvement over our Hoover upright as far as how much dust it traps and keeps in the bag. I always felt like a lot of dust was escaping our old upright- it was obvious when the sun was shining through the windows!  The Carina doesn't seem to emit much "blow-by" at all.  The cord is plenty long enough for me (that was one of the few negative comments I had seen about this model), and the "reel in" feature is perfect.  I would probably recommend getting the "turbo" tool if you are going to be vacuuming a lot of carpet.

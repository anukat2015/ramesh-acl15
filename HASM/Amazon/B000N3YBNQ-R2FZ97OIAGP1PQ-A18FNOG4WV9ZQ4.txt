Title: I won't buy another one
Content:
I bought this in July of '09, as a replacement for another that I had tried. I should have stuck with my first instinct & went to Sears, Best Buy or Target to check vacuums out hands on.
What's good about it: It's powerful. It gets carpets as well as bare floors clean. It has an automatic winder for the cord. The handle folds down, so it's compact when it gets put away.
What's bad about it: a 15' cord limits the range it will go without looking for another outlet, weight for an item so small, bags that are 1/5 the size of normal and aren't secured.
I'll be buying another vacuum because the bag came off while it was being used & all the dirt & dog hair got into the motor & burned it out.
I would not recommend this item.

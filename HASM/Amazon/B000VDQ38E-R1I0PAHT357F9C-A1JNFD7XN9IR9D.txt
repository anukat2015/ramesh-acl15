Title: A Must-Have for Every Pet Owner
Content:
My husband and I have two dogs and a cat, and pre-Pet Hair Eraser, our home was filled with dog and cat hair. Every time we had people over, we needed to spend hours beforehand vacuuming with our run-of-the-mill vacuum, dusting with Swiffer and using up all those pet hair roller brushes. I considered myself to be pretty clean...after all I vacuumed at least once a week and kept all my animals groomed and brushed, etc. But the pet hair was a problem. We just bought the Pet Hair Eraser today, and the first run through, the canister was about 1/2 filled with cat and dog hair. Amazing, but gross. We did our couch and all of our downstairs. It was incredible how much ick this thing picks up. If you have dogs or cats, I would highly recommend this to you. It was easy to assemble and the attachments are easy to use. I feel like my house is a lot cleaner and that makes me very happy. At first use, it's appalling about how much gunk has built up on your supposedly clean carpet, but it feels great to use the Pet Hair Eraser and get great results. 
PS- The Pet Hair attachment with the rubber on it is FANTASTIC. It got up Phoebe's (cat) hair off of our couch, which was even hard for those sticky rollers to do!

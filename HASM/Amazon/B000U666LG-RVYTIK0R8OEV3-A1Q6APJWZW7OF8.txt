Title: Not what I expected
Content:
I bought this for its digital thermostat because that usually means precise temp control. It even touts its precision on its website -- only a three degree variation from the set temp, instead of the standard six. I was really disappointed to find that instead of a digital readout of my settings, there was a knob; and instead of precise controls,every setting was a range of five degrees or so. The end result is I'm always too hot or too cold when I'm sleeping -- no different from a standard analog heater.

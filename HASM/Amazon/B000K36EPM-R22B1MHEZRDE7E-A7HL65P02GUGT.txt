Title: Worthless out of the box
Content:
I took the coffee maker out of the box and got it set up to run the initial cleaning cycle. I realized almost immediately I wasn't going to be happy with this machine. First off, it has a secondary water filter which is just an obnoxious ploy to get we the consumers to buy more useless and wasteful junk, and secondly, the friggin' place where you put the water is almost impossible to load without spilling. I managed to make two spills using a measuring cup with a spout and a great deal of care. There's no way on earth I could do that at 6:00 a.m. Yes, I know there's a timer, but I'm a busy person and will have lapses and don't want to soak my kitchen on the mornings I have to fill it.
But, none of this matters, because, miracle of miracles, this first rate piece of junk's carafe lid didn't pour properly out of the box. You read that right, this thing was MADE broken, and will be returned and replaced with something not made by Mr. Coffee and, unfortunately, probably not made in the USA. How can I buy locally and support domestic manufacture and save all the trees and my neighbors jobs when our engineering degrees and thoughtful spending on education gets us rubes who design jokes like this? Just kidding, this thing was probably designed by committee in India and manufactured by teens in Guangdong.

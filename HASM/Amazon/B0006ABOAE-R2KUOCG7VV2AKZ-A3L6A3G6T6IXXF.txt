Title: Bad Caraf
Content:
I really liked the way it brews coffee and the expresso machine has worked well and easy to use, however, I had to give this 3 stars because the coffe caraf pours all over the counter and the lid broke.  It has two little buttons that hold it on the caraf and that is not enough.  My husband said I don't care what you buy just get a coffee maker that does not pour all over.  We had a cuisinart before and they are GREAT, but, I wanted a coffee/espresso duo.  We will be purchasing the Krups xp1500.  There will be a review after 6mo for that one.

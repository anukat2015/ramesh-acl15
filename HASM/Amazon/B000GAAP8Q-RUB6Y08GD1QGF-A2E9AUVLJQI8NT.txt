Title: Love my iPod Nano
Content:
This little gadget is quite the improvement over the Sony Walkman of my youth. It makes mundane household chores fun when I pop in the earbuds and pump up the volume. The sound quality is such that I now hear vocals and instruments that I never picked up before. Got lots of songs stored with plenty of room to spare. Can't wait to take it on vacation with me.

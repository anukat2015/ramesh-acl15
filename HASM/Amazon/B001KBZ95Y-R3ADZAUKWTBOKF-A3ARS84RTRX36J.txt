Title: Fine Little Pot
Content:
This is one fine little coffee pot. It was inexpensive, small, yet has all the features. It doesn't take up a lot of counter space, makes just the right amount of coffee, and has all of the features of a bigger pot. The only thing I will say is that it doesn't hold up well to repeated dissection and cleaning. I always like my coffee pots to be perfectly clean and look like brand new. Because this one was so inexpensive, since it doesn't dissect and clean easily, I will just toss it and go buy another one.

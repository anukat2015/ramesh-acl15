Title: Great Coffee Ready When you Wake Up
Content:
I love this coffeemaker.  With the timer, you can have fresh coffee ready when you get up in the morning.  The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours without getting the burnt taste that coffee with burners do.  It makes a very generous 10 cups of coffee, i.e. the cups are larger than most other coffee makers.  No leaks or overflows because the water comes down into the center of the filter.  I highly recommend this coffeemaker.

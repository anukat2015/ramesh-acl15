Title: Great screen size, difficult set up.
Content:
I love my new Zune, that is after I got it running.  It took me forever to set up because I had to download a huge program on a bad internet connection.  It doesn't come with a CD so you have to do the download if you want to add any music.  After I got it running it is great.  The screen size is fabulous and I love the menu's and display.  The Zune software is even great too.  I would definitely by this rather than others but wish it came with a CD to make set up easier.

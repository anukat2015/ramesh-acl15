Title: loving my Rebel
Content:
As a former 35mm user from the mid 70's I took the plunge some years ago and bought a new Nikon digital. It was a great little camera for ease of taking everywhere but I missed being able to somehow do more and finally decided on the Canon Rebel SXi. I knew two people who had them and both loved the camera.
I really don't have alot of tech info to post here as I am just getting my feet wet shooting. But it has sparked my interest again and I am taking it everywhere. I went to our local cemetery on Sunday to shoot the colorful leaves. I am still using auto and not manual and the shots I got were wonderful. I posted them on my facebook account and got kuddos from my friends who are professional photographers.
So far, as someone who used to know her way around a camera, I am impressed that it seems to be easy to figure out how to operate it. I also like the ease in transferring images into my computer.
If I had to buy again I would see no problem in buying this same camera and would do it through Amazon also.

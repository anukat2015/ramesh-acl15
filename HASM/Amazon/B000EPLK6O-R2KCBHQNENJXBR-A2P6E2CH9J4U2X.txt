Title: Good coffee maker, but plastic
Content:
This is a good coffee maker and I am very happy with it.  I'm not sure that it makes coffee taste so good that it warrants the $70 price though.  $40 of the cost probably goes to the shipping from Japan.  
It is VERY easy to use and clean, which is a big plus.  My two concerns are that the maker is plastic and the carafe.  I was deceived by the small picture that makes it look like it is metal/aluminum.  I'm also a little concerned about the glass carafe.  It seems a little thin.  I've broken two in the last year from Mr. Coffee, so I'll have to be very careful with this.  A replacement is probably very expensive as it will also need to be shipped from Japan and it is unique to the maker.  I think most everyone will be pleased with this coffee maker.

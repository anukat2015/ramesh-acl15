Title: Dont use a compact flash card with the evolt 500
Content:
I bought this camera two months ago, and had no problems with it until I went to put the  Compact flash card in one day, and I got an error message from the camera stating a card error.  I then went out and bought an xd card and tried to put that in the second slot that this camera has.  same story.  I have sent this camera back to Olympus, who are now telling me that a tiny pin was bent when putting in the compact flash, and they will NOT cover this under warranty, and they want 250.00 to fix it.  They have yet to explain to me why the xd card does not work either.  So the bottom line is beware putting a compact flash in your camera because if it bends one pin, your 800.00 investment is now useless, and OLYMPUS WILL NOT HONOR THIER OWN WARRANTY, or even entertain the fact that they made a defective unit.  I can now no longer use any of my compact flash cards with this unit for fear of a 250.00 hit everytime I dare to put one in.  THANKS A LOT OYLYMPUS>

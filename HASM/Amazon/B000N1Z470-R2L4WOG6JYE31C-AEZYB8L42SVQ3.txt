Title: Good but not amazing
Content:
This a great space heater, but it's thermostat is a bit off the mark.  It is very quiet, looks good, and very easy to assemble.  The only drawback was that every once in a while I wake up to use the facilities and freeze on my way, then look down to see what it thinks the temperature is and see a happy green light display "72" and I think "this thing is on crack", though this doesn't happen all that often.  Overall a great buy for the price.

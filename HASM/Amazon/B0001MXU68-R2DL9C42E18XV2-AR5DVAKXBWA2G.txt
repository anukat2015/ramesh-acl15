Title: Melitta One To One is over designed/engineered
Content:
At its best the Melitta One To One is only able to brew a demitasse, "8 oz", size cup of coffee/tea.  One wonders why such a size cup from such an "over engineered" coffee/tea maker.  The Melitta One To One designer appears to be a Magna-Cum-Laude graduate of the Rube Goldberg School of Mechanical Engineering.  For anyone with even limited mechanical ability, to use the Melitta One to One, is an exquisite macabre experience of frustration.  Overall valuation 1 out of five.  GOOD LUCK to anyone who owns one.

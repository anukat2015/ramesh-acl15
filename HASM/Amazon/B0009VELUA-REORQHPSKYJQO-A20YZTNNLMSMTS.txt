Title: AVOID - DESIGN FLAW - WILL STOP WORKING
Content:
The on / off switch in these coffee makers is faulty.  When you switch it on the light comes on but the water stays in the resevoir and - no water - no coffee.  So three months after purchase I was left with a broken coffee maker.  After calling cuisinart I would never buy another cuisinart product. I told them the problem and that I knew it was a design flaw because thousands of other people reported the same problem online.  She asked if it was less than 90 days since I bought it because if so under California law I could return it to the store !!!!!.  I was disgusted simply because the store would then have to take the loss for what was a cuisinart design flaw. Cuisinart just wanted to pass the expense and the buck back to the store.  After a long discussion she finally agreed to replace it and told me to return the unit in its box. ( Oh yes, if you buy this keep the original box sitting in your house waiting for it to break down because they insist on you returning it IN THE ORIGINAL BOX. )
I LOVE THE DESIGN , I LOVE THE CONCEPT, I HATE THE FACT IT DOESN'T WORK. SAVE YOURSELVES SOME TROUBLE AND BUY A DIFFERENT COMPANIES MODEL BECAUSE THIS ONE IS FLAWED

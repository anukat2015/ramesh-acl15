Title: Pentax K100D
Content:
I got this body mainly to be able to use my old K-mount Pentax lenses, especially my telephotos. These old lenses don't allow for the auto focus so some adjustments need to be made with the functions menus before the camera will take pictures. Once that's done, they work great. The Shake Reduction is a real asset with a telephoto. One consideration is that the digital format effectively increases the focal length by a factor of 1.5 so a 600mm lens becomes in effect a 900mm lens. Fine for telephoto but it's not so good for wide angle when a 28 mm lens becomes a 42 mm lens.  If you're into wide angle, it's probably better to buy the camera-lens package.

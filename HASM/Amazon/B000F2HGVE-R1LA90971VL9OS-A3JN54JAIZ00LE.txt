Title: DO NOT BUY
Content:
I received this machine as a christmas gift, I like having the option to make expresso/cappacino but it just didn't work well from the start. It leaked water from the bottom and now it has just stopped working.  This is my second Delonghi that stopped working after about 8 months of ownership.

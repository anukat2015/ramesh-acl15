Title: Great product!
Content:
I love the camera, I really hurt paying so much money for a camera but it's all worth it! I used to have a Canon XTI that I really like but this item is top of the line. 
Great product, solid, remember is only good with EF lenses not EF-S. 
HD video is good but if you want to shoot video go buy a G video camera.

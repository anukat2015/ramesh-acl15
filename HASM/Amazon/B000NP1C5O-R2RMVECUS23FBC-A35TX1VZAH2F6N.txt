Title: Just plain awesome!
Content:
I bought this used from someone who was saving up for the Mark IV.  Got it in, and sent it off to Canon to get it serviced etc, Canon support got the machine back w/in 4 days and this was during the Christmas time period.  Upgraded w/ Firmware not yet released, and replaced shutter mechanism.  I do not have the focus issues others had expressed.   
this camera is a computer in your hand as far as all the custom functions, you definately need to pick up a magic lantern or some other guide for this body.  It's definately not for the faint at heart or people afraid to play with the menus on the back of the camera..  I've been shooting a ton of H.S basketball w/ this thing this winter, it has been a LOT of fun!..

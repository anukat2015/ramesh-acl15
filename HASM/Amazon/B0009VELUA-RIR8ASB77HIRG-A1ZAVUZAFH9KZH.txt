Title: Coffee-on-Demand
Content:
I first bought this product 5 years ago when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and was cautioned to not pick up heavy things in order to preserve my finger joints. The first one lasted 5 years, and I was very satisfied with it, so I bought another - this time refurbished for budgetary reasons.
I don't have to pick up a heavy carafe to pour into the cups (I had dropped and broken 3 before getting this). Our "to go" cups don't fit under the spout, so I have a cup with a large handle I use to dispense coffee into and then pour into the "to go" cups. 
I like being able to set it up the night before and set the timer to start the brew as I'm starting to get up. I like the way it holds the temperature for 3-4 hours without making the coffee taste burnt or rancid.
I have noticed I need to add a little more water about 1/2 way through the brewing, as the water container doesn't hold enough water to make a full container of coffee. The clean-up and set-up are easy enough for me to do with my crippled hands, even on "bad" days. 
As I thoroughly research all products I purchase, there was nothing that "bit" me after purchase. I hope this replacement lasts even longer than the original one did!

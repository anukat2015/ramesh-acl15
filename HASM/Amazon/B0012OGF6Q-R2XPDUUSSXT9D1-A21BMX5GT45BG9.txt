Title: Poorly constructed and it will break.
Content:
Nikon DSLRs are starting to fail--lot's of them. Due to Nikon's negligent stance on the issue I am informing consumers to avoid Nikon DSLR's. Unfortunately the D60 winds up with a failing flash, like the D40 and D40X. Users are asked to send the unit away for a vacation. Nikon should be replacing these cameras but instead they are avoiding the problem and frustrating their customers. The amazing power of Nikon technology has been ruined by poor construction and while the cameras work well on paper they are not reliable in real world applications. After being embarrassed on a photo shoot and denied a replacement, I am done with Nikon. At this point Canon's reputation is beating Nikon, so you might do some careful research. You will be lucky to get 6 solid months of reliable use from this disposable and very expensive product. I am selling all my lenses and my broken Nikon for whatever it may be worth.

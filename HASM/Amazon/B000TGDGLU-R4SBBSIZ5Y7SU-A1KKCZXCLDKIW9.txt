Title: excellent
Content:
I live in a completely re modeled pier and beam farm house and sometimes in the winter it can get a little chillier than usual for my climate.  The propane is stinkin' expensive so I bought one of these and it cut my gas bill quite a bit and it didn't suck the electric meter much either.  I will definitely get another one for next winter.

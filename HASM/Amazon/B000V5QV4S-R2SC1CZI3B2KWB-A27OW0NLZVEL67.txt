Title: great pick!
Content:
Great step up from the xti, here are a few things I noticed right off the bat:
more iso options (125, 240, 640, etc)
- imo, way better high iso performance (i coudln't shoot above 800 on my xti without seeing mass noise, Now that same noise iso value is equal to 3200 or "h" iso...then again im using high iso noise reduction setting on, another bonus!)
-much faster shutter speed (does come in handy...and call me a nerd but the shutter sound is more appealing =) )
-LIVE VIEW
-bigger camera, feels more sturdy in your hands
-jump features (can choose, 1, 10, 100, kinda cool...)
-big wheel on back of camera makes it easier to adjust aperture
-sRaw is kinda cool, for shots that you plan on putting on the internet, but not printing...and still wanna use the raw file adjustment in photoshop
-3" LCD screen, i didn't care about size at the time, but after using it, now it's hard to go back to the smaller xti screen.
-water 'protective' battery and cf cartridges...i don't plan on shooting in the rain but nice to know they took the time to implement that just in case.
I think you will enjoy the 40d more than the xti (400) but that money could always go to better lenses, it's up to you what should come first. For me, the 40d made taking pictures more enjoyable. After selling my xti, i didn't have much out of pocket cost, and that money wouldn't have bought me an L lens like I want, so I figured it was a great upgrade for the money.

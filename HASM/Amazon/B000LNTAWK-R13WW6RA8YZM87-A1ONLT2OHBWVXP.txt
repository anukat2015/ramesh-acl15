Title: Can't get much better than this
Content:
I used a Nikon D50 for a couple of years and I did a lot of shooting with a friend who had the D200 so I have had my eye on this camera for a long time. Now that I have it, all I can say is Wow. There are so many features on this camera that it is going to take me a long time to learn them all. I probably won't use many of them though. The 10.2 megapixels offers excellent resolution. Beware that the size of the image files is huge. I bought a 4 gig CompactFlash drive. It also seems to burn through its battery faster than my D50 did. I recommend picking up a spare battery for about $[...]. If you are serious about getting great images then this camera is a great choice. It has a function to lock the mirror in the up position before the shutter opens to minimize camera shake during exposure. One of my favorite features is the back light on the control panel. My D50 didn't have that and I had a hard time viewing its control panel in darker rooms.

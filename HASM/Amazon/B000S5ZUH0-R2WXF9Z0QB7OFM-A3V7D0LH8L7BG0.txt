Title: What's the point??
Content:
I like this PMP a lot. But I am sick of Archos, so returning the thing to W**T a little over a week later. It is 2008 and there is no reason to pay for internet browser. Even it is only $30. Actually, if you want full use if it, you would have to pay a total of $70. May be more. After paying another $20 for a mini dock so I can transfer pictures from my digital camera, I found out that the thing froze when hooked up with my Sandisk card reader. Guess the sandisk transfer data too fast for this PMP.
 I also heard wireless is only passable anyway. Spend some more or same $ and buy a EePC or something.
In all fairness, the screen is sharp, and colors are awesome.  But it is by no mean a good deal.

Title: Economical and Effective
Content:
We have had this heater for a year and a half and primarily use it to heat the bedroom when the main furnace goes to a low setting for the night.  However, because it is so light, we can use it where needed.  This heater is very effective and in the ECO setting at 500 watts it doesn't increase the electric bill so you can notice it.  It's quiet, and the radiant head feels great.  Good heating from both sides except when the room gets near the temperature setting as the ECO setting turns one side off.  Nice heat also comes from the top of the unit.  The new smell when it was new disappeared after a number of uses so there was no problem there either.  Rate it a 5.

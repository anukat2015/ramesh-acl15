Title: Is it wrong to love a vacuum?!
Content:
Wow, I had a very hard time spending this much money for a Vacuum.  It was worth every penny.  I have vacuumed every surface it my house twice!  Save money someplace else.  When you look at how long you have a vacuum then this is money well spent. It moves easy, is super light, the tools give you an option for every surface.  The normal floor tool rotates in a way that lets you get into tiny spots under furniture.  It is so quiet.  Love love love the retractable cord.  I wish all appliances had that feature.  Oh and it's pretty.  I am sold on Miele.

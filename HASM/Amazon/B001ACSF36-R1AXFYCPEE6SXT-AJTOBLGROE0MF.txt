We live in a charming walkup in NYC and at the price we paid, anyone else would expect all the frills. Having been born and raisedin NYC, I knew better. We researched every possible style of window units but could not live with an ugly metal box sticking out of our window.  We eventually decided that portable units would be somewhat more discrete.
We searched high and low and finally settled on this as the best balance in style, quality and performance. Purchasing was a easy and shipping was fast. I was very very impressed once I had unpacked the unit. From a design standpoint, I couldn't have asked for more. The unit sits low and is unobtrusive, very nice lines and overall shape. We had decided on the silver one and were thrilled by the finish of the unit. 
We put it to use on a particularly steamy afternoon and were not disappointed. Installation was not difficult considering I had never used a portable unit before. The living room were we installed it is about 25x18 and faces northhwest so it does catch a good amount of afternoon sun.  The Whynter portable managed to cool our living room in no time at all. We were sitting in a comfortable 70F in less than 20 mins.  The unit itself is heavy but has oversized rear wheels and a very cool pull strap that conceals itself very smartly (you'll see why when you get it).
Thoroughly pleased with this air conditioner from every perspective. I would heartily recommend this to anyone willing to spend a few extra bucks for a superior product.

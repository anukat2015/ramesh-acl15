Title: A GREAT coffee maker.
Content:
My former single cup Melita coffeemaker died after 16 long years of service. Being the only coffee drinker in my household, purchasing models capable of brewing up to 12 cups of coffee seemed like an untenable solution. The Black & Decker DCM7 Cup-At-A-Time Coffeemaker has proven to be a superior replacement.  It is easy to use and clean.  Brewing is quick and the coffee comes out piping hot.  Melita No. 1 cone filters do not need to be trimmed with scissors, unless you use the wire basket filter.  This is not necessary.  I could not recommend this product more.

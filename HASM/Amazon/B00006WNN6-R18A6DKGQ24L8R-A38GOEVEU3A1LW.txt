Title: Don't throw away 15 bucks
Content:
I read the reviews and took a chance. I only used it twice and it no longer works. It shut off during the first use and would not come back on no matter what I tried but the power light was still on. Then after letting it cool and tipped upside down to see where it was made (Puerto Rico?), it began working again. I took a shower and when I got out, it was off again. This time the power LED light was off. Now the unit will not even power on at all.
Next, the manual did not match the dials on the unit. I had to turn the dial to the "fan" mode to get it to blow harder and blow hot air. I think this unit was assembled very poorly.
Last, it really did not heat up my bathroom like I thought. I could only feel it if I was a few feet in front but if I walked more than that away, I was immediately cold again. 
So disappointed and just threw away 15 bucks. I'm not even going to waste my time with the company over that amount. Lesson learned. Don't buy that cheap and I would stay away from this brand.

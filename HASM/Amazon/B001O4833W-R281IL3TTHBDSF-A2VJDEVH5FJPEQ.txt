Title: BUYER BEWARE!!!
Content:
My dad bought 2 of the Gen 1000 units for my family, as we live in New Hampshire, and at the time heating oil prices (and gasoline) were very high.  We thought this would help save money, as the previous year it cost us $600 to $700 a month to heat my 2800 square foot home, at an average heat of 69 during the day and 65 at night.  I will say that the heaters do a great job, are vitually silent, can be easily wheeled around, and do heat from top to bottom.  They don't create absolute comfortable heat all over a room, especially if, like me, you have older windows, or a den that is over a garage.  That being said, my average electricity bill is $180 a month, mostly because I have 6 children, do tons of laundry, vacuum several times a week, bake and cook a lot, etc.  Our bill went up to $350.00 when we used both units, and it took both units to heat my downstairs...we still had to turn the heat on in our upstairs.  I don't believe that we were saving the difference, or $170 a month in heating oil.  I tracked it for 2 months, and I think we only saved about a hundred dollars a month in heating oil.  So it wasn't worth it for us.  Plus, we couldn't return them for a refund because we went past the 60 day cutoff.  
So if you live in a part of the country where the utility rates aren't as high as they are here, it could possibly be worthwhile.  It was an expensive lesson for us...my dad spent $700 on the 2 units, and felt so badly about my light bill that he paid for the difference, and they are both sitting in my formal living room, unplugged.  I supposed I may try to sell them on ebay, or ship them to him and he can give them away.  
Beware, that's all I can say.

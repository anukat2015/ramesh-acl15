Title: Good Buy!
Content:
Very good heater for small rooms(mines a 4x3 sqmeter). Its rotating function is important since this helps to spread the hot air over a wider area and prevents formation of concentrated stagnant dry air that hurts your nose. It also delays the heater from turning off itself too soon, since the heaters thermostat is also moving with the oscillating heater, sampling air from around it. With the earlier Honeywell surround heater i had, i used to blow a portable fan at it so the heater wont turn off fast and only give me a heating range of a few inches around it. But with this Delonghi oscillating thing, i dont have to use that fan blowing at it. It does it by itself. This heater can also work as a very low speed fan. 
You can clean the heater opening its back. The air intake has a filter that can be removed and washed/dusted. Its a good idea to wipe off any dust accumulation at the air intake to get a prolonged use.
I like the Remote control feature a lottt! Now i can adjust the temperature without getting out of my bed. 
Cons: I dont like the always on orange display. It shines in my face at night. Maybe they can make it only light up when u press a key. There is another ON red indicator light and thats enough. 
The heater is very sensitive to flat surfaces and movements. This wont turn on even if plugged, if the bottom is not entirely 0 degrees flat. Thats a good safety feature but its irritating as well.

Title: Worked Great - When it worked
Content:
Bought it in December 2005, worked great for 2 months. Automatic Thermostat was the reason I bought it.  Now it barely puts out any heat.  Bionaire is happy to provide me with a new one... on May 18th, 2006 when they finally get some in stock! What am I supposed to do until then?  Central heating is looking like a good investment right about now...

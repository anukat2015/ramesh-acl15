Title: Dyson DC11 - Great Find!
Content:
We have had our DC11 for three weeks at the time I am writing this.  It replaced a 5 year old top of the line Hoover canister that died.  The Hoover proved to be only average in total satisfaction over the time we had it.  When searching for a new vacuum my top priorities were suction, bag-less and HEPA filtration.  I was willing to sacrifice in other areas for these key features.  I considered most of the top brands but was enticed by the Dyson because it was not only bag-less but also had a lifetime HEPA filter which will save lots of money and waist over the life of the unit.  After getting the DC11 I was immediately impressed with the build quality and suction.  There are lots of smart design features which make using unit a joy.  We have about 50/50 medium pile carpet and hard floors, it cleans each equally well.  My only real complaint is the length of the hose and cord are on the short side.  This is not major and I am happy to live with it and is even less of an issue being that the unit is so light an portable.  The unit is not the most quite on the market but that was not a key selling point for me.  It is much quieter then our old vac but noticeably louder then a Lindhaus.  I highly recommend the DC11 if you are looking for a vacuum with great suction, no bags and lifetime HEPA filters.

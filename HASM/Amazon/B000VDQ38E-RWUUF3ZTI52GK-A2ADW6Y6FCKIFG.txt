Title: Awesome vacuum!
Content:
The Bissell Pet Hair Eraser worked wonders.  We have a dog and a cat.  Our old vacuum worked fine but we wanted to get a bagless.  We vacuumed an area of the livingroom with the old one and it picked up quite a bit of dirt and the green light came on that signifies that the carpet is clean.  We then re-vacuumed with the Bissell Pet Eraser. We got 2 containers full of mainly pet hair that the other vacuum didn't get.  It works awesome! We love it!

Title: Loved it then soooo disappointed.
Content:
Bought this heater for our young daughter's room last winter.  We did use it every night but were sure to shut it off every morning.  The consistant temp. option was great as I'm sure it helped her sleep through the night with no chill/hot fluctuations since she didn't know how to use a blanket yet.  When the weather finally started to warm up we still used the unit to circulate the air as it was a weird summer and didn't warrant the air conditioning much at all but the circulation of air was very nice.  I'd say we used the Vornado slightly more than "average" use.  
Our first snow of 2009 was last weekend....the Vornado was broke.  We turned it to "heat" for the first time this season and the unit would just shut off.  I would have expected this unit to last at least a year!!  Hopefully it's just a lemon as the unit was great when it worked.  We do plan on buying two more and giving them a second chance but I have read other reviews with the same problem....

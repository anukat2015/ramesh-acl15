Title: Simply Amazing
Content:
The D200 is simply amazing. I upgraded as soon as it came out, and I can honestly say that it is the best camera I have ever used. I have been using exclusively Nikon SLR's (and now dSLRs)for over 20 years, and this is absolutely fabulous. It feels right in your hands, it is intuitive and wonderfully engineered with all buttons and controls exactly where you would want them and expect them. A great upgrade from entry-level dSLR's or from your Nikon SLR. A day hasn't passed that I haven't used the camera. Couple this with the Nikon 18-200 VR lens, and you have a dream machine.

Title: BEST MP3 PLAYER EVER
Content:
I got this 10gb ipod for christmas and I am so amazed. This is the best mp3 availible on the market. I'm a PC owner and it works almost flawlessly. Some people have trouble with PC's, but just make sure you have a firewire port, if you don't then you might have to buy an adapter for a USB 2.0. I also recommend downloading iTunes, an excellent program that is much easier to use than musicmatch jukebox, the software that comes with the computer. You can download iTunes from www.apple.com. 10gb of music is more than enough. I really don't see how you would ever need 20gb or 40gb. Note that ipod doesnt support wma format, but who cares. WMA is lower quality anyway. I recommend buying a case for this because the back can get scratched easily. Another thing I like about the iPod is the headphones. They look like regular bud headphones but the bass is great. They are surprisingly loud.      It's very easy to be pleased with the iPod. Its so small and light, it makes all other mp3/cd players look bulky and weak. The iPod is good for people with large cd collections and fast computers, or people who download a lot. Otherwise other mp3 players or cd players are cheaper and better for you. But if you have lots of music and have a computer then the iPod is the best you can get.

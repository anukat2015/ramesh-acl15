Title: Mr. Heater is MY Buddy!
Content:
I purchased a Mr. Heater at first to take the chill off when camping in my horse trailer. Worked great-loved it. Just recently remembered I had it when I was freezing due to no heat in my house. Once again Mr. Heater is my Buddy keeping me warm and he's even safe to have in the house!! As soon as I walk in the door I turn him on HI- then after a couple minutes I turn down to medium. Don't get me wrong- would be nice to have real heat- but Mr. heater is a great help!

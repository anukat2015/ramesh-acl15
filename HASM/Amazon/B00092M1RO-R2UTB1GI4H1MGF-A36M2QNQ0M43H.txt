Title: Audiophile
Content:
The Lyra performs well overall, but has some drawbacks. If you are an Audible Book listener there is no bookmarking feature. Each time you turn on the player you have to "find" your place again. Also the battery cover latch broke when the player was quite new. A rubber band holds the cover in place now.

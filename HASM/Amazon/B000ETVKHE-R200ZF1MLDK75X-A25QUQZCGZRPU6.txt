Title: Impressed...
Content:
I read a lot of reviews for many different MP3 players before purchasing this one.  I was so surprised and impressed when I opened the box, plugged in the player and started uploading music onto it.  I really expected to have to download some software and do some formatting etc. but I didn't have to do anything and it was great.  
As far as functionality goes, it's super easy to use, very small and lightweight and offers lots of fun features I didn't even know it had (like photo and video storage).
My IPod loving boyfriend was a little envious.  I think this is a wonderful mp3 player and have absolutely no complaints.

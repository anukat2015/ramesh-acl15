Title: One Word - Wow!
Content:
The XSi is my first DSLR camera. I have, for many years, been shooting with point-and-shoot (also called "compact") cameras, so I have a lot of experience with point-and-shoot cameras. But the images quality of the XSi simply blew me away! The images captured on the XSi is much, much, much sharper than the ones from a point-and-shoot camera!
If you're looking at the XSi, you're probably a budding photographer like myself. The XSi is, debatably, the best entry-level DSLR camera, next to the Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D.
Highlights
----------
- 18mm - 55mm "Kit" Lens Included
The Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS SLR Lens alone sells for [...]. You have everything you need to get started right away with taking great-looking pictures!
- Phenomenal Images
Alas, I'm unable to show you the images I've captured with the XSi here. But there's alway sample images uploaded by customers of the pictures on the product page. Alternatively, you can go to the Canon site and see for yourself the official sample images.
- Auto Mode
Okay, so you're not quite prepared to tinker with the bells and whistles on the XSi. No matter, there's always a fully "auto" mode (green rectangle on the selection dial) you can fall back on. In this mode, you would be using the XSi just as you would a point-and-shoot camera. The auto mode will stifle your creativity, but it will help you take great pictures nonetheless.
- Incredible Battery Life
I must have taken hundreds of pictures of pictures and the battery indicator bar still shows a full battery capacity (that's with image preview disabled- which is, if I'm not mistaken, the default/factory setting).
In sum, the XSi does everything your point-and-shoot does, only BETTER.
If, like lot of people, you are in a quandary deciding between the T1i and the Xsi/450D. Here are the major improvements of the T1i, at least on paper, over the XSi :
- 15.1 MP Resolution
- Full HD video at 20 Frames Per Second
- ISO range of 100 to 3200
- 920,000 dots VGA monitor
vs. the XSi:
- 12.2 MP Resolution
- No video capability
- ISO range of 100 to 1600
- 230,000 dots VGA monitor
* T1i vs XSi *
- Resolution:  15.1 MP vs. 12.2 MP
When it comes to megapixels (MP), I would have to subscribe to the mantra that megapixels isn't everything. Since the T1i has the same sensor size as the XSi (APS-C size: 22.2 x 14.8mm), a higher number of megapixels would mean more pixels packed into same sensor area.
Keep in mind that as a general rule, the higher number of megapixels that are packed into a given sensor area, the more "noise" (or graniness) will result in a picture taken in low light conditions. (I want to be fair, however, and say that I have not noticed perceptible differences in image quality between the two cameras, even in moderately lit or low light conditions.)
- HD Video
The T1i frame rate is 20 frames per second (fps), which is low compared to even the low-end camcorders, most of which are capable of 30 fps in Full HD. The XSi has no video mode.
- ISO:  3200 vs. 1600
Like they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch. A higher ISO *will* result in more noise in a captured image.  As a rule of thumb, set your ISO to the lowest practicable ISO setting. The lower upper range for the XSi isn't, in my opinion, a big restriction.
- LCD Resolution:  920,000 vs 230,000 dots
There is absolutely no refuting that the LCD on the T1i *is* better than the one on the XSi. The images displayed on the T1i LCD is unquestionably sharper than the images on the XSi LCD.
Based on the above factors, you will have to be the one who ultimately decides what works better for you.
There are, of course, other considerations, the most glaringly obviously of which is - you guessed it - the price. The price of the XSi is has dropped like a rock since I purchased it a couple of months back. If you're on a tight budget, the XSi is definitely the way to go.
---
The image quality from the XSi is simply phenomenal. It is very affordably priced (it has gotten much cheaper than what it sold for originally when it debuted in 2008). If you're on a budget, the XSi is, in my opinion, the best DSLR camera to get.

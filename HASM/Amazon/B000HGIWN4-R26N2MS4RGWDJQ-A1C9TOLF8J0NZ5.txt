Title: User-friendly at the basic level
Content:
The camera comes with a Quick-Start guide that makes it incredibly user friendly for the basics. For the many, many advanced features, though, the user manual is a must!
This camera takes beautifully clear pictures and does a great job with anti-redeye. It's weighted nicely and is useable one-handed, if necessary. Only drawback we've found, thus far, is that it doesn't shoot video.

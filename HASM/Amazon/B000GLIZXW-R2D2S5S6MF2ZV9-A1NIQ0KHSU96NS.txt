Title: More realistic than I thought!
Content:
I am so pleased with my Dimplex Fireplace insert! The flames and burning embers look very real! My family were really impressed when they arrived at my house over Christmas, and saw the warm and cozy fire burning away! The Heat is just perfect, with low setting for continuous steady warming, and the high heat for quicker warmth in mornings and chilly room temps. I have a heater on the other side of my large room, so between the two it keeps a steady warmth throughout. It was easy to put in the firplace- with a tilt of backwall and straighten up, to fit horizontal edges. I took off my glass doors and positioned the screen to cover edges of insert. It looks fantastic.  I wish I would have purchased this years ago when my condo used to smoke up from fires! I reasearched extensively before purchasing this brand and style. I could not recommend a better realistic and heat generating insert!! Love it!

Title: Great MP3 player for the younger set
Content:
Bought this for my two year old granddaughter and she loves it.  Her parents love it, too, since there's no need for headphones and it's not too loud for taking in the car.  She can't quite get the hang of the shake and push method of changing songs but she's happy just letting it play.  Her daddy says that it's easy to download to and they enjoy getting new things for her to listen to.

Title: Best vacuum ever!
Content:
My husband is always saying that he would help more with the vacuuming if we had a nicer vacuum. I was pretty sure he was lying, but I kept an eye out just the same. I stumbled upon this one while comparison shopping for books on amazon. I called my husband at the office and said, "I've found it: the perfect vacuum." (My puny credit card was maxed so I had to get one of his more robust card numbers so I could buy it.) When I read him the description all he said was "Buy it." We bought it and we couldn't have been happier when it arrived. Mind you, neither one of us is good about housework. Forget dust bunnies, with two cats and our poor housecleaning skills (and laziness) we have dust RHINOS. But this vacuum ended all that. It's quiet, it's powerful, it's light, it GLIDES. I love it. I can walk around without slippers again and not worry about getting jabbed in the foot by a piece of kitty litter! And because it's bagless, if I accidentally vacuum up a button or something else along those lines, I can just fish it out of the cannister. Plus, all I have to do now is pick some clutter up off the floor and he looks around and says, "This place needs a vacuum." Then I just get out of his way!

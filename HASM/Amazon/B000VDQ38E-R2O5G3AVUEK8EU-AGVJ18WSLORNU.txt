Title: sorely disappointed
Content:
When it's not clogged, this vacuum works well.  The problem is, the hose clogs constantly, and you have to unscrew the whole hose and remove in order to remove the clog. it's supposed to take care of pet hair, which is why i bought it, but hair is what causes the clogs! i can't even count how many times i have had to do this in the last 4 months since i've owned this vacuum.  I'm not at all happy with this purchase, it's been more trouble than any other vacuum I've ever had.  It only picks up very small, VERY small debris, everything else gets spit out the back.  It does well for pet hair, again when it's not clogged, but since it's always clogged...what's the point?
I can't wait to replace it.

Title: Nikon D90
Content:
I've had this camera for a month now, and I couldn't be happier with it. I have taken a wide variety of photos, and it works great for everything. I was particularly happy with the portraits I have taken with it. I'm not new to photography or SLR cameras, but this is my first DSLR, and it has been easy and fun to learn the controls of the D90. I can't wait to get some more lenses for my D90, so I can do even more with it. This is just a great camera.

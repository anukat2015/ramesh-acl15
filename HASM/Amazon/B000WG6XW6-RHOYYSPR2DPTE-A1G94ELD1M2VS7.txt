Title: Awesome... except...
Content:
Absolutely awesome device... ONLY STUPID THING is that when you randomize your playlist it literally RANDOMIZES your playlist... so instead of just playing it in a random order you have to search through all your songs in random order which is ridiculous... it should keep them alphabetical and play them randomly... just another Microsoft "derrrr" moment. Lets get a patch for that rich people!!!

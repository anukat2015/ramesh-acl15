Title: best one cup at a time coffe maker
Content:
I am a one cup in the morning coffee drinker and found that most of the smaller coffee pots waste a lot of coffee grounds to get a proper flavor. This is absolutely perfect! Although I had to tweak the amount of coffe I added the first few times unit I got it where I wanted it, it has been fabulous. Perfect, hot coffee everytime. Its the most used appliance in my kitchen, I use it for morning coffe and late night tea or hot cider.  It's simply great!

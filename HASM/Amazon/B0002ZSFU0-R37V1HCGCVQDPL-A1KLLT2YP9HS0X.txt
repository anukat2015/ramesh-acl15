Title: This is perfect for me!
Content:
Light weight with good suction; great on bare floors picking up sand and cat hair.  This unit's suction reminds me of my Shop-Vac (checking it at the hose, anyway.)
Maybe not so good on rugs, but works great on floors.
Key Features that I like:
Canister unit follows you around easily;
Canister is light if you need to carry it;
Vacuum head pivots nicely (but I agree, not into crevices); yet,
Tools are on-board and easy to attach;
The hose is quality material--pretty flexible;
Mainly: It has a BAG! Your dirt doesn't blow out of the unit!!

Content:
The 300 dollar Edenpure heater gives the same amount of heat (in BTU's) per watt of electric used as a 20 dollar K-mart electric heater. If your only concern is heat, then don't waste your money on the Edenpure. Of course safety should be a primary concern here and some cheap electric heaters are not very safe. But, ANY electric heater can be unsafe if not used as directed.

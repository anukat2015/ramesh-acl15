Title: An Excellent Option: Updated 1/28/09
Content:
This heater works great! Now I have to give a little disclaimer: I don't have much experience with many different brands or types of space heaters. I do know however that this space heater kept a 20'x25' room at 85 degrees no problem. I should mention that one of the walls in this room is almost entirely windows (which lose heat quickly). 
Pros:
-Comes with remote
-Is quiet (It sounds like a fan on a low setting)
-Heats well
-Space efficient (takes up little room)
-Very lightweight with handle (easy transport)
-Won't start a fire! (I touched the face of it and held my hand to it on high setting, it is warm but not painfully hot. The entire rest of the unit stays so cool it is amazing!)
Cons: 
-Control Panel is only visible from almost directly in front (I thought there was something wrong at first because I couldn't make out anything on it)
-Timer Function: You may only set the timer to go for a certain length of time. I was under the impression you could set the heater to START after a certain time (e.g., to warm up the room before you get home)
Other than that I found that you have to keep it on oscillating to really keep the room warm, otherwise it only heats the area in front of it and continually switches to low power, never getting the entire room to the desired temperature. I went through a ton of these reviews on different heaters and one concern I saw in a bunch of them was that the power cord might not hold up (i.e. cause electrical fire). I got the heater for my girlfriend so I wanted to be sure this wouldn't be a problem- I ran it for over 14 hours straight on the high setting and the cord wasn't even warm, so that put my fears to rest.
I've only owned this thing for about a month so I'll give a durability assessment later. If I don't change my review you can be sure that it hasn't broken down- I will absolutely complain if this thing malfunctions within the next two years.
Update:
So she left it at her parents place over the weekend, and after setting it up they decided they wanted one for themselves. Just another testament to how well it works!

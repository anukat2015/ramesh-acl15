Title: Great little piece of equipement!
Content:
Well, it still amazes me how something this small can have so many features, and contain so much information. This is easy to use! I didn't use the software that came with it, but instead use Windows Media to download the music, and trasnfer it to the Sansa. It's great that you can easily adjust the frequncy response(s) to your own taste. It comes with a removable clip that holds it securely to whatever.
If there's one fault, it's the standard equipement ear buds. They don't sound as good as other standard equip ear buds, that never sound as good as others that are available rather cheaply.

Title: Please do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this product.
Content:
When I heard that Microsoft was launching a product initially I was skeptical.  I had had numerous problems with their other products, but this seemed like it might be different, but alas, another problem riddled product from Microsoft.  
I purchased my Zune from Target and after getting it home, I worked on installing the software and trying to get my PC to recognize the Zune for more than FOUR hours.  This product was clearly not ready for release, but Microsoft was in such a hurry to get this thing out for the Holiday, they rushed it out without proper testing.  
There is nothing redeemable about this product.  From software, to hardware, to their store.  It's just not a good product.  My prediction, this will be pulled from the market within a year.  I returned my Zune and decided to upgrade my iPod to the new 80g model.  I got it home and it was working within 5 minutes.  Save yourself from the headaches, DO NOT buy this product!

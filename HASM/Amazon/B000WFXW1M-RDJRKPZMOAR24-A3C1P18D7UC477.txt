Title: Many great features for the money.
Content:
I brought this laptop for my 13 year old daughter to replace her older one. For the money, you can't beat this (paid 849). Fingerprint reader, 12.1 inch screen that swivels, 4 GB of RAM, Vista 64 bit, touch screen capability and writing tablet all in a light, compact size. Touch screen takes some getting used to but becomes easier with time. More powerful than most desktops. Some drawbacks. Buttons and connectors have a flimsy feel. And it's fast, but not as fast as you would think 4 GB OF RAM would be. However this may change with updates. And, of course, there's always the ever present Vista problems. Not really a reflection on the computer itself; one has to deal with this with any new PC. Otherwise, an impressive array of features for the price. My daughter loves it as well. Highly recommended.

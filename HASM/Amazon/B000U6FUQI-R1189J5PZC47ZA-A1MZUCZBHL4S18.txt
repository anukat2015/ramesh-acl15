Title: Great Value
Content:
I had a chance to use this vacuum at my brother's house before I purchased it- so I knew I loved it. And it is not only so much easier than a broom and dustpan- my 5 year old can do it. And she loves using it. No worries about leaving scuff marks on furniture. It's also great to clean up messes on the carpet w/o having to get out/ plug in the big vac. I absolutely love this product!

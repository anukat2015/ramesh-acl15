Title: Nikon D80 comments
Content:
I am very satisfied with the Nikon D80.  I had four Nikon Nikkor AF lens sitting around from my old Nikon SLR collecting dust.  The lenes integrated seamlessly with this D80.  The D80 has a full range of features which meets my needs.  I am impressed with its AF focus and white balancing systems.  As far as the auto exposure system, nothing can out do an incident light meter in conjunction with manual settings.  The high res images contain enough information for the picture project software to auto optimize them.  Very impressive.  The 18mm - 55mm lens which comes with the D80 works well.  Its very light compared to my Nikkor lenses.  The internals probably contain a lot of plastics.

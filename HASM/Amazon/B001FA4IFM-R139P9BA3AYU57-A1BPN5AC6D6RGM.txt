Title: Thermastat looks neat; doesn't work. One heat setting.
Content:
I expected to like this heater alot. It truly is very quiet, which I love. However, as I used it, I found that the appealing thermastat does not function. Even when the room is 65deg, the heater will only turn on if set at 75 or 80(not 70). It never cycled off, even after the room became uncomfortably warm(over 75deg.) Also, there is only one heat setting, using all 1500watts. Low and high settings affect fan speed only, with just a few watts difference. Returning for refund.

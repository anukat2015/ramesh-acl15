Title: Best heater i've owned so far
Content:
I own 3 vornado heaters, including this one, and they have been the best i've owned by a wide margin.  here's why:
* they fan enough air to mix the room air and maintain a more uniform temperature (their advertising is true in that respect)
* no 'hot toaster zone' in front of the heater, with the rest of the room cold
* it is quiet 
* the thermostat works!  the heater puts out less heat after the room has warmed up
* this heater may appear to take longer to warm up a room for one reason: it is heating up the whole room, not just a small zone immediately surrounding the unit.  
* It does use nearly 1500 watts, which is the maximum a heater can consume to be UL approved on a conventional 15Amp household outlet/circuit.  The only way it puts out less heat is if you account for a more active fan. The reason the heat feels less when you put your hand in front of the unit is due to the larger amound of air being fanned.  The total heat output (heat per cubic foot of air moved X the number of cubic feet of air moved) is the same... just with more even results
for best results: it helps to think of this heater as an 'ambient' heater:
(the following would work for pretty much any heater)
*position the heater in one corner of the room, preferably near the coldest wall... it will suck in the cold air, warm it and push it into the room 
*do not aim the heater toward any sitting area... fanning air always makes it feel cooler (summer fan cooling anyone?) and will give the false impression that the heater is not working... when it is in fact warming the room
* if your heater has a temperature sensitive, variable speed fan: set the fan on high and it will not cycle on/off... it will also mix more air in the room and in doing so, maintain a more uniform temperature
Notes: 
* I typically let my furnace bring the house to 69 degrees (from it's daytime setting of 58) when I get home at night and let the heater keep it at that temp afterwards.  Even in Chicago winters, the furnace usually doesn't come on after the first run (my main floor is an open area, 700 sq. feet, with 7 windows and 2 doors... with only generic insulation... in Chicagoland)
* no space heater is considered 'whole house capable' in winter conditions.  A 1500 Watt unit just cannot put out the BTU's a furnace can.  It is not realistic to expect a space heater to quickly bring a whole house from cold to toasty warm in a short time. 
On the lower side... Vornado seems to have had quality issues with the manufacturing of their heaters..  They've even had a recall on another model of theirs (which i own) due to faulty (read cheap?) solder points 
So my rating for this heater is:
 5  stars based on features and performance
-1  star for reduced trust factor

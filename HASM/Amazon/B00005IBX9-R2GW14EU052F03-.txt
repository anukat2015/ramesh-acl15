Title: A couple of things to think about.
Content:
The coffee maker does look nice and the coffee pot itself is very sturdy and pours real nice.  The coffee was hot and tasted like coffee to me.  The problems I had with the coffee maker was the condensation behind the maker itself.  Your counter does get wet from the lid being opened to the back.  Also I move the coffee maker in the morning to pour the water in and every time you touch the stainless housing, your finger prints are on the metal.  I saw myself constantly wiping them off.  The other thing we noticed is that the clock is not bright at all and we couldn't see what time it was.  It does not have an LED clock and is very hard to read the time.  We use the clock a lot in the morning before work and it just didn't cut it. Just a couple things I wanted to mention for review because I didn't see anyone else mention these things and they were a big factor to me. Makes good coffee but I was tired of cleaning.

Title: IT WORKS!!!
Content:
For the last 20 years I've tried various vacuums from Hoover, Eureka, Orek and even a used Electrolux. Some were uprights, other were canister. None of them was half as good as what was advertised...until now!
This baby has power! In fact, it'll practically drag you across the room..no kidding! Though not silent, it'll be the quietest vacuum you've ever owned. WHen we first ran it over the carpets the amount of dirt it picked up sounded like no one had vacuumed for years. Hard floors are easily cleaned as well.
Not exactly the cheapest model out there, but I doubt you'll get anything better spending more money. 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND

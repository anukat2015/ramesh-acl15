Title: Vornado is AMAZING
Content:
We bought this as a second heater for the upstairs room in our Cape Cod (it is 30X14 with an A-frame ceiling). But this thing is so amazing that we don't need the other heater! This one keeps the ENTIRE room warm and EVENLY heated. We are continually amazed at the job it does. It is also so very quiet!
We have been so happy with the purchase we bought another one for our sons room. (Also worthy of being mentioned is that the unit doesn't get hot so you don't have concerns about children getting burned!

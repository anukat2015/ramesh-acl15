Title: Such a great Value!
Content:
The other reviews will tell you all you need to know, so I'll try to fit in some other stuff.  It's an amazing all-around performer.  
It's great in low-light, but I did notice something.  About six of the pixels are "hot" meaning they show up either red or some other noticeable color in certain photos... primarily in low-light situations with the aperture wide-open.  It's super-easy to fix using Photoshop or some other editing program, so not a big deal.
Battery life is amazing.  I've left it sitting for months and still had enough for a regular day of shooting (a couple hundred photos) with plenty of battery to spare.  In fact, I bought an extra battery just in case, but I've never had to use it.
On the D200, the rubber grips become loose over time.  Nikon USA sells the rubber grips separately for about thirty bucks (1f998-074 Grip)(1f99-073 Front)(1f99-075 Rear).  I bought my D200 used and the first thing I wanted to do was replace the grips... but after using it a bit and noticing that the looseness didn't affect usage at all, I decided to save the grips for when I sold the camera. 
10.2 Megapixels are all I need... I never thought that the resolution needed to be better.  My opinion might change if I used any of my photos in a format bigger than 8 x 10.
My camera has about 30,000 shutter actuations, and the shutter is supposed to last 100,000 or more.  I'll update this if the shutter should fail before then.
So, in short, I love this camera and I won't upgrade until Nikon comes out with something that is significantly better!

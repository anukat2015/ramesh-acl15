Title: Died less than 30 days after warranty expired
Content:
My experience with a Supentown Portable AC Unit is very similar to what 'Thorion (Rome, NY)' reported.  I purchased a WA-1200E in June 2006 and it died last week (end of June 2007).  This unit was lightly used (less than 10 hours per week during warm months only) .  I contacted their support staff and, although they were prompt to reply, they indicated that the unit was out of warranty and that nothing was covered.  They gave me the option of shipping the unit (85 lbs) at my own expense back to their warehouse in CA.  They would then determine what part(s) failed and charge me for the replacement parts, labor and return shipping.  Their other suggestion / advice was to take it to a local repair shop of my choice and have them find out the problem...then order the replacement parts from them.  Either way....TERRIBLE! For a costly unit like this it should last way longer than 12 1/2 months.  DO NOT BUY!!!

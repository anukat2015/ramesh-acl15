Title: Hoover Bagless Canister Works Great on Tile Floors
Content:
We just traded in our Sear canister of many years for a Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Canister.  It is compact, lighter weight than our old one, and works great on our Saltillo tile floors.  The dust cup is easy to clean, which is good because we have five animals in the house.  I really like the extra wide, lightweight special hard floor attachment.
Only bad thing is that the upholstery brush that came with the machine is dinky.  I saved and use my old one from the Sears vacuum.  It fits on the hose just fine.  Also, I cannot really speak about the basic rug vacuum attachment, since I have not used it.  Dont have any rugs now. (Simplify, simplify).
Overall, we think this machine is great!

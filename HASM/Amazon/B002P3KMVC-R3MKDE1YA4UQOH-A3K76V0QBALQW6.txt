Title: ASUS-Great Company!
Content:
I bought the ASUS UL30A-X5 when it came out at the end of October. So, I been using it for over a month now. WOW! What a great laptop. This is my first personal laptop and I'm very pleased. I used my brother's laptop before purchasing this one. It runs great, and it's very quiet. I love how light it is. I'm a college student and I take it to class almost every day and it doesn't add that much weight to my already heavy backpack. 
Pros:
*Battery life: I don't need to worry about ever carrying the power cord with me if it's fully charged or even at 50%.
*Keyboard: The chiclet keyboard is so comfortable to use.
*Multi-Touch Touchpad comes in handy.
*LED Screen: Perfect size, not too small not too big
*Doesn't burn my legs when I use it for long periods of time.
*Overall a "sexy" laptop. I love the aluminum and the material around the keyboard has blue sparkles on it (not gaudy at all). This is subtle, but it's enough to separate it from all other plain boring laptops. 
Cons:
*Fingerprints magnet: I don't see this as a major problem. I carry a microfiber cloth in my laptop bag, so it's always a quick fix.
*The webcam sucks. Luckily I don't use webcams often and I already have a great one by Logitech.
I also purchased the ASUS USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive SDRW-08D1S-U to go along with the laptop. It's very slick and goes great with the laptop.
I'm a new fan of ASUS!

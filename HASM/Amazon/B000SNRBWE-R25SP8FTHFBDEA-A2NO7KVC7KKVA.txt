Title: Big Disappointment
Content:
Although the Panasonic vacuums come highly rated by consumer magazines, this model would not shut off unless unplugged. I notice that another buyer commented on this same defect. Likewise, when I contacted the retailer, they directed me to Panasonic. Panasonic didn't have a repair facility in Ohio and required me to send my vacuum to a shop in Pennsylvania for repair. It has been weeks and I've heard nothing from the repair shop. Buy large or expensive items from a nearby store. Secondly, I've purchased similar vacuums from Kenmore(Sears) and I've had no problems with them.

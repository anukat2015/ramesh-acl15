Title: Ahhh Coffee waiting for me
Content:
I have fallen in love with this coffee maker. I wake up ever morning to a hot pot of coffee waiting for me.  I have read other reviews saying that they didn't really like this pot due to the pour lip and something about the coffee basket.  I love the wide spout that the craft has and have never had any problems with this coffee maker.  The only thing that I would have to say I don't like about it is that it has an auto shut off after two hours.  I am a stay at home mom and drink coffee all morning so I do have to turn it back on half way through my morning.  That's just me though.  Easy to program and set up, it only took me around 2 minutes to pull it out of the package and get completely set up.  I would recommend!

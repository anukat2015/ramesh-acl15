Title: Good but not great
Content:
We have been using this coffee machine for about 3 months.  The pros are it is programmable - and programming is easy, it has a thermal carafe - so we can't forget to turn off the machine, the coffee brew taste good - assuming you're using good coffee, and the carafe is non drip.  The cons are the 5 beeps to signal the end of the brew cycle are loud and annoying - and the beep can't be toggled off, after 2 cups poured, it is not easy to pour from the carafe, and the coffee, once brewed, is not super hot.  Overall, we're happy with this machine for the price but we would not buy it again.

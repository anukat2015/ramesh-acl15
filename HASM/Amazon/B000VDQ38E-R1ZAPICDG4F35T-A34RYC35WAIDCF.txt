Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
I was shopping for a good vacuum that does well and for the price, this is fantastic! I have 3 cats that shed  A LOT of hair and this picks it right up! I love the attatchments and the suction power is great.  It is very easy to empty, just switch the latch and it pops out.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone who has pets or those who want a powerful vacuum! Very Pleased!

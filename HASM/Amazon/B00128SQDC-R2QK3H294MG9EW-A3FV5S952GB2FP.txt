Title: Great!  Just get it and get after it...... and then get even better!
Content:
A great camera with logical user features to make it easy just to get it, use quick start up, and get after it!  Then, take the time to read the well organized manual and it gets even better.  This camera is loaded with features, and is now well beyond the D40, has many features that appear to be improved from the D70.  This one also is well beyond the Canon series at a similar price point, based on camparisons I've done with a 'Canon friend.'
The Nikon D80 feels well balanced and solid.  The package lens quality is better than average, but is the one thing that someone may wish to 'upgrade' at some point - more just to add focal length.  However, given the package price, its a great deal and makes getting great shots in most scenrios easy right out of the box.
Downloading is simple and fast, and with the SD card you have the option to save to standard formats (JPEG) or with a larger SD card you can save 'raw' and/or JPEG which gives maximum editing capability.
Don't forget, you will need to buy an SD card (I'd recommend no less than 1 GB).  And, although battery life has been great so far, if you plan on a full weekend of nature or action shooting, you may wish to order a backup for the very specific battery required.

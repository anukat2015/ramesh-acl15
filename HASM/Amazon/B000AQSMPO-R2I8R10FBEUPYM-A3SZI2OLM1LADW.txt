Title: Too much coffee?
Content:
I have tried a senseo almost a year ago and had to return it as the quality of coffee was horrible. I really liked Keurig. There is no cleaning, amazing coffee choice and the coffee is pretty good. 
B60 has 3 cup sizes and I use the medium and then without changing the pod do another medium brew to another cup for my iced coffee mix. 
The only down side is, since it is extremely easy to make coffee, it requres real will power to avoid drinking too much.

Title: Good quality for the money
Content:
This is a good product for a small space. It is a bit loud, but not any louder than the fan on my fireplace insert (wood burning stove). The noise is easy to get used to. The heat output is very good even on the lower setting, and takes little or no time to start heating when it clicks on. The thermostat controll is easy to set, and I feel safer about fire risk with that and the automatic safety shut-off. I have a small bedroom that I am using this for, and it works perfectly. I don't think this would be that good for bigger rooms.

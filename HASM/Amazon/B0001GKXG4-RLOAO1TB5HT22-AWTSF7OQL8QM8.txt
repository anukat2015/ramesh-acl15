Title: Great Heater
Content:
I Purchased a #L5600 heater from  Air & Water, instead model #3VU36
was sent. I checked the specs on the heater, which indicated
19,000 BTU's, for the 3VU36. It looks like Dayton upgraded the 3VU36 model
from 15,000 BTU's to 19,000 BTU's. Last winter I used two vornado
heaters to heat my garage. Please note that if you use two
1500 watt 110 volt heaters (in my case Vornado's) on the same circuit you
will probably have problems with the circuit breaker tripping. Also my electrical sub panel would get hot. I have also used a Reddy Heat 35,000 BTU propane heater to heat my garage.The reddy Heat propane heater is almost as loud as a Jet Engine. OK so on one hand the Dayton heater is noisier than a Vornado, and does not heat as fast as a propane heater. On the other hand the Dayton heater is quiter than a propane heater,(and does not burn up oxygen like a propane heater) and will heat an area faster than two Vornado's (which by the way, two heaters will beat up on your houses electrical wiring). All in all I am very Happy with the performance of my Dayton heater, my sub panel now gets warm instead of hot. Air circulation is better than a Vornado, and my Dayton heater heats my garage ALMOST as fast as a Propane heater. I would recommend this heater.

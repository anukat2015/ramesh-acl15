Title: Incredible Value!
Content:
This is really a combination of Netbook & Notebook. I had one of the first really good netbooks for about a year before this model came out and I couldn't wait to switch. In addition to all the pluses mentioned by Adam, biggest improvement for me was the FULL-SIZED keyboard, with the right SHIFT key in the right place! Second biggest draw was the 11.6 widescreen high resolution screen which makes both web browsing and video viewing on airplanes a dream. Great battery life, good processor, Windows 7, 2GB memory, larger hard drive and low weight all combine to make this the travel/study laptop to get.

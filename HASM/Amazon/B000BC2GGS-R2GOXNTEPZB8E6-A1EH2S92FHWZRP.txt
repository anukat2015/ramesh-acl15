Title: Warms the room, but gets very hot and is fairly large
Content:
This does a good job warming a room, but be careful because it gets very hot to the touch.  Also, the unit itself is larger than it looks in the picture.  Be sure to check out the dimensions before ordering.  It has held up well over lots of use.  Also, beware that it does suck a lot of energy.

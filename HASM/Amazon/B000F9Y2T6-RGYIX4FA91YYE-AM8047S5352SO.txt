Title: Pretty Good product
Content:
This product is pretty good for floor cleaning. It does not come with much cleaner so make sure to order or buy a bottle of the type you need. The only drawback is there are no rotating scrubbers when it uses the wet cleaner side. I have a friend with a different brand whos has the scrubbers and she says it picks up a lot. On the plyus side it is great to never have to whip out the old broom, dust pan and mop!

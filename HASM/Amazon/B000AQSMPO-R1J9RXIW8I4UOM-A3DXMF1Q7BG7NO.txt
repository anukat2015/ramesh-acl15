Title: Coffee isn't the strongest, but...
Content:
...that's not always a bad thing.  I used to make my coffee too strong, and that much caffeine isn't good for anyone.  Some claim the coffee is weak, but after drinking it for a few weeks, I prefer it to the sludge I used to make.  Also, because of the novelty of it, I find I'm using it more often and not stopping at Starbucks as often.  The only downsides are that I can't use the used grounds for landscaping anymore and the reusable filter is hard to clean by hand (cleans great in the dishwasher, but I only have a full load every few days).
On a side note, I purchased this for $129.99, and it came with 90 K-cups, not just 18, and the reusable filter.  Great deal.

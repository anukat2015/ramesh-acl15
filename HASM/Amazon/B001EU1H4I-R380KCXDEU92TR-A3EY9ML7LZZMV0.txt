Title: Measure space carefully
Content:
Make sure that you measure the space from the counter to the cabinet carefully. B&D has changed the dimensions of their latest SpaceMaker and, because my cabinets are fairly low, there just isn't enough cleaning space below the appliance, so I had to return it without having a chance to use it.  I have happily owned two SpaceMakers in the last 20 years, replacing the first only because it was so stained. They were well-made and lasted forever.  I want to replace this second one because it, too, is badly stained although it still works great.  Major disappointment that the replacement didn't fit the space available; however, after reading the reviews here, I think I'm better off keeping my old model or buying another brand. The new model sounds poorly made.  What a shame that B&D didn't stick with the old model forever with same dimensions and quality.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

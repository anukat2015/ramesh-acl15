Title: HP Pavilion DV2620US 14.1" Notebook PC
Content:
On second week of owning this notebook, the log-in failed. I had to reboot it. Regenerating process using DVD disk had problem. Wasted several disks before was able to make 2 back-up disks. Still have one more disk to do. Hope this OK. Average performance. No comparison to Apple Macbook. Never had a problem with Macbook 13". Apple performance is superior. Online security is very good.

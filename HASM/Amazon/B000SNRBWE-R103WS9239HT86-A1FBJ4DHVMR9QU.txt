Title: Great Vacuum but broken shut-off after 10-12 uses
Content:
As pointed out by other reviewers, the shut-off switch breaks easily. I don't think I've used it more than 10-12 times and now I have to unplug it to turn it off. Other than this completely unacceptable fault, the vacuum works very well, with good suction and easy maneuverability. I would have given it 5 stars if I weren't about to pack it up for the repair shop. As it is, maybe 3 stars is overly generous.

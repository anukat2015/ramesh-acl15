Title: Buyer Beware!!!!!!
Content:
Cannot stand upto a Bernese Mountain Dog, he sheds a massive amount of hair i have had this vacuum about a month and i am on my third belt and the roller is busted....wont turn any longer.  Being the owner of 3 dogs i know how to maintain my vacuum, i clean my filters regularly and clean the roller every other time i use the vacuum and this vacuum is a piece of junk my cheap hoover stood upto my dogs and kids better than this one.  i bought this because they advertise it will hold upto to dogs that shed, and even have a Bernese in the advetisements for it...but 3 belts in a month is rediculous!!!  I'm sorry save your money.  also when using the tools they should have a way to shut off the roller, just a suggestion.

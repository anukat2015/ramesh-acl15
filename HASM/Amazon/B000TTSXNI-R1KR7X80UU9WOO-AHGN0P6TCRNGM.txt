Title: Great heater in slim design
Content:
This is the second Lasko ceramic tower we have owned.  Smooth even heat that is distributed in an oscellating mode for total room warmth or stationary to force warm air into a specific space.  We use one in our master bath which is more like a barn than a room, and the other in our motor coach to heat via the electrical hookup at the parking space during cool weather, and to supplement the two propane furnaces in the coach during really cold weather.  Saving expensive propane is always a good idea.

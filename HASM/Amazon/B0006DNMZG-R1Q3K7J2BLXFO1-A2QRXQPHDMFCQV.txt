Title: Heats Well, Inexpensive, Looks Nice;  but Noisy
Content:
This fan/convection heater is inexpensive, easy to use with well placed controls, is only 6 lbs and easy to carry from room to room, looks nice, and works  well. Downsides of this heater are that it is relatively noisy and there is no handle to carry it.

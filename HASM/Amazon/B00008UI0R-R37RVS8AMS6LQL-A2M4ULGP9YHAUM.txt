Title: Hoover Windtunnel Canister
Content:
I ordered this sweeper after much research on the best rated canister vacuums. I love shopping at Amazon and was sure I would like this sweeper. It is sturdy and well built with the exception of the hand held tools such as the dusting brush and crevice tool. These looked like they would not last. 
I seldom send back anything I order, but I did this purchase. I did not think it was a bad vacuum but was not for people who want a simple canister to use for "dust bunnies" and cat hair on tile floors. Too big heavy and awkward for that. I may not have paid enough attention to the dimensions in the listing, if in fact there was any.
I was wanting to continue using my wonderful upright (Eureka Smart Vac) for the carpets, so I did not really need the power driven hose attachments. Just make sure this is the right vacuum for your purposes.

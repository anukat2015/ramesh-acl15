Title: the perfect portable
Content:
This ultraportable rocks.  I have a nice laptop core2duo 15.4" with Blu-ray, etc...but I started to realize I needed portability and battery life for use on the road and around the house.
Why this laptop is "perfect" for me on the go and around the house off the plug:
1.  Small form: barely over an inch at the thickest, just under 3.1 lbs. 
2.  Battery life: this is huge.  The screen seems very bright.   I am using it surfing the web on wifi and after about an hour and a half it still says over 9 hours of battery life.  On the plane...I watch over 3 hours of high quality DVD rips (over 1 gig an hour mpeg4), plus an hour of full screen flash based "Peggle Nights"...and still over 40% battery left.  
3.  Keyboard is full sized (other than directional keys), touchpad multi works great
4.  Real premium windows 7.
5.  HDMI, 1080p, full uncompressed multichannel PCM audio.  It actually plays bluray quality clips...no netbook outside of an ion based can get close to this
6.  A solid dual core CULV processor.  Each core can easily best an Atom 1.6Ghz
7.  Real specs...3 GB RAM, 320GB HDD.
8.  Screen.  Awesome...no more scrolling when surfing or incompatible apps, a real usable res.
Cons.
1.  No optical drive.  this is expected on something this small and light like a netbook, but it is still a con
2.  Cost.  All these real specs, win7, comes at a premium over a netbook.  Still it does what other ultraportables do at a third their cost.
3.  Processor trounces Atom based, but forget real games on it, it still uses integrated gfx...while they are optimized for video, they don't push polygons.
4.  Case lid.  While it makes a good picture, the glossy finish of the lid is a fingerprint magnet.  I am looking into a few options to reduce prints (car wax, skins, etc)
Overall...I can't be more happy I went for it.  The only other option that was a contender was the HP mini 311.  It also has the same type of 11.6 higher rez screen, HDMI with 1080p processing.  But it falls down because while base is $400, that is without bluetooth, without wireless N, with only 1GB RAM, 160GB HDD, winXP, and considerably lower battery life (30-40%), AND a far inferior atom N270.  Really no contest...

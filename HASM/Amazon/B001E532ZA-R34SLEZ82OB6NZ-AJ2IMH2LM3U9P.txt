Title: Love it!
Content:
I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend (who has recently developed a love of coffee and was tired of spending $3 a day at Starbucks!).  The smell of coffee makes me nauseous when I'm feeling sick so I was excited to find this product as traditional coffee makers spread the smell through the whole house.  
We both love the machine.  I bought hot cocoa t-discs myself and the cocoa is rich and creamy - I will enjoy it this winter!  I bought him a variety of coffee/coffee mix drinks and he loves them all thus far!  I look forward to trying the chai tea latte.  The coffee this machine makes is strong but you definitely can not smell it if you are not right by the machine.
As other reviewers have said, it takes under a minute from start to finish to make your beverage - much more practical for people in a rush than typical coffee makers.  You fill the water up, turn it on, put in a t-disc, and it takes maybe 30 seconds to cycle through each disc.  Before you know it you have a delicious drink that rivals the coffee shops for half the price.  Our machine has never dripped once the cycle is done so we've had no clean-up (other than the mug we drank from!).  Now we will just have to buy flavor syrup so we can really be our own baristas :)

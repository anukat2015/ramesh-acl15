Title: You can't understand until you own one
Content:
My wife and I regard ourselves as pretty tidy people but we were both shocked at what this vacuum cleaner pulled out of our carpets.  We had to stop and empty the container after completing only small sections.  Hopefully this won't continue as this first pass pulled it all up but clearly our previous vacuums were not doing the job.  Worth every penny we spent!

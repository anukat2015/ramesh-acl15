Title: Nikon's Best
Content:
This is one of the best Digital SLR cameras ever built. 
Pros -
Full Frame
Full Bokah effect from lenses with shallow DOF
Solid Magnesium alloy construction
Nice weight
Large review/preview screen/Main back LCD
Weather sealed
Huge eyepiece view
Steady and accurate light meter
Fast
Excellent color depth
Excellent latitude
Superb light sensitivity
Ultra low noise
Very fast auto focus - even with old lenses without the SWM
Perfect for sports, fast action and slow paced art photography
Handy info status on main back LCD
Awesome extra features:
    Able to take single photos in a periodic setting - possible to string such photos together in video editing software to make time lapse video.
    9 brackets (4 under 1 on 4 over)- great for HDR photography - when combined with previous setting, the camera shoots a bracket of 9 every time it fires.
Cons -
Focusing screen grid is not a complete grid
Unselected focusing points are not visible
Focus points do not extend out of the DX crop frame.
Not able to see light meter in top LCD

Title: Not bad at all--and very convenient
Content:
I ordered this from the Melitta website without reading some of the reviews on here (or realizing that Amazon sold it). Then I found them, and got nervous.
But this machine does exactly what it says it will: brew a single cup of coffee using pods. No, the quality is not what you would get at a gourmet coffee shop--then again, neither is my pot at home when I make it with a regular machine, even when I grind my own beans. I needed something for work that would produce a minimum hassle and mess, and One: One does just that. Once you get the hang of using it (the right amount of water, which pour is better for the cup you're using, etc.) it's clean, convenient, and provides that caffeine rush just as effectively as a regular pot. I'm eager to try www.podhead.com's varieties, which I understand are of better quality, but even the Mellita pods aren't bad at all.
I reread some of these reviews, and I just don't understand them. Were people really expecting the best cup of coffee they'd ever drunk out of a pod machine? For my part, the best cup of coffee I've ever had was in Italy, and I know I'm not repeating that experience with this machine. But my needs are different at 7:30am in the morning when I arrive at work, and One: One answers them.

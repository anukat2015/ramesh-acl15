Title: Best little coffeemaker in Florida
Content:
My husband and I wore out a Black and Decker pod coffeemaker and were disappointed that we did not find a replacement in a department store. We purchased another brand and it was awful. I then went online and found this model and it is wonderful. I highly recommend this product and ordering and delivery were a snap.

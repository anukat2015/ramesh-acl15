Title: everything is great except the battery life
Content:
first i should start by saying the iPod Mini is my first MP3 player. i've never used any other MP3 players, so i'm not sure how the iPod is in comparison. i chose the iPod after doing a lot of online research. i had friends that had iPods and loved them. so i finally decided on a mini. 
it took a while to set up and configure, but i read through the manual and everything was fine. i do like the iTunes software, and found it pretty easy to import my CDs. the design is nice and fairly simple to navigate. the mini holds about 1000 songs which is fine if you have a moderately sized music collection. i have about 300 songs so far and will probably get another 500 to fit on there. 
however, after charging the iPod overnight, i discovered that i only get about 2 hours of battery life. what i was not aware of is that the iPod drains the battery even when it's turned off. after a few days the battery is completely drained, even if i only listen to it for an hour total. i tried to find out if this was normal, and found nothing of help on their support website (which was pretty difficult to navigate). i finally went to an Apple store and left it with them overnight. they said that it got the average amount of battery life when they ran it and that it's normal for it to use up the battery even when it's turned off. 
so overall, i gave the iPod 3 stars because it's a good product if you don't need a lot of battery life. i would recommend considering other options before deciding on an iPod.

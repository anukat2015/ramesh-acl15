Title: Not good for small bedroom
Content:
The heater does provide adequate heat (one star for living up to its name), and the tip switch works (one more star for that feature working). Not suitable for quiet environment. Thermostat sucks.
My 10+ year old space heater started to rattle this winter, loud enough to wake me up at night. So I need a replacement. This DeLonghi will not work out. The thermostat control is just inadequate. The unit requires too much manual input (did I mention I'm trying to sleep at night?). In auto mode, I have to crank up the thermostat to get it to start. To maintain room temperature, the heating element cycles between low and high. I thought the little unit was having a seizure it was clicking sooo fast. Lowering the thermostat back down below the desired temp did not turn off the heat. I had to switch modes to turn off the heat, cool down, then crank up the thermostat again when I felt a chill. It will turn off by itself when the ambient room temp is above the thermostat setting, but that won't happen until spring.
Smaller nits to pic: I choose this Delonghi because it is the same size and has similar features of my old unit. I expected some wind noise, but it is louder than I am used to. The all-seeing-eye makes a nice night light but not the easiest display to read. The unit BEEPS each time you press the remote. The tone is just about right for a fire alarm, only a little softer. On the topic of fire and space heaters, the tip switch is one of my criteria for choosing this unit, and it works. The safety tips included in the packaging say to keep the heater 3ft from obstructions. Difficult to do since the cord is &lt;2.5ft long (I will follow the adjacent safety tip to not use an extension cord).

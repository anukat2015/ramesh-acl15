Title: Great heater for single rooms, and more!
Content:
I love this heater and am thinking about getting another for another room.  It heats my apartment bedroom well (though not TOO hot, which works for me), and even into the next room over.  It's reasonably priced and very light weight.  It also has a great 'white noise' sound that I love when sleeping.  I would highly recommend this little heater to anyone.

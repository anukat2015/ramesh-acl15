Title: Cool thin player
Content:
I own both the Ipod nano and Sansa fuze.
The IPod nano is much more cool, it's much more exclusive and packed with alot more features. 
The only two things that little bit annoy me are the cyclic control, which it a bit hard to control, the other is that the IPod cannot be turned off, just set to standby mode so the battery is used all the time.

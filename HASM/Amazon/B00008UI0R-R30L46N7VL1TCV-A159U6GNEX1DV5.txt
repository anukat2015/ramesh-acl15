Title: Better than Kirby Vacuum
Content:
A Kirby salesman came to our house and did his little demonstration thing. During the demonstration, he poured sand in my carpet to show how superior his vacuum was compared to ours. Yeah it sucked out a lot of the sand, but after he left, we found that there was still quite a bit of sand still in our carpet. Our vacuum cleaner was just about dead so we decided to get a new one. After a lot of research, we chose this Hoover vacuum cleaner. It was able to suck up all the sand that the Kirby had left behind. I highly recommend this vacuum cleaner.

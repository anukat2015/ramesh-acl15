Title: Improved
Content:
I have an earlier model 8 gig xfi which I like alot but ran out of space on. The new 32 gig starts up faster shuts down faster and charges faster...the only fault is I like the older headphones better because they are clearer on the highs. I'm not into rap so I don't need so much thumpa thumpa on the bass. Clarity is what I want. Some of my jpegs won't show up on the screen though they show up in thumbnails
. weird but not that important to me.

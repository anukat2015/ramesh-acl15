Title: DeLonghi Heater
Content:
Good heater for a home that already has central heat.  I use it for some of my bed rooms which are always colder then rest of the house.  I keep it on the lowest heat setting and it keeps the room just at the right temperature.  The timer is easy to use and reliable, but I had to read the directions to use it.

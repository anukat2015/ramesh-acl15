Title: Great introductory DSLR
Content:
This was my first SLR since converting to digital.  I previously had a 35mm Canon Rebel that I loved although it was rather basic and old, then I had a Canon Powershot which was good.  I was hesitant to switch to a digital SLR because I thought the Powershot was all that I would ever need; after all my old Rebel film camera was lacking in features and took average shots - so a point-and-shoot digital was better.  Why would I need anything more than a point-and-shoot?  
I was so wrong.  The Canon Rebel XSi is an awesome camera, loaded with useful features that are easy to figure out.  The Rebel line has come a long way in innovation since going digital, and the control and quality of a DSLR cannot be touched with a point-and-shoot.  I still like my point-and-shoot because I can keep it in my pocket for easy traveling; but the XSi is my main camera.
If you are new to digital SLRs, or new to SLRs, or new to photography; or upgrading from a point-and-shoot -- this is the camera for you.  If you have the extra money for the T1i, it's a little better with video; but the XSi is still great for photography.  
Check out the manual by Ben Long for a great set of instructions on how to use this camera.  It took me about a month of steady shooting to really understand it, but now it's like second nature.  I highly recommend this camera.

Title: Warm or Toasty - Take ur Pick
Content:
Got this off of friday sale on amazon for Thirty bucks plus ten for shipping. It looks great & works just as well. As someone mentioned earlier, it has two heat setting High(1500 watts) & low(750 watts), & then there's the thermostat which looks like the analog tuning dial for old radios. Its all part of the "retro" look. Not bad at all. We'll see how many winters it pulls through before it breaks...

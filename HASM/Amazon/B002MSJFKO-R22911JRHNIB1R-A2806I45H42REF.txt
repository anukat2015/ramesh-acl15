Title: Tassimo
Content:
I enjoy using the Tassimo, and I think it's a great product. The convenience of making one cup of coffee at a time works well for me since I am the only coffee drinker in the house.  However, I think the coffee that I brew in my coffee maker has a richer fuller taste than what is brewed by the Tassimo.  I suppose that should be expected since I grind the beans myself before making the coffee. The Tassimo brewed coffee is good and certainly drinkable so I'm not going to rate it any less. I would like to say for those who enjoy coffee house lattes and such, don't expect to get the exact same results. You can make a decent tasty drink, but it's not going to taste like something you can get from a coffee shop.  So be wary of those who say it tastes just like Starbucks or Panera Bread because it doesn't. 
My only gripe about the Tassimo is that it doesn't have a reusable filter like Keurig does.  The reusable filters allow you to use your own coffee or tea rather than the prefilled pods.  If I had been in the market to buy a single cup brewer, I probably would have selected the Keurig so I would be able to use my own coffee and tea which would be less expensive than buying the pods.  
Overall, the Tassimo is a good product that's convenient, fun to use, and makes a pretty good cup of coffee. There are a variety of discs to use with the Tassimo, including tea and hot chocolate, but if you want to use your own coffee, right now the Tassimo does not have a reusable filter so that's something to consider. If that's not an issue for you, then the Tassimo is the way to go.

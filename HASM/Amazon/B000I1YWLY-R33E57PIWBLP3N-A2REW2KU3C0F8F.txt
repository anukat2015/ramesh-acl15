Title: great vacuum
Content:
we had a big Eureka upright vacuum for the carpeted area plus Bissel Flip-it for hardwood floor plus a small vacuum for tiny areas. I got so tired of keeping multiple vacuums and all of them smelled bad after vacuuming, especially eureka vacuum.
This Electrolux vacuum is so far very satisfactory with both types of flooring. On the hard floors, however, I still use the carpet setting since bare floor setting doesn't have good enough suction - it doesn't even pickup hairs. Carpet setting is a bit noisier but it works well.
As other users commented, the handle turns clockwise only, but i think it is intentionally designed so. if it turned clockwise and counterclockwise, the handle might feel too flimsy, especially with the heavy head.
The dust bin is really easy to empty, leaves no odor after vacuuming, and its overall appearance is pleasant.
It requires as much space as upright vacuums (or slightly more space) because of the big head. That's why it's four stars, not five.

Title: Happiness is a good vacuum.
Content:
I had been through about three $100-$150 vacuums and finally had it. We broke down and bought this machine and, oh, I am in love. As a rule, vacuuming is not something for one to get excited about, but this changes everything! We have all hardwood floors and plenty of dogs-- a combination to make most tidy people shudder. We put a HEPA filter in and we are good to go. I don't keep the attachments on-board, as I agree with the previous reviewer that it is slightly awkward. But you will not be disappointed with the power. The varying degrees of suction are great, and the vacuum is very, very maneuverable. I can reach under and around almost everything in the house! I was also blown away by how quiet this machine is! This little blue bug is a great addition to our family. We've had it for just over a year now and it shows no signs of slowing down.

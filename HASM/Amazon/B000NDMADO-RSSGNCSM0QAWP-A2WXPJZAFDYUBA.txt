Title: this is from the guy's point of view
Content:
Ok my wife came home with this,It looked crazy but it works extremely well .I love the bagless design which is very easy to empty,no more wasted money on bags you throw out.Great suction use it on hardwood with dog hair The only complaint i have is the cord length is way to short and the cord recoil is so slow it makes me want to design a upgrade kit.

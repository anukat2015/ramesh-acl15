Title: Perfect Product!
Content:
I have had my 8GB iPod for nearly a year.  I was one of the first to purchase it last year when it first came out.
This product is perfect.  You hardly ever have to charge it, it's durable (flash memory), and it is easy to use.  If you've never used and iPod or iTunes, of course there is going to be a learning curve as with anything, but once you understand the general functions, you are set.
There is a reason Apple has a substantial market share over any other MP3, and that is because it is the best all around player available.

Title: awesome machine
Content:
Really pleasing device. 
Previously I owned Dell inspiron laptop with windows, thus I'm not an experienced user of Mac based systems. But basing on my experience I can say that I've made the right choice to buy Macbook.
Solid aluminium casing is pretty much resistant to scratches.  It boots and turns off in a matter of seconds.  Applications run perfectly.  I haven't tested it on video games though, but it plays dvds perfectly. The battery allows to work for 5 hours easily without power socket available. The glossy display and lighted up keyboard allow to work both in direct sunlight and in the dark rooms.  However I've found that despite of all the pros I've listed - sometimes the casing gets slightly overheated.
Anyway - the best laptop that one can buy I think.

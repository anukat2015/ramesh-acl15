Title: 2 strikes and Cuisinart's out
Content:
I first bought the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew and I could write a 200 page dissertation on why it's more trouble than it's worth, so just trust me on that.  Then, I bought the DCC-2000 and as soon as I poured the water in the reservoir it started leaking all over my kitchen counter.  The water ran right through it.  I checked it out thoroughly to see if I had done something wrong, but I hadn't.  
Is there a company in the world today that cares about quality anymore?  I think Cuisinart should pay me for the time I've wasted trying out their defective products.  Their quality control staff are obviously asleep at the wheel and if they don't wake up soon, the competition's going to take over.
Anyway, I'm moving on and will NEVER buy another Cuisinart product.

Title: Great computer!!!!!
Content:
I had an acer that had a HORRIBLE battery life and eventually, after only 2 years of use, it stopped charging altogether.  The charger that came with the computer no longer gave the computer life so I had to borrow a friends charger (he once had an Acer that did the exact same thing), which may I add was too big to fit into my computer so I had to hold it in with a pen propping it up.  Needless to say, when the charger crapped out last week, I decided it was time for a new computer.
I was really hesitant at first to get another Acer, but after doing tonssssssssss of research and consulting with my engineer sister, we decided this computer was the way to go.  I ordered it on [...] (very fast shipping and got it for under $600), and it came a day before it was scheduled it in mint condition.  I still need to play around with it more to see all it can do, but so far I LOVE it.  It has this really sleek look to it, veryyyyy light, and the keyboard is awesome.  I thought the one panel click bar would be a pain, but it's not at all.  As for the battery life, so far I've seen it last 6 hours but thats when the battery wasn't charged a complete 100%.  I'm confident I can get at least 7, if not more.  It's great.  The internet is giving me some issues but that's just a matter of fixing the settings.
So far so good, but it's only been a day.  I'll comment more in a few months :)

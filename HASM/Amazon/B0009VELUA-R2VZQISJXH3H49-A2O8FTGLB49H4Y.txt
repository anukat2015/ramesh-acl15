Title: Best coffee I've ever had at home
Content:
This unit is great.  Very sleek look and no carafe (we fill the water reservoir with the built in hose from the faucet).  This is the third coffee maker I've bought this year - I don't know why but the result is the best coffee we've ever had at home.

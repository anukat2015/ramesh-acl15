Title: Keurig B70 Review
Content:
I loved the coffee maker when I got it but after two weeks it wouldn't work correctly which was annoying - I called customer service and they sent we another one which took a week and a half to get.  So far it has been three weeks and it is working fine.  I love the idea of having coffee on demand and so many coffee choices is great.  Still haven't decided which brand and roast I like the best.  I plan to use this coffee maker for a long time to come as long as there are no more problems.  It is really great.

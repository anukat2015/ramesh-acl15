Title: Nice MAC!
Content:
What can I say...it's a MAC. There is nothing left to say! Best PC on the planet and you get such wonderful stuff with it. Yes, a little pricey but I would take this over a PC any day of the week or year! It is a solid performer and can always count on it not to crash like the PC's always do. So, I guess it is like to ole' saying..."You get what you pay for!"

Title: A suitcase essential for coffee drinking travelers
Content:
This compact coffeemaker has been the best gift I ever gave my husband! He cannot function in the mornings without his cup of joe which can pose a BIG problem while traveling as most of the hotels we stay at (Vegas, Europe, S. America) do not supply a coffeemaker in the room. In order to save myself from his morning coffee withdrawals while on the road, I set off to find a coffeemaker that was compact, sturdy and would deliver a good cup of java. Voila! We've had this unit for over 3 years now; have taken it all around the globe with us (using a converter) and it still performs flawlessly. It is an amazingly compact, all-inclusive machine. Just add your favorite ground coffee (hubs brings his favorite-Kona!)and water. It does take a bit of time to brew a cup of coffee, but hubby uses this time to shower and his coffee is waiting for him when he's done and clean-up is as simple as dumping the grinds and rinsing everything out. At first, I thought the machine a bit pricey, but the money and time saved in not hitting up a Starbucks, etc. is well worth the cost, especially if you travel as often as he does.  These days, the suitecases don't leave the house without the Brisk Brew!  He tells me all the time how it's the best gift I ever gave him!  Thank You Zelco!

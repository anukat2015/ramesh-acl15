Title: Better off making something yourself
Content:
As a few others have mentioned, this is made with incredibly cheap, thin plastic. It is thinner and more flexible than most plastic packaging material. The picture I saw shows white plastic, but it is actually clear. Given that it is so light/flexible/flimsy, the air from my vent blows it out of position. I'll have to find something to set on top of it like other people have (the problem is that I'm not sure how much clearance I'll have under the furniture). It would definitely be nice to have something a little more rigid. I'm sure you could make a better product yourself and not spend any more money...

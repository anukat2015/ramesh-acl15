Title: Long-term assessment
Content:
Five years after I bought it, my Zoji has just about died. Bad news for me. Good news for you because it inspired me to write about how well it performed over the long-term. 
Basically, I've been pleased with the Zoji. I'd go so far as to say it was the best coffee maker I ever owned -- if also the priciest. I experienced the overflowing problem a few times. Not enough to make me regret buying it. And that was the sum total of all the problems I encountered up until this week, when first the "auto" button broke, then the thing stopped perking about midway through the cycle. 
Now I need a new one, but considering that my first lasted five years -- I think it's a fair bet my replacement will also be a Zoji.

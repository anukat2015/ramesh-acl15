Title: No VT support in processor- No XP Mode Function
Content:
I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate ($238 upgrade) so I could use the XP mode to use an xp business software that I have. Then I found out the processor in this machine does not support something call Virtual Technology and won't run the XP mode without it. So I'm screwed with a $1000 computer that isn't much use to me and now I have to buy another one. I hope this saves someone a headache.

Title: Fabulous Computer, Short Battery
Content:
This comptuter had everything I was looking for.
I needed a work computer with Windows Vista Business.  I needed at least 2GHz dual-core.  I wanted HDMI output to connect to my Samsung 52" TV.  I wanted discreet graphics for games.  I wanted Bluetooth.  I wanted a large hard drive.  I wanted at least 3GB Ram.
I've played Guild Wars on this computer and the framerate is around 40 fps.  I've played WoW on this computer and the framerate can go as low as 30 fps, but can go as high as 60 fps, very much playable.  The speakers are not very loud, so I recommend headphones for games or for watching DVD's.
The computer is thin and easily stuffed into my laptop backpack.  The power brick is not too big, but not very small either.
I would have prefered a 13" or 14" screen for portability, but this screen is way nice.  The screen is bright and clear, although the glossy surface makes watching DVD's less nice.
The battery doen't last long.  On high performance mode, the battery lasts 1.5 hours or so.  On power saver mode, it lasts 2 hours.
The trashware that came with the computer can be a chore to unistall, so I just left it all there, eating my hard drive space and probably consuming processing power.

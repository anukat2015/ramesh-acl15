Title: Cute but Worthless
Content:
My problem was the same as Carla's problem stated here. The laptop is gorgeous, but it makes loud noises, frequently freezes on me, followed by unplanned restarts. After each weird restart is the same black screen saying "no operating system recognized". And I had to unplug everything including the battery to reset it. The last time that happened, the machine is no longer able to restart!!! I read Carla's problem and didn't believe that would happen to me! Obviously I was WRONG!!!  Luckily I'm still able to return it!

Title: overall satisfaction
Content:
This camera has much potential as a powerful photographic tool.  However, It will probably not produce exceptional results in the hands of someone who does not desire to take the time to learn its capabilities, or would simply be more comfortable with a point and shoot experience.  
My previous camera, a Canon G2 (point and shoot), still produces great output even today,  but I never truly "enjoyed" the experience of using it, because it did not handle comfortably and "intuitively" as a "photographic tool".  My wife (the non-photographer) uses the G2 now!  Myself, I find the E510 is much more enjoyable for me in this regard--to the extent that it has totally rekindled my interest in photography.
Before settling on the E510, I considered the Canon 30D (with a 28-135mm lens), but returned it after a week because I was not happy with the relatively hefty price, quality issues and range of this lens  (Actually, the 30D is a superb camera in its own rite... however, harnessing its potential really requires quite an investment in "L" glass.)
For me the E510 with its 2 superb kit lenses, was a perfect fit for what I was looking for, covering an excellent range of effective 28-300mm with quality optics. No regrets buying this.
Incidentally, I also picked up a used E330 camera body soon after, and it perfectly complements the E510.
 
I know the E520 is now the latest, greatest.... but the E510 is still the best deal going!

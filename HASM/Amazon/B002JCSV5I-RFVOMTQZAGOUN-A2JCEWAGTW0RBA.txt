Title: Brilliant for a beginner like myself
Content:
I purchased this camera because I love photography and for a while now have dreamed of getting an DSLR.  I have played around with a lot of the features on my various Point and Shoots but I wanted something better.  After going through a lot of reviews, questioning my friends with DSLRs already and knowing my budget I purchased the D3000.  I was not disappointed.  I am no expert on photography and am frequently going to webpages and books to see the best ideas for certain shot situations but this camera so far has done very well for me.  It gives you everything you would need to start out and learn the functions.  it is slightly lighter than a lot of the the other SLRs out there which for me is excellent since I travel a decent amount and makes carrying it around these places no problem.   One thing I thought could have been better is the Guide mode which pretty much is an easier way to use the different settings (portrait, landscape, etc) modes on your camera, and if you don't know how to set the camera in these modes already then maybe you should either do some more reading, or go back to your point and shoot (which also has some of these functions).  Overall I am so far extremely happy with this camera and can't wait for my upcoming trips to really push the envelope of the types of shots I take.

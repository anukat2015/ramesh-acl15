Title: If you don't care about HEPA filter - quite good choice
Content:
Ok. I reported &quot;air flow problem through power cord attachment place&quot; to the Bissell and that's what they gave me:&quot;I have been advised that the air release you describe is in the design of the machine and this issue is not unique to your vacuum. It is normal for some air to pass through the filter and some to vent from the bottom of the machine.The air that passes through the HEPA filter captures over 99.9% of dust mites, pollen, and ragweed.&quot;No offence to the customer support agent she just gave information what she had to give (provided by tech department, I believe)But still.. this is a crap. How come HEPA filer could work if more than 90% of airflow goes not through the filter?!If you do not care about HEPA filter, it still very good choice - it's quiet, has a nice look, very good telescoping pipe.

Title: excellent
Content:
We've had this vacuum cleaner for half a year now and are very happy with it. I recommend it to everybody. Very light , follows you everywhere , good accessories. It does a very good job and it's easy to get in the corners. So far has been running perfect and we used it a lot.
I wish it had a special bag or something to store all the accessories as I am using trash bags to do that, Would still buy again.

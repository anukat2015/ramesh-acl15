Title: Android revolutionary to Archos for me !
Content:
I upgraded from Archos 5 IMT 160gb to the Archos 5 IT 32gb Android and have never looked back. The sleek look and EASILY pocketable device has become my prime mp3 player and is alot of fun to fool around with. Although, it has its usual archos bugs here and there and it will take some patience to get the device to work the way you like it, but that is part of using a linux based software device. I love it despite its obvious flaws, sometimes internet wont read or it freezes, but for most part it does what i want it todo. Mp3 wise its been perfect especially with the android music software (way more seemless). the screen is incredable as usual and android is very fun.
highly recommend if you are okay with usual archos problems, handful fixed, but still some there. Nothing that deters me though.
thanks for reading!

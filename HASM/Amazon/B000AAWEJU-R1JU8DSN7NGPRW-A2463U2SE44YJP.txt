Title: great purchase
Content:
I purchased this vac after reading reviews of how quiet it is, and was not disappointed.  Our house is small (1000sq. ft.) , and though others say the cord is short, I can do the whole thing without unplugging.  We have hardwood floors and only 2 small area rugs so the standard attachments are fine.  I really like the carpet/wood floor switch on the top of the floor nozzle- easy & convenient. The hose is more flexible than the cheap plastic you find on most other vacs, and so is the cord.  The wheels turn easily, so I'm not bumping into furniture or walls with the canister.  The bags may be small, but the pet hair doesn't get stuck in the filters and clog everything up like on the bagless models I've had.  It's pricy, but already outlasted its predecessor.  Well worth the money.

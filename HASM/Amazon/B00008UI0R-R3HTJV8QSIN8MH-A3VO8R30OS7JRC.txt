Title: Great little vacuum
Content:
I have a Kirby that I use on the carpet. I basically bought this canister to use on furniture, steps, curtains and blinds because . I have always hated attaching the hose to the Kirby to do the those things. Well..this little vacuum really cleans the carpet with the powerhead too.  The suction is unbelievable and the first time I vacuumed the valances I just about pulled them off the wall...but now I am getting better at adjusting the suction control. It's lightweight for doing steps. I have bought another filter so I always have one in the vacuum and one that is cleaned and washed and ready to go. This vaccum is going to be small enough to take in our travel trailer.  I highly recommend it.

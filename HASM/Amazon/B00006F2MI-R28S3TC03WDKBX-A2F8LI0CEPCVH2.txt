Title: Works for me, could be better
Content:
I've had it for two years. It's my first grind and brew so I had no comparison. However as a consumer I felt there should be better ones. I bought it because of its name Cuisinart. It looks very elegant in the kitchen. The biggest drawback is it is really hard to clean if you Grind coffee. Thermo Coffee pot does not really keep coffee hot/Warm. When coffee is ready, you better drink right away. But overall it does work. It makes coffee. It can grind. I set the timer before going to bed and when I wake up coffee is waiting for me. It is noisy when it grinds, but grinding supposed to be noisy, doesn't it.

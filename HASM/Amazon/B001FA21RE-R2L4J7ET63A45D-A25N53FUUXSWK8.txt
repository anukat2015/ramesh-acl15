Title: I'm in LOVE with the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine
Content:
I love the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine and it is a must have for anyone that enjoys wonderful gourmet coffees. It is not a pricy machine and can stand with the best.  The cost is $169.99 and the machine is made by Krups, so I know it is well engineered. The 100% Arabica coffees and Chococinos are made by Nescafe and are SINFULLY GOOD.  I made around 130 cups in a 5 hour period for a function the other day, with NO WAITING on HOT WATER and it made beautiful Lattes and Cappuccinos every time.... so IMPRESSEIVE!  The Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine has 15 bars of pressure and it really froths the milk along with giving a hot cup of coffee every time. It also makes the iced coffees too! The 100% Arabica Coffees, Chococinos and milk come in capsules that you just pop in the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine, no measuring or grinding of beans and I don't need an extra appliance on the kitchen countertop. I have found that the Espresso and Caffé Lungo will run around .50 cents a cup and the milk base drinks will cost me a few pennies over a dollar a cup, gee... that really beats the price of one of my favorite coffee stops.  The Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine is easy to use, easy to clean and delivers a wonderful impressive drink. I give the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine 5 STARS!

Title: Very pleased so far
Content:
It seems to be a better-made machine than the brands we had purchased previously (Krups and Braun top-of-the-line models). Using this daily for several months, I find it is not a bit difficult to clean or keep in great condition. The fact that it looks sleek on the countertop is an appealing feature, too. (This is the best coffeemaker I've ever owned, and the only reason I don't give it a full five stars is that I'm a fairly tough &quot;grader.&quot;)

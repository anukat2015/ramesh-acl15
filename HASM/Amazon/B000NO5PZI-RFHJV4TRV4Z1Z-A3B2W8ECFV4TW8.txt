Title: Amazing suction at low price
Content:
I had an Oreck for years and thought it was doing a good job. I had gotten tired of the high prices for bags and constantly having to remove the roller to get the hair untangled from the edges. 
I couldn't believe it the first time I used the Bissell. The dirt cup was full after only doing half of the living room. It was half sand and half dog hair. It took a couple of weeks to get everything the Oreck left behind. 
I have had it for a year and still love it. I haven't had any of the problems with hair tangling around the roller that I did with the Oreck.  My daughter used it when visiting and said she preferred it to her Kirby vacuum. It is light weight, easy to empty, and the accessories work great on furniture.

Title: not for anyone with an above-average sense of smell
Content:
The bad smell this thing emanates persists, albeit at much lower levels, even after 4 months of use. It heats my medium-sized room very well and rapidly, but it dawned on me that it's a bit stupid to have a heater that requires me to leave all the bloody windows open in the middle of winter. It may just be my unit though; if most people didn't have a problem with it, it's probably safer to think that their experience will mirror yours.

Title: more convenient than instant coffee!!
Content:
this is my first foray into single-cup coffeemaker, and i'm not going to miss our coffee grinder and the maker. it does make some noise, but definitely quieter than a grinder - if you're trying to make a cup of coffee without waking everyone up in our small house, the grinder is a no-no. initially setting up the machine took a little bit of time, but it was still only a few minutes of reading.
positives:
- wow, it's easy to use. just stick a t-disc and press the button. it's so convenient that you end up consuming more coffee than expected. (hmmm, maybe this is a negative...)
- no coffee ground mess on the counter!!!
- easy to clean and maintain - way easier than the grinder/maker combo.
- can make coffee, latte, cappuccino, espresso and hot chocolate.
- no leftover coffee that festers in the pot like a regular coffeemaker.
negatives:
- environmentally horrific to throw away all those t-disc containers.
- don't expect the most amazing cup of coffee because you're limited in choices - starbucks' africa kitamu variety is the best for those who are used to grinding their own beans and doing the work. it's still good, but you're just not gonna get the most premium coffee - goodbye, organic blue bottle coffee.
- the mavea water filter says to change the filter every two months, so it gauges how long the filter has been in use - NOT how full the filter is. (btw, you don't have to use the filter.)
if you want the absolute best cup of coffee, this is not the way to go since the super-premium brands aren't offered, but for most people who aren't extreme coffee connoisseurs, this makes a very fine cup, and we certainly do not miss the mess created by coffee grounds. we'll be sticking with the starbucks variety which has extra large discs since they contain more coffee than other t-discs. so convenient, we love it.

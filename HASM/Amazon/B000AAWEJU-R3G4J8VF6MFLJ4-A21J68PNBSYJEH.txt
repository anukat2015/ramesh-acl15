Title: The Only Brand For A Vacuum Cleaner PERIOD!!
Content:
I bought this vacuum after getting a catalog that had Miele vacuums in.  I never heard of them.  I went to a local shop that sold them and looked them over and tested them out.  From the moment you see them you see QUALITY.  It is obvious.  These are the best vacuums out there for the money.  You spend more upfront, but what you get is an invesment piece for years to come.  Do not hesitate to buy any one of Miele's vacuums.  They truly are excepitonal.  This vacuum works very well.  I have the turbo brush to pick up pet hair.  This works great.  There is no need to spend the money on the capricorn unless you have very deep pile carpeting.  this brush gets everything off the carpet and what is hidden in the carpet as well.

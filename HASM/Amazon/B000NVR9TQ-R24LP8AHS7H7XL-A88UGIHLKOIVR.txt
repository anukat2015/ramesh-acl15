Title: Worst AC I've ever Used
Content:
Do not buy this Air Conditioner.  This machine does not get my 10'x10' room below 79 degrees.  I've already installed the machine and had to spend cab fair to get the machine to may apartment.  At this point it's pointless to bring it back as the packaging is destroyed and the cab fair is expensive.  Do not buy this machine!

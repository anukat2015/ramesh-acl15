Title: much better than an ipod
Content:
My son bought one and when his brother's ipod broke, he wanted a Zune instead.  It has an FM radio, you can easily transfer any music, great features, and the price was much less than an ipod.  We will never buy apple products again as they are too proprietary.  Our whole family will be buying one.  You can also search around and find better deals on the Zune.  Amazon had the black one for $50 cheaper than the others.  GREAT PRODUCT

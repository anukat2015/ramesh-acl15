Title: NOT HAPPY
Content:
The heaters came within 2 days after I ordered them. I open up the outside cartons and saw right away that these were used (not reconditioned or new) products. One of the boxes had a note from the previous customer dated Feb 2009, stating the heater did not work correctly.... My wife and I were upset and sent them back the next day 12/2/2009. I am still waiting for my account to be credited. These were supposed to be gift items.
not happy in Lynn, Mass

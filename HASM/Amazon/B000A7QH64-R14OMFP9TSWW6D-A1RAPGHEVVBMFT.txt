Title: charger problem
Content:
I have two Shark 15.6V, one charger stop work in 6 months, the other stop work in 9 months, as they suggested I bought one new charger ($14), it only last for 2 months, asked warranty for charger but they suggested me buy new one again.  I quite no more. 
Do not buy the new charger as they ask you the quality control is bad.

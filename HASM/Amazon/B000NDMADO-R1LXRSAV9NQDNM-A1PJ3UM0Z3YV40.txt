Title: Sometimes we cant go by name alone
Content:
For the past 3 months since I bought this machine I have mentally written my review of it every time I vacuumed my house. Dont get me wrong... I absolutely am a 100% Dyson fan when it comes to the uprights. I also spent the last 5 years of my life owning a cleaning company both in Europe and in America so I have had my share of vacuum experiences.
The canister is such a let down. The cord is way too short, the quick draw pipe suction for corners and crevices you can get from the upright is totally lost on this big clunky wand. I hate how the hose kinks constantly, oh it sucks the life out of your every fiber of your carpet, but will also eat any loose ends.
This is an over priced vacuum with a lot of wow factor to look at, which is all I do with mine now since I have both the DC 07 (which in Dysons defense I give ********** ten stars) I tend to just haul the DCO7 up and down the stairs and glare at the DC21. What is Mr Dyson's problem with the attachments also? They are not all included AND irk of all irks are NOT interchangeable with other Dyson models.
I feel it is my duty to mankind to write this review. Please dont buy this overpriced excuse for a vacuum.

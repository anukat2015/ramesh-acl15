Title: No Net Library? No Bookmarking? No Sale!
Content:
This is not a machine for the 40+ crowd that shuns the attention fracturing music of today's youth. One of these days the mega Zunipod corporations will realize that much of the well-to-do middle aged and up demographic actually listen to BOOKS on their MP3 players.
What the audiofile wants in an MP3 player is:
1. 'Plays for Sure' compatibility so that we can copy our NET LIBRARY books using Windows Media Player to our audio devices.
2. BOOKMARKING!!!!! A 17 hour WMA file is a sad thing when you lose your place in it and have to start over. Without bookmarking the player is essentially 'highjacked' by the book because if you move to another sound file you lose your place. (Note that this is not an issue for Zune. Although it won't bookmark, you can't get Net Library books on it in the first place!)
The final word is: If you want to listen to audio books, get a Creative or a Rio with 'Bookmarking.' Avoid this device.

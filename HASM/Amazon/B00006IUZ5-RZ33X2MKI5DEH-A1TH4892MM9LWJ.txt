Title: Quick & easy
Content:
Love my new Hot Shot.  I've had one for the last 10 years.  So when my old one got a little rickety, I bought another.  I like the sleek new look, and it works just as well as the old model.  Only thing I question is the start button at the top of the unit, which you have to push hard to turn on.  It just feels a little cheesy.  I'll let you know how long it lasts.

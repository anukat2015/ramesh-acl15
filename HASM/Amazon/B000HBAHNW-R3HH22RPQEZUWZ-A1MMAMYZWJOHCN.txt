Title: Don't waste your time on any vacuum cleaner but Miele
Content:
The Miele I have is no longer produced...the Red Star...so this is a general review of Miele canister vacuum cleaners.  The reason I'm not reviewing a more recent model is that my Red Star -- now 13 years old -- is still going strong and doesn't need to be replaced.  Thirteen years ago when I purchased it, I paid $750 and everyone thought I was insane.  I had heard that Miele was the way to go and time has shown that to be true.  In the time I've had this vacuum, most people have spent at least that much on lesser vacuums and replacements.  I've had two repairs needed...not to the motor...but to the dust channel and elbow, the plastic connector parts that you drag the vacuum around by.  Each was a part I just bought and snapped on myself for less than $30 each.  This vacuum, as far as I can tell, is as powerful and has as much sucking power as the day I bought it.  I'm embarrased to admit that I have abused this vacuum in that I have actually vacuumed potting soil off of my balcony with it...and an occasional leaf...which I don't recommend...but it's still going strong.  It's never been opened or serviced.  It rips pet hair up like nothing else.  I love it and would not hesitate to buy another if the need ever arose.  It's a terrible, ridiculous outlay of money up front....but 13 years later it has proven to be a wonderful investment and a tool that is used over and over in my home.

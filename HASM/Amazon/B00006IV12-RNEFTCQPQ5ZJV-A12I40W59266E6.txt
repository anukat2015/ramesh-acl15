Title: Good Product
Content:
It is a good product, but only five temporary can be chosen. Sometimes it is very cold in my room, but the heater is not running even I adjust to 80 degree. So, I have to click the button to keep it running without temporary setting. And then, I was woken up at night because it is too hot! Not very convenient.

Title: Easy to use and fits in small spaces
Content:
I love this coffeemaker. Doesn't take up much space (perfect for living at a beach house!). Brews quick and no mess. The travel mug is sturdy and the lid snaps securely for those crazy commutes! Buy with confidence, I will surely give it as a gift to my coffee loving friends.

Title: Heaters
Content:
The Holmes HQH307 heater is ok if you need to heat a small room. It is a bit on the noisy side of heaters. Also, it is not as energy efficient as other radiant heaters like the WindChaser or other by Soleris models. As with any heating element beware of keeping to close to curtains or other flamables and of couse children...

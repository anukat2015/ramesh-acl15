Title: Pretty and Efficient
Content:
What a joy to use for keeping your wood floors looking beautiful.  The "wheels" make pushing and turning the Dirt Devil a breeze.  I've even run it over carpet for some quick pick ups.  Animal hair does accumulate as there is static cling at the base and bottom so be sure to wipe your little Devil clean after using.  I highly recommend this product for use on wood floors.

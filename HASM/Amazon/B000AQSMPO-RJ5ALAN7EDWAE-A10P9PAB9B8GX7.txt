Title: Perfect addition to any office, worth the cost, does more than just coffee!
Content:
Most other reviewers have already pointed out the merits of this system, here is why I love it for our office-
Making a pot of coffee for a few cups is a hassle, no one wants stale coffee, no one wants to clean the pot to make a new pot, we had to go to the restroom to clean the pots, not an easy task.
Now, we just drop in a K-cup, throw away the used K-cup and instantly enjoy a perfect cup of coffee. Fresh each cup. Many may have remarked that it is a bit expensive, but when you factor in the convenience, it is the only way to go.
With the B60 and its 3 cup size settings we have discovered some other uses. We use it regularly to make perfect "Cup of Noodles", you know, the noodles that come in a cup and all you have to do is add water, use the 9.25 ounce setting (third button) for a perfect pour for "Cup of Noodles", put back foil lid, wait 3 minutes, umm-good!
Another great use is for making "Swiss Miss" type instant cocoa. I like to customize my instant cocoa, I put one packet in an 8-ounce cup, I usually add a little half and half, then I press the first button on the B60 (this button adds just a little less than 8 ounces), it adds just enough water to mixture to bring it to a perfect level.
Oh yeah, the use the B60 without K-cups, simply lift the handle, remove the old K-cup if one is in the hopper, then lower the handle, put cup below spout and press appropriate button.
BTW, I prefer the Van Houtte line of K-cups.

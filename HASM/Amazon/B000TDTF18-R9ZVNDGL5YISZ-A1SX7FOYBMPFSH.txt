Title: Avoid this coffemaker
Content:
This coffeemaker attracted me because of it's front access. Within 2 weeks of purchase it stopped working, simply refused to brew. Fool that I am I went out and bought a replacement. Guess what, 3 weeks later (today) the 2nd coffemaker once again stopped just like the first. The second maker also had a problem with the hotplate coating peeling within the first week of use. Do yourself a favor, don't get one of these unless it's a freebie. And even if it is given to you for nothing, keep a jar of instant coffee in the cupboard..just in case.

Title: Zune Man
Content:
I like it.  Had a Sandisk 8gb which was pretty good but wanted more memory so which one: zune or ipod.  I chose the zune for the price.
I'm very happy with it.  I can put everything on it.
The only problem is with the software.  It locks up on occassion.  You would think Microsoft would be able to find an easier way to program your zune.
With a little work, I have been able to do what I want it to do.  
I like the player so much my son got one.  He is very happy with it.
I would recommend it unless you are tech-illiterate.  The software my be too complicated for you.  For the price vs. ipod, I'll buy the zune everytime.

Title: Nicest for the money
Content:
I purchased the Nikon D90 body only because I already had many lenses from previous Nikon cameras.
Having shot not an extreme amount of pictures,I would, by what I have seen from the exposures, rate it amongst the top of the line.  The quality of the camera is the top of the line with 12.3 megapixels the quality of the pictures are there also.  I am a good photographer but do not make a living from photography.  I think photography is a tough road because everyone thinks they are good whether they are good or not.  I see many poor photographs trying to be sold and they think owning and using a nice camera makes them good.  It is in the eye.  If you do not have the eye, develop it.  No amount of equipment will make you good.  It may help but that is the extent of it.  I would have liked to have known what dx means.  It means that it is not a true 35mm format camera.  This means that the old 35mm lens focal length have to be adjusted by multiplying by a factor of 1.5.  This by no means takes away from the quality of the camera but would have been nice to know.  To get a true 35mm format camera you have to buy the 300, 700, D3 or above.  This increase in focal length can actually work to ones advantage because a 200mm lens is now 300mm lens but a 28mm lens is now a 42mm lens so to get a true 28mm you have to purchase an 18mm (which is really a 27mm)lens.
It is like owning a camera, a photo lab, a computer, cellphone (whoops no telephone here) all in one.  It can be as complicated as you want or can be as simple as a pointie-shootie camera. But if all that you want is a pointie-shootie buy a cheaper camera and save your money.  Whatever you buy, just remember it is in the glass not the bells and whistles.

Title: Glad I got a Canon XSi
Content:
I purchased the Canon XSi back in April.  I debated for two months as this was going to be my first real DSLR.  I looked at the 40D, the 50D, the XTi and I just ended up making a simple choice (I knew I wanted Canon) based on the price, features, the pixel count, the lenses available and my skill level.  This camera has lived up to my expectations and I am glad I decided on the XSi.  I also purchased a Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 to go with it and the combination is excellent!  Get a Canon if you are not sure what to get.

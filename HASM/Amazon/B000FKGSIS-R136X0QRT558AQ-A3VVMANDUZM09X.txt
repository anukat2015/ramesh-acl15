Title: Best little heater I've used!
Content:
I've had this unit for 2 years and it is the best little heater I've ever owned.  It's very, very quiet, and on low setting it heats up the room very quickly.  All in all, I'm sold on Holmes products.  I've had a Holmes window fan that, at over 10 years old, has outlasted and outperformed 3 others from different makers (Conair and Windemere).  
The temperature setting mechanism is a little annoying - if you miss the temperature you want, you have to cycle through all of the settings to get back to where you want, but that's a small thing to me.

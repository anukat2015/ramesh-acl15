Title: Don't Buy.  Not Reliable.
Content:
I bought this product in January 2009, and 6 months later, the motor started to fade away.  Dirt Devil won't give us another one because they said that they don't make it anymore.  I can see that they are still being sold everywhere.  Because of the 2-year warranty, they offered me something else.  Now, I'm stuck with a case of filters without a vaccum.  Dirt Devil said they won't take them because we didn't buy the filters directly from them.  They make the filters, and their name is on them.  I just don't understand why they wouldn't let me exchange them for the filters for the replacement one.

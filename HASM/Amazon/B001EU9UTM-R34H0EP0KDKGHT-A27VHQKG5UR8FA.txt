Title: Instant gratification at low cost
Content:
Thanks for all the reviews here and thought to give it a try and love it! No need to have a stainless steel pitcher - another kitchen clutter. A deep mug or cup will do just fine for frothing. I usually have latte not cappuccino at Starbucks and now addicted to cappuccino because it's fun to make all that foam. Kinda lazy so just use Walmart's Sumatra French roast ground and tests almost like Starbucks! One more thing cannot get at Starbucks - use organic milk.

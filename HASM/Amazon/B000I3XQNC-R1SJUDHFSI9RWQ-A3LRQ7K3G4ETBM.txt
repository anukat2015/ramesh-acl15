Title: Great Starter SLR
Content:
This XTi is a solid entry level digital SLR.  It is many auto features for a novice like my self to use.  As my abilities increase  the camera has potential as well.  After using the quick start guide I have been able to use this camera almost immediately.  It is versatile in that you can mount EF-S and EF model lenses with the camera.  It is a good starter SLR.  I do recommend buying the lens separately from the standard 18-55mm lens.  The kit lens lacks the USM and the IS, but features add to the camera.

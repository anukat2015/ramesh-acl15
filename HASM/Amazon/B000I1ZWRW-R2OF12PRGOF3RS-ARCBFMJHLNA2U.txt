Title: Thanks a lot Canon
Content:
so i took delivery of this camera last night and bought a different lens instead of the standard supplied with a zoom to 200.  got it home and took an up close photo of my wifes face.  if that isn't bad enough i then used the zoom function on the LCD screen and could just see every line pimple and pore on her face. i'd never really noticed before and now i feel i have to divorce her.  so this is probably going to be the most expensive gadget i've ever bought!  thanks Canon,  i'll be sure to send the lawyers fees to you! my previous camera was a sony point and shoot which only took blurred photos.  she looks so much better blurred!

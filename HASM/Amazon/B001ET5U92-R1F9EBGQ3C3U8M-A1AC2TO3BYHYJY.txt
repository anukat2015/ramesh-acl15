Title: Really great camera!
Content:
Wow, what a nice camera to hold and use! I regularly shoot with a D700 and D3s, but when I picked this up for my wife, I had a hard time putting it down.
Of course it wont be as good as those cameras for really low light or pro level shooting for sports, but it more than holds its own otherwise.
You can get to just about anything from the buttons and menus, and the camera is really light and compact. Image quality is also very good.
My wife is very pleased, and shes not the kind of person who is impressed by technology easily.
For more technical folks... it has on demand grid lines, exposure comp can be changed by a button on the front, as can release mode (single, low, high) and AF node.
If you shoot flash, the built in flash can be used in command mode to control speedlights. It also has a cool calendar view of pictures taken thats really handy.... wish the D700 and D3s had that.
Very nice camera!

Title: It's BETTER than I expected.
Content:
A bunch of us at work regularly raid another department's supply of Keurig coffee, as they have the industrial strength machine, which is not available to the general public (I checked).  I already knew how great the coffee tasted and how easy the big machine was to use, but having one in my own kitchen is a true delight.
The B-60 is moronically simple to use and is also an attractive addition to our kitchen, with the chrome accents and blue backlit water reservoir and LCD control.  What I didn't know was that you can keep the machine on 24/7 and the water stays hot and ready to brew.  From the time you drop a K-Cup in the machine, you have but 40 seconds total to enjoy a cup of fine coffee.  YUM!

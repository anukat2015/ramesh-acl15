Title: What a Great Camera
Content:
In my humble opinion, any beginner to intermediate photographer cannot go wrong with this camera. I may not have the experience like some but I will say this: As a father of 4, I have no problems getting great shots of my family at any activity. Be it indoors or out, low light or in the sun, my pictures are 90% fantastic. The other 10% is my own error (rushing the shot, moving, etc...). 
It is easy to setup, takes a little more time to understand all of the features but by no means impossible. Requires a little patience and understanding (like any new device). 
I purchased the telephoto lens, battery grip, lens covers and speedlight and I just love the quality, speed and ease that I have to enjoy these precious moments. And with the help of Photoshop, even little mistakes disappear. All of this for an investment of less than $1,000.
In these times when dollars are a little harder to come by, I found this to be a great value and extremely satisfying.

Title: D300/D90 are fantastic  .... from a long time Canon shooter
Content:
I'm a long time Canon shooter, about 20 years actually. I decided to go "to the dark side" a few months ago due to ongoing quality control problems w/ Canon. I recently purchased a D300, D90, Sigma 150 macro, Nikon 16-85 VR and Nikon 70-300 VR to replace my Canon 1D Mark II, 40D and assorted lenses. The D300 is by far the best camera I think I've ever used and the D90 is almost as good. While the D90 doesn't have the weather sealed build or AF system of the D300, it is still built very well and also has a nice accurate AF system. I'd say the D90 offers 80% of what the D300 does at a much better price point for most people. Even the kit lens for the D90 is better than I expected, though I do wish it had a metal mount instead of plastic. Nice job Nikon. The only thing I miss from the Canon line-up is their pro-quality F4L lineup (17-40, 24-105, 70-200) but the above mentioned Nikon consumer glass comes very very close to the quality of the Canon pro glass at a fraction of the cost so I'm not complaining.
I ordered both bodies and my lenses from Amazon. All were shipped very quickly even though I chose the free super-saver shipping. I've had problems w/ Amazon's warehouse shipping expensive camera gear in big boxes w/ little or no padding in the past and have returned several items shipped to me like that. I'm happy to say the last 3 or 4 things I've ordered from Amazon have come pretty well packaged which means they are paying attention to customer comments and feedback. The D90 I just received was in a big box but had plenty of bubble to keep it safe and secure during transport. Well done Amazon.

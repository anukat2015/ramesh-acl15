Title: Great notebook, but horrible keyboard.
Content:
Pros:
* Beautiful design
* Lightweight
* Runs Vista well
* Cool operating temps
* Did I mention beautiful design?
Cons:
* Absolutely horrible keyboard
If MSI does not release a replacement keyboard for purchase, I will likely get rid of this thing.

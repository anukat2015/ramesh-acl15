Title: Okay if you're willing to put up with certain issues
Content:
I've been interested in getting an Archos player for a few years and finally broke down and got the Archos 5 media tablet.  It's a great little gadget - I travel a lot and to be able to have ALL my music AND movies on one player is great.  
-Yes, it holds all your music, say, your I-tunes library, but if you want to PLAY them, you have to buy the add-on.  
-Really cool that you can record ANYTHING video onto it, but: First, you need to buy the docking station.  Second, I have an issue with the unit overheating regularly which causes it to lock up.  -You're recording a 2 hr. movie and after 3/4 of it, the thing overheats and locks up on you.  I have to put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes JUST to get it to shut off.  THEN you have to let it cool down, delete and start all over again.  
I would recommend waiting a few more years for Archos to WORK OUT THESE bugs before purchasing one of these units.  Great idea, just not thought out.  PLEASE Archos, get it together!

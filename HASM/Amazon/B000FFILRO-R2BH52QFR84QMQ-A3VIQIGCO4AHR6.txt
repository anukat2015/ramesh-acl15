Title: Good Coffee Maker For Large Brews Only
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift and mine is the exact same as this model but in white. The coffee comes out very hot and very consistent however it is not made for smaller brews.  I typically like to brew 1-2 cups worth of coffee and this coffee maker seems designed for 10 cups.  My smaller Krups coffee maker makes better coffee at smaller brews however the key benefit I see to this coffee maker is that the water is really hot and it brews fast, very fast. 
You basically never turn it off either.  You first fill the tank with 2 full pots worth of water and leave it on.  Takes about 15 minutes to heat up, which you only have to do the first time you use it. Remember that you never turn it off.  You then put in your coffee grounds, and turn the warmer on.  After that you fill up the desired amount of water in the decanter for your brew and pour it into the top.  The additional water you added causes the heated water in the tank to displace and thats what brews your coffee.

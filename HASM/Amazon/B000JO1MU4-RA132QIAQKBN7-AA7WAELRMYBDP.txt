Title: Good, but could be better
Content:
This product is nice, great scrolling, great quality of music, great capacity, but there are some things that could use some work. The headphones can sometimes slide out of slot, the IPod can lag, like the scrolling time and quality, and the screen can go blank sometimes, even while scrolling. This product is great, yet it could be a little better.

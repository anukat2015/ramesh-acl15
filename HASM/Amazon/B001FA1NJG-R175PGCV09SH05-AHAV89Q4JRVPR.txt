Title: A great device
Content:
In our family we've used Zune 30s, Zune 80s and Zune 120s, and loved them all.
The actual device itself works quite well and is easy to operate.
The Windows Zune software works well too. The latest upgrade that came with the release of the Zune HD makes the software very snazzy, while still being easy.
The feature that makes the Zune the best is the Zune Pass subscription services. For $15 a month you get to download and listen to as much music as you want. There is no limit. In the past I used to buy about one CD per month. Now, I spend about the same amount of money, but get ten times as much music. I could download and listen to way more, but there are only so many hours in the day. We're allowed to keep ten tracks per month permanently, but I don't really bother. To be honest, I like to sample music and don't really find myself listening to old music that much. I have a giant pile of old CDs that hardly ever get played. There's too much new music to discover to really go back and spend a lot of time on the old stuff. You probably have a habit of listening to your old CDs, but if you had a Zune Pass you'd find yourself listening to a lot more new music.

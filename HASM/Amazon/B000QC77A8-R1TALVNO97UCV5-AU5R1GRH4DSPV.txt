Title: A great little heater
Content:
I just received my Lasko 75800 Cyclonic Ceramic heater yesterday.  I unpacked it and immediately began using it.  My home is designed with a very open floor space, with the living room, dining room two hallways and kitchen.  I closed the doors to all my bedrooms and rooms not being used, placed my central air on 60 degrees and my Lasko on 70 degrees.  Within two hours, my living area was at 70 degrees.  The outside temperature was around 50.
I have ordered another unit to reduce the amount of time to heat my home and not overwork this wonderful little heater.  
It's amazing that this little unit can warm such a large area.  With two units, I'm sure to keep my entire living area warm and not use my central air so much.  
Hope they can improve fans and air conditioners for the summer!

Title: great vac, but hard to clean
Content:
This hand vac is powerful, and sucks debris in easily. However when it is time to empty it, the filter assembly resists coming apart without lots of effort. I have had two of this model of Hoover hand vacsHoover S1120 Hand Held Wet/Dry Hand Vacuum Cleaner, and both have this problem.

Title: Best Apple laptop in last 10 years
Content:
I have used almost all of Apple laptops in the last 10 years and to me this macbook is the best fit for my needs (portability and power). It is as powerful as a MBP, lighter than the previous model, and has a fantastic display and trackpad. Firewire would have been nice, but usb drives and peripherals are cheaper anyway.
I have retired my desktop.
Very satisfied.

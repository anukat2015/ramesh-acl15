Title: Buyer beware!
Content:
I love this vacuum cleaner.  I have two Huskies that shed continiously and this vacuum cleaner makes short work of all the hair.  No smell left lingering because of the hepa filter and best of all NO BAG to replace. Be careful of the cord connected on the power head.  Mine shorted out and burned the carpet.  1 week later, the on/off button on the handle quit working.  I'm glad these things decided to go out before the 1 year warranty was up, otherwise I would be out $140.00.  After warranty, a different machine.

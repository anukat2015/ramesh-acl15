Title: Great idea...not so great on the execution
Content:
I loved the idea of having a long reach, battery rechargeable vacuum to pick up hair balls and debris in a hard-wood floored home, but unfortunately the result left me with just an idea and not a great vacuum.
The product's battery life is only about 10 minutes, offers poor suction, doesn't pick up anything remotely heavy and the chamber that catches all the debris is too small.
Don't buy this product until they improve on it or a better one comes along.

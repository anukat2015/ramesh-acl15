Title: Watch your flash mechanism
Content:
I have had to retunr this product five times for a flash problem. Locks up either after 3 pics for 60 seconds, or won't shoot at all when flash is needed. Canon will not replace with a new one, and customer service is awfu. The keep "fixing it," yet within 3 weeks of getting it back, it craps out again! I have the first digital Rebel (model), bought in 2003. It still shoots like a charm and has never given me an a bit of trouble. It's mega pixel is outdated, as well as other features compared to XTI. Big mess - piece of junk!

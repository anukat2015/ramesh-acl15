Title: great Christmas gift
Content:
I was searching for a surprize gift for my wife for Christmas (after 38 years, this can be difficult)...I made a list of what she likes/does...coffee was near the top...although she has a large coffemaker, she usually only makes a cup or two on weekday mornings before she goes to work...I read a great many reviews of this and other similar products (I always read the negative reviews first)...I advised my wife of the "problems" noted...she has not had any trouble with this product, and she uses it 5 days a week...the large size of the cup is just the right amount to enjoy before going to work...she also likes the paperless basket, as she grinds her own beans, and she has no trouble with solids in her coffee...all in all, a product that does the job at a very reasonable price...she would recommend it to anyone....

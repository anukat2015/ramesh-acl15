Title: Good Camera for its price
Content:
I already own a D90 and just purchased it as a gift item. The camera performs very well in all preset modes . Its a very nice camera if you are just stepping into the SLR photography realm. I specially liked the High ISO performance of the camera. One thing that i was concerned about though was the Av mode which had problems calculating the Shutter speed at low light and the images were blurred. Not sure if the kit lens was the issue or if the issue is with the Av mode itself. Hence i had to use either Tv or M mode. Preset modes are great . Good camera for all starters...

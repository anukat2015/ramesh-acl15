Title: All Day Sucker
Content:
My rating is based on perceptions and comparisons to other canister type vacuums I have owned or tested. Subjective valuation that it is, the critical factor for me is how well does any vacuum meets the primary need, the ability to clean a wide range of carpet types and I have to acknowledge a preference for upright models. This Panasonic model appears to be a decent unit however I didn't think it was superior to the Eureka 4780GZ Upright in effective suction (I also felt the Eureka was better in that respect than some Dyson models I tried, particularly when cost is a major consideration) although there were other factors that may influence a consumer who does not have a specific preference to select this canister unit.  I want any vacuum to suck up dirt like a Steelers' left tackle loading up his plate with food at the training table buffet and the Panasonic was more like a high school wrestler attempting to make weight.

The MC-CG885 appears to be positioned in the mid-range of Panasonic canister models. Another unit with an agitator, among a few other esoterics, costs approximately $200.00 more.  When I looked at the added features, the additional cost did not appear justified.  The same assessment came into view when looking at the next model directly above this one, the MC-CG887 where the most significant distinction is a telescopic wand.
 
We no longer have shedding pets and after having seized the motors of multiple units in the past, that thought always enters my mind. I'm not convinced the unit will prove to be completely effective over the long term for those that do have pets as it has a power nozzle but lacks the agitator.

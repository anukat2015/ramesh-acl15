Title: Mr NO-heater
Content:
I bought this unit in Nov 2007.  I have had trouble with it from day one.  The company has been good to work with ( they sent replacement parts) but it just stopped working again. Parts come but takes 2 weeks or so. They don't rush it.  3 times now in 4 months.  It is garbage and should be recalled and taken off the market.  Spend more or get a different brand but stay away from this. I put one star only because that was as low as it would go.

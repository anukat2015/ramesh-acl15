Title: Best Camera, I mean it
Content:
After researching all the available DSLR's cameras online with in depth reviews from reputable unbiased sites, I found the sony alpha 300k, to be the best price/product available. 
I have tried the nikon D 60, and then returned it,.I am aamazed at the sony alpha 300 ease of use and excellent pictures quality. All the features included, i.e.: tiltable screen, live view, extra foucs, steady shot and the 2 lenses i got with it, I thought this to be a steal...
I am a beginner with DSLR's but not with photography,..I thought i will be using the live view, but I find myself shooting more with the OVF.
All the reviews about the small size of the OVF are bull, you see what you are supposed to see and what you need to see to take excellent photos... the CF feature is great. 
I bought the extra flash (199, ONLY 99 W/SPECIAL COMBO OFFER), the pictures qualities at night are amazing, it adjust automatically to the zoom degree to give excellent exposure.
I bought extra batteries, sony alpha bag, and uv protector lens. I think i'll be bying the 28-300 mm zoom sigma lens once the price drops some more..
Overall, after spending hourse of reserches, I was drawne to the this sony alpha 300,..i did not know about it befiore, but i am extrmely pleased with the pics quality. ps the 14 mp, does not make a lot of difference unless you are shooting in macro, as the lens mount is the same for the 300 and the 350, in fact it may blurr the puiture by trying to insert more mp through the same size lenses,.. i am glade i stuck to the 300 and saved me 200 dollars.
The camera built and feel is excellent very pro, and is very well designed even for the smallest fingers, has a great grip and feels well buils, unlike the nikon d-60.
So all of you who may be confused about the camera or what to get: the sony will not disapoint, I am picky by nature and can not find flaws in this machine yet... just make sure to get the extra flash (wireless), and some extra zooming lenses,.. you'll be happy you did.
Amazon deliverd the camera in under 1 week, excellent conditions. Just buy the CF, i found the transcend brand to be exceptionaqlly good and fast. get the 8 gb it is a bargain and do not forget the CF reader as most computer doe not have ability to read cf yet. it cost about 15-30 dollars depending on brand. 
Happy photography dslr style.

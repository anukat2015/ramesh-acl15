Title: Heat and lid warping problems - and Sony doesn't honor warranty or stand behind products - beware.
Content:
I bought the white version of this model # Sony Vaio laptop less than a month ago. Within 3 weeks of buying it, the top of the laptop started to discolor and warp from the inside. After HOURS of explaining and re-explaining the situation to Sony's TERRIBLE customer service, they sent a box for me to send the laptop to California for repair. 
A week later, I got an estimate from Sony for $177 for the repair. They determined that they won't cover this repair, and implied that I did something wrong that caused my computer to warp and discolor from the inside. I didn't. 
My experience with Sony and the VAIO has been extremely frustrating, and now I'm out over $800 for a computer that I can't resell from a company I will never do business with again. 
&lt;u> Beware:&lt;/u> Sony's customer service is terrible. If you have a problem with this computer, you are on your own - they will not help or stand behind the VAIO. 
P.S.  Do a search for VAIO problems, or check out Sony's Vaio user forums to see all the other people who are having the same non-service issues.

Title: Excellent body to start with!
Content:
I have been using Canon's point-and-shoot for numerous of years now.  I thought about purchasing S3 or S5 for a while due to the integrated IS.  However, after much research, and consideration, I decided to purchase the Rebel XTi.  S3, S5 are great cameras but if I wanted to go beyond point-and-shoot in the future, I would have to purchase another camera.  It just made sense, economically to buy XTi right now.
I have had this camera for a little less than a month now, and I am VERY happy with the purchase!
For a SLR, Rebel XTi is much smaller, easier for me to handle since I'm a fairly petite person with smaller hands. I don't know much about photography for now (am still learning) but the manual included in the system explains enough where I can play around and get a feeling for it.
I have taken this camera to the school yard to take pictures of my students and the results are way better than my point-and-shoot.  I can take pictures in the moment with my students instead of the-moment-after.  The other thing is I can take the pictures in RAW form and use Photoshop to manipulate without worrying the original picture has lost its information.
The only gripe I have is why not build IS with the camera instead of the lens?  Again, perhaps because I am an amateur, haven't learned that much about photography yet and thus don't know the reason behind it.  But, this means I can't wait to get lenses with IS.
Overall, I am happy with this camera and am looking forward to learning more about photography.

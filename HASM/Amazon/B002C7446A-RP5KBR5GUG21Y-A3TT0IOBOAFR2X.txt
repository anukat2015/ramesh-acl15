Title: I'd buy one for everyone I knew if I could
Content:
Been a PC user for about 10 years. Grew a bit frustrated with my PC only having a year or two of good-great performance.
Long story short, if you are considering this product, it is worth it and then some. I've never had a more enjoyable computing experience. I'm not a real "graphic/video/photo/gaming" guy, but I can't stop smiling every time I use this machine. I had to fire up my Asus netbook the other day and I wanted to throw it across the room. 
Lastly, consider how much most of us use computers these days. 8-18 hours a day? This product is like buying your first nice bed. How did you sleep before? Sorry for gushing. I'd pay more. I can't keep up with Firefox, my wireless operates flawlessly, back lit keyboard is awesome for working with a glass of wine in a dark room.
I ordered mine from Apple and got a $100 student discount and free 8gb ipod touch.

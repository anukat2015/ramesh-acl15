Title: I LOVE this vacuum!
Content:
I have five cats...two of them long-haired.  This vacuum is an answer to a prayer.  I have noticed a huge difference in accumulation of fur and allergin-related sneezing in the mornings.   
The only drawback is that it is a bit heavy.  I also have two sets of carpeted stairs, and even with the great attachments, it is quite the behemoth the lug up and down. 
Two thumbs up (but would like a mini version for the stairs).

Title: Nikon D80 Review
Content:
The Nikon D80 is an excellent mid range camera that works well with previously purchased lens for the Nikon system.  The metering functions are great, and the processing power is awesome.  This is a great travel camera with good weight and it feels good in the hand. I have no disappointments with the camera.  The supplied software suite was easy to install and the interface with the camera worked well the first time I used it.  I recommend this camera if one does not want to make the jump to the D300.  Most individuals will be unable to detect the difference in 10 megapixels verses 12 megapixels.  This camera should produce some great photo enlargements.

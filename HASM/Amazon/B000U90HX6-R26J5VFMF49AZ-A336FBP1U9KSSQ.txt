Title: Terrific Heater!
Content:
We've shopped and shopped and bought several types of electric room heaters (panel heaters, oil filled baseboard and radiator styles, etc.), and we haven't been happy with any of them.  This Lasko heater has ended our search!  It pumps out lots of heat and the louvered adjuster lets you direct the heat straight into the room, straight up, or anywhere in between.  The fan is not silent, but it also isn't obnoxious! We have it in our bedroom and we sleep fine with it running. Probably the best feature is the very accurate thermostat control that lets you set a digital temperature.  It brings the room up to that temperature and shuts down when not needed. That saves energy.  The remote control is a really convenient addition. The one possible down side is its size.  The heater is large, but it is designed so that you can put it right up against a wall with no concern for safety. So you should be able to find a convenient location in any room.  Like all space heaters, it works best in a closed room, but we've used it in our large open family room, kitchen, dining room with good results compared to other room heaters. We like it so much we are ordering another!

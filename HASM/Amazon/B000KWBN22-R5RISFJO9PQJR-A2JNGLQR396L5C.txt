Title: Turns off automatically
Content:
This heater turns off automatically way too fast (must be tripping overheat shut-off).  Will not even run for more than 2-3 minutes at a time.  It will then take about 5 minutes to cool down enough to turn back on.  Go with something else unless you like your heat in extremely short bursts.

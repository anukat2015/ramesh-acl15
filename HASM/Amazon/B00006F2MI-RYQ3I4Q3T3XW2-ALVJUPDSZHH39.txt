Title: Worth it!!
Content:
my brother has had this coffee pot for about 3 years and they really enjoy theirs. so on deciding whether or not to buy one, i have read so many of the reviews on this. i decided to buy it and i agree it is too tall to fit under a standard cabinet and does pour out very slowly. but as for the cleaning, it's not anymore than cleaning out a grinder and coffee pot individually each day - and i think it's worth it!!  i really am enjoying this coffee pot and i just don't mind the extra cleaning because the flavor is absolutely worth it!!!

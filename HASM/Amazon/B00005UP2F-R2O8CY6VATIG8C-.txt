Title: A Happy Housewife!
Content:
We live in a recreational vehicle - size, space and function are always issues. I have been a canister vac user for many years and have NEVER been so pleased with a vacuum cleaner. The POWER, ease of use, retractable cord, variable suction control, attachments and power nozzle were enough to sell me on this vacuum. All of this in a compact unit! I am a clean-aholic and was blown away at how much this vacuum cleaner sucked up from my 'clean' carpet! The filter is a bit messy, but once you use this vacuum cleaner you'll agree....it's worth a bit of inconvenience to know you have clean carpets and floors!

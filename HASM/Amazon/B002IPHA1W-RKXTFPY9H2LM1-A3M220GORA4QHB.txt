Title: Waiting for a new one!
Content:
I have the 8gb and I can't stress enough to anybody how this beats out the Zune and iPod. I made a mistake purchasing the 8gb when I really need the 16gb, but I really don't mind since it's affordable. The sound is A+, videos A, speakers B+, Portability A+. It's the perfect device, I urge mp3 fanatics to stay away from the mainstream items, you'd think I'd be amazed at the new nano that shoots video, but another eye roller. Only problem I have though is that Amazon has yet to lower the price on this, come on? A couple of cents saved? Try 5 or 6 dollars.

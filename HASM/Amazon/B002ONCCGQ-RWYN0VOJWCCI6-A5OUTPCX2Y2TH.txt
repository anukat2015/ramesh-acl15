Title: I'm impressed with the quality of this laptop!
Content:
I've had my new HP 1030-US laptop computer for a couple of days and have been loving every minute of it. As I type this review I'm immediately thinking of how solid the construction feels, the keys have a great feel, very much like that of a MacBook, and the screen is bright and clear. Interestingly, it has no cd/dvd drive and I'm not missing it. Windows 7 is fantastic, and I feel fortunate to have skipped Vista. 
A couple of things that are kind of crummy include the mouse pad which is sexy looking, but not sexy acting. It has crashed the computer a couple of times and just generally seems to be too sensitive or plain buggy. The screen is nice, but awfully reflective. I've found that sitting with my back to a window is very difficult with the glare. 
I recommend it for mobile users and professional users. I got mine for $499. Tough to beat that value.

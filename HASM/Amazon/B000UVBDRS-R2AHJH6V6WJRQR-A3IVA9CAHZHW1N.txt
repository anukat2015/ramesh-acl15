Title: My New Creative Zen is awesome!
Content:
I've been debating getting this for a while, because I had a working player, and couldn't see my way to spending the money on another one, when I really didn't need it.  Well..... I finally did anyway, and I love it! 
The design is really cool, and it's easy to use.  I love that it can also hold videos, pictures, and that it has personal organizer capabilities, so it can hold your calender information, schedule, contacts, etc...  It's very helpful.
Creative has made a great product!

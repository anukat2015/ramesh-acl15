Title: love it
Content:
I just ordered two more of these units. We've been using them for the last five years or so and love them! We need more because we keep giving them away to our kids, who ask for them specifically. They run quieter and put out more heat (double ceramic heater) than any other fan driven area heater we've ever used. We also love the thermostat features and tip-over shut off. I don't think Holmes is making this model any more and it's a shame. I thought I better get a few more while I can.

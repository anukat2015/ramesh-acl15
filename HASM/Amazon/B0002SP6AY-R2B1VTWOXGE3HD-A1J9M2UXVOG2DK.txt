Title: unintuitive --- I don't recommend
Content:
I've owned many programmables over the years and I have to say this is the most unintuitive model I've ever had.  I bought it because of the hours usage feature, which most other brands lack.  However, that feature is not enough to make up for the difficulty of use.  The principal issue is entering a "hold" mode.  For starters, you have to go inside the cover to access "hold".  Then it's easy to exit the mode as you're trying to adjust the temp.
Also, the "set" temperature is not displayed on the default display.  You have to briefly hit the up or down button button to make it flash up on the display.  But of course, if you press and hold it too long, you start to change the actual set temperature.  And this is just a partial list of nuances that I expect will bug the average user.
If you're on top of it and tech savvy, you can navigate these issues.  But when my parents visit and I need to deviate from the standard program, for instance, it's hopeless to instruct them on these nuances, so I have to take on all programming responsibility.
But to be fair, it's not particularly difficult to initially program and install.  It's just the other day-to-day interaction that is lacking.
I highly recommend the Honeywell Electronic Focus Programmable Thermostat #YRTH6300B1007 (a 5/2, but I'm sure a 7-day model exists).  It is much more user friendly than the Hunter.
Too bad, as I'm generally a fan of Hunter products.  But this one just isn't up to the task.

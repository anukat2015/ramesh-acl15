Title: A decent heater
Content:
I have found this heater to be almost too good.  I don't have a lot of space near my desk and on only the 400W level it almost feels like it's burning my leg!  My desk is right under a tall window and my legs get cold but I've found if I point the heater towards the wall, the radiant heat bounces off and keeps my legs reasonably warm.  I usually only use it first thing in the morning while my office heats up with an oil-filled heater.  I plan on taking this heater home for my wife and daughter to try out as they are always cold.  The unit has a timer that is handy and it also swivels.  The construction seems to be of average quality.

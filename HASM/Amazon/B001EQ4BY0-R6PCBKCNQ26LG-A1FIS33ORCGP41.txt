Title: Such a disappointment
Content:
I have owned the 20D for years and was excited to upgrade to this model. I could not be more disappointed with this camera. I believe it is a problem with the camera itself. Maybe a different one would work better but regardless I'm sending this camera back and I'm purchasing the Rebel t1i instead. It feels odd to move down a step but having used the Rebel t1i I can say it takes 100% better pictures than my 50D. 
The pictures on the 50D come out grainy and flat. There is not the sharp, crisp quality that you'd expect to find from a semi professional level camera. I am using L series lenses to no avail. The picture quality is just sub par. I read the negative reviews on this camera and figured I'd take the chance since there were so many positives but I should have listened to those who had issues and not made the purchase in the first place. I would not recommend this camera at all.

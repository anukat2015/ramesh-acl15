Title: Great Purchase.
Content:
The complaint previous reviewers have mentioned regarding the carpet attachment's design flaw in only rotating in one direction is quite accurate and infuriating.  The power cord is also about 15' too short.  Other than that, this is the best vacuum ever.  It's quiet, powerful, and versatile.  What else could you ask for?

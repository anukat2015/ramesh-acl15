Title: Reasonable Happy Ipod/apple fan
Content:
This is my third ipod.  I decided it was time for a new ipod when the technology changed and improved with the added feature of a radio, pedometer, tag song technology, and more capacity.  I also like it for keeping track of my mileage when I can get that feature to work.  To use the mileage tracking feature for running you have to purchase a transmitter & sensor.  In addition, to the sensor which cost $29.99, you need a pair of nike plus shoes($100.00) and an armband ($29.00).  You don't need the shoes if you purchase a pouch ($5.00) for your sensor which can be laced up on any pair of sneakers.  I'm an apple fan, that suffers with some of the inoperable overpriced features.

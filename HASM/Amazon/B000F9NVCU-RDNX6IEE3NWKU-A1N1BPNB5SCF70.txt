Title: Great buy
Content:
This laptop was purchased back in 2006 for 500$ and it's still running strong. It's definitely not a high-end laptop (so no gaming or video-editing) but it handles online/wireless connections very well, has very few compatibility issues, and performs all the basic tasks that I, a student, need it to do. I haven't had an issue with the screen/keyboard/touchpad or really any other aspect of the hardware. It's a solid little machine.

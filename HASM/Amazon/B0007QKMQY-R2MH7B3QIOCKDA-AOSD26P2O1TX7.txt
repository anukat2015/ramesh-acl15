Title: Works like a charm!
Content:
This is my first digital SLR camera and I was a bit hesitant at first to spend almost $500 on a camera. However, it was well worth the amount. I've had a lot of fun with this little camera and I've already taken some pretty amazing shots. It's real user friendly. A real small body so it's easy to travel with and the battery power is outstanding. I will purchase a different lens soon. The one that comes with the body is alright if I had to rate that I'd probably give it three and a half stars. I've had a real hard time with trying to focus on people with that lens when trying to take portraits. Other than than that it creates sharp images. I suggest this to anyone who is new to the digital SLR cameras.
enjoy!

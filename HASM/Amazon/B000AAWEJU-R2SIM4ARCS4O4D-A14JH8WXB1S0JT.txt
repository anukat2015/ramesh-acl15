Title: happy pet owner
Content:
The Carina is lightweight and has great suction.  I don't have carpet, but the upholstery tool does a good job of getting cat & dog hair off my upholstered furniture.  It's easy to move around and doesn't take up a lot of space.  At first having the exhaust on top bothered me (it blows into my face at times) but I'm used to it now.  I'm sure it's clean air, being all HEPA filtered and everything.

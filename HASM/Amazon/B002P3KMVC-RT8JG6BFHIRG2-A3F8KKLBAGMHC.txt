Title: Defective keyboard.
Content:
I ordered this laptop after reading thre reviews people wrote about. It is in fact a very sleek machine. However, to my frustration, upon receiving it, I noticed the left control key keeps jamming and clicking almost everytime I click on it. Sometimes it doesn't and seems normal, but then it comes back up again and clicks or/and jams.
Plus, the battery does not last 10-12 hours and I am having to recharge it at almost every 5-7 hours despite only using to watch videos and type texts.

Title: Very Good Internet and Media device
Content:
I am using it with Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), works very good and automatically chooses between windows media device and linux/macos access, reproduces lots more content than the iPod (I gave goodbye to mine) but I hope they increase the number of available applications and open the devices SDK so people can start developing more good stuff for the platform.
For those geeks who buy it, it has great support for Widgets and Flash applications, just built your own and load it into the device.
Have Fun,
Mark.

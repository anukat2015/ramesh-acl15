Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
Impressed with the quality of the product, i.e. metal where others are plastic, including parts of hose.  Not too noisy at all.  (But still scares the dogs, which is good!)  Excellent power.  Very lightweight.  Cord has good reach.  Paid a little more than the low-end, but seems to be a great value overall.  Note:  Did come with one bag, which is nice, but then the question is, where do you get replacement bags?

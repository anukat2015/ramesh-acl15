Title: Poor Build Quality
Content:
I have had the Y550 for over six months now.  There are some design flaws.  For example the L-shaped power plug interferes with the the DVD tray.  The USB ports are mounted on the sides but near the front.  This interferes when using a mouse.  My battery is already shot -- not lasting more than 30 minutes.  I might as well have bought a desktop computer.  The hinges on the top are also starting to get too loose so the screen flops around a lot.  The glossy finish inside and out is impossible to keep clean.  IBM used to make solid computers.  Something seems to have been lost when they sold their laptop business.

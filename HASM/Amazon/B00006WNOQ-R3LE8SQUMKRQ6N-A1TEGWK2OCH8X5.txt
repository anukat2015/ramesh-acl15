Honeywell HZ-315 Ceramic Heater
Greetings to whom it may concern. I purchased two of these HZ-315 ceramic heaters on January 28, 2009. Both vibrated across a smooth hard floor surface, very unsafe behavior for an electrical heating appliance. It was too costly to ship back even though they said they'd waive the return fee at customer service. Heater #1 failed on March 20th, didn't even last 2 months. I would advise to steer clear of this model, it's not the quality product you'd expect from a company like Honeywell and doesn't appear to be built to last either. The company I bought it from was very professional and timely, I did not contact them for a replacement. I wouldn't have wanted it anyway.

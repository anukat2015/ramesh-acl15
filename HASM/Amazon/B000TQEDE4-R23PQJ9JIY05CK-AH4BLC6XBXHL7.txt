Title: Makes OK coffee, but...
Content:
We have the coffeemaker on the counter under kitchen cabinets, but the cord is so short you cannot get the unit all the way out.  This makes it difficult and awkward to open the top and pour water.  Also, the carafe top is very difficult to grasp and remove.

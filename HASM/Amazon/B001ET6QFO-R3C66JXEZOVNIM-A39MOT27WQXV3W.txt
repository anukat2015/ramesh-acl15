Title: Canon 50D is all that!
Content:
Former Sony A100 user never was quite happy with the Sony quality overall after 3 yrs. 
I decided to become a Canon Gal this past September 09! 
Now there is no turning back! 
I use my equipment professionally and for personal as well. 
I can't wait to upgrade in 2 yrs for the 5DMII cause if the results from a crop are this good I can imagine with the full frame! 
Absolutely recommend this to anyone, if not the 50D, any Canon will do.

Title: fantstic camera!
Content:
great camera! solid build, very intuitive menus and controls, great images and high ISO capacity (after the new software update v4), and camera based sensor stabilization - all your lenses - including the old minotas that you can grab for cheap on ebay will be stabilized! (as opposed o paying premium prices to canon and nikon! at this price I am considering getting a second one!

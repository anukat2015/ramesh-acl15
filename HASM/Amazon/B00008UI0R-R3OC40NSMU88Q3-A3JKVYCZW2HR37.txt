Title: Lifts dirt long hidden
Content:
I had been using an upright vac for my small carpeted area and a shop vac for all else until I tired of lugging two machines around.  This machine fills both functions, saves on storage space and has a lot of features that make use especially easy.  The ability to increase the suction really surprised me.  The machine virtually pulled itself across the carpet on the third setting and dragged tons of dirt my old machine had just skimmed over.  THe ability to extend the wand with a simple click enables one to get to the top of drapes or all the way under the sofa. 
 
Empting the dirt container does have to be done more frequently than is necessary with a bagged vac.  I do it outside to avoid any stray dust settling back in the house.  A small brush is included to clean the folds of the filter but the Shop Vac comes in handy again for this.  
There's a nice assortment of attachments but only a few store on the canister itself.  The powered upholstry brush really lifted the dust from my chairs and sofa.  
All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.

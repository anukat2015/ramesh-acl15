Title: this little thing rocks!
Content:
you can't beat the price and all this little thing does and plays.  for the buck, you get a lot of memory, more if you get the card to fit it, but still plenty if you don't.  plus radio.  plus recording.  plus plus plus.  some reviews sassed its battery life, but i disagree with those reviews; i listen to mine several hours a day and charge it about once or twice a week - that's not bad at all.  when i play it via a converter on real speakers, it doesn't drain the battery life too much either and i can play it all day without interruption.  
the sound quality is quite good, enhanced with a little equalizer adjustment.  so is the volume.  so is the capacity.  my vote is for this very portable, affordable, ear-friendly little player.  kudos!

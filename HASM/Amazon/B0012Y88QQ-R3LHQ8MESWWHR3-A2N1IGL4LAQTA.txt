Title: Great Camera
Content:
This is my first dive into the DSLR realm.  I really like this camera, it has plenty of options for more advanced users, but is simple enough that I can hand it to a novice and they can take nice pics right away (with the right settings).  The optical image stabilization is very cool, really helps on indoors shots and etc (turn it off if u use a tripod tho b/c it will soften long exposure shots).  I could be wrong about this but it seems as though there is no way to Auto focus while using the camera in "Live view" mode.  But I don't really use that ever so it doesn't really bother me.  12 mp is very large, I've found the real limiting factor to clarity shifts from being how many pixels to how clear your focus is your lighting and what ISO / exposure / etc you have set.  I compared this camera to the Sony Alpha 16mp and decided to go with this one because of the optical image stabilization and after reading reviews, the menu system on the Sony didn't seem as nice.  Having never used the Alpha I can't really say the XSI is definitely better but I'm happy with my decision.  The kit lens works well for many situations but can't really zoom in very far, so you will probably find yourself wanting something like the 50-250mm IS lens soon after you buy the camera if you are into things like nature photography etc where u can't get very close to the subject.  I've taken about a thousand pics so far, the battery life is really good if u don't use flash constantly or leave the window on for extended periods it will last for many hundreds of pictures.
     Overall I would recommend this camera, it is nicely priced takes large very nice pics and the kit lens comes with IS so thumbs up from me.

Title: Great Little Computer
Content:
In the course of the past 12 years I have used 8 different laptown computers for work.  The brands include Gateway, IBM, Compaq in the early days and within the last few years primarily Dell.  My last work computer was a Dell Latitude 600 which I really liked, primarily for it's size.  Most of my work was on the road so the computer size was the most important consideration.  When I retired a year ago I was fortunate enough to have my company give me the Latitude which runs great.  The only problem is the 40 GB HD and 1 GB Ram.  I have been looking at getting a netbook, but have been waiting for Windows 7 to come out.  However, the other day while at Office Depot I spotted the DV-2 1030US and it immediately caught my eye for it's size...plus a lot more powerful than a netbook..it was on sale for $[...].  Well I immediately went home and checked the internet for reviews and prices.  The reviews were not all positive but many were; also I found that Staples had them on sale for $[...] with the $[...] rebate.  Well it has now been 6 days and I am totally amazed at this little machine.  It is just the right size and the speed seems very good.  I will not go through all the positives and negatives that have been mentioned in other reviews, for the most part they are right on.  What I am saying is that this little computer so far is perfect for my needs, bascially, small, fast and portable.

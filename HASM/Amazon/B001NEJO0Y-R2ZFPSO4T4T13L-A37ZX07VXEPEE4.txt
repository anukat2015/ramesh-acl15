Title: No regrets
Content:
This is my first "my own" personal laptop I bought.  I was impressed with the performance of a Toshiba laptop I used at work, so I naturally took interest when Toshiba was having these great deals and people were writing up great reviews.  I've used laptops for work, but I wouldn't say I am an expert when it comes to tweaking the machine.  So I am now using it with all the "bloat wares" people have been writing about.
15.4" screen is large enough to allay my fear of haunching over the machine.  My wife's 14.1" made my neck and shoulder so painful that I thought of going with a 17", but now I don't regret going with 15.4".  I don't know what an expert would say, but I am happy with the quality of the screen.  I watched a few episodes of "Lost" and it was good enough for me.
4GB provides more than enough memory to run a few large excel files simultaneously and browse the internet.  
The sound is just beautiful for a laptop.  
The exterior?  Fantastic.  I mean, it's just so pretty to look at.  The smudge and finger prints?  I think only those with OCD would fret over it.
I wish the case wasn't plastic.  But what can you expect for this price?
First time buyer?  Don't be scared.  Buy it.

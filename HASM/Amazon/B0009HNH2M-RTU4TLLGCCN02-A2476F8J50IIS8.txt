Title: Vacuum breaks down at first dust bunny
Content:
I made a resolution to buy a canister vacuum for my cleaning lady who uses my heavy upright for everthing. I have lots of pet hair in two wood floored rooms.
It worked great on the floor but when it hit the two carpeted stairs, the fan belt came off. It took 30 minutes to open up the power head to replace the belt. I gave up and plan to return this to the store. It is one week old and had never been used.
I shopped for an inexpensive lightweight $119 model but will probably go back to Sears for the Dyson.  The cord is too short and when you carry the canister in your left hand, your hip will shut off the power button.
It's very poorly made and will never withstand the heavy use of the cleaning people.

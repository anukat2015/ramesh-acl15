Title: Mr. Coffee 8 cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker
Content:
I was somewhat disappointed in this product.  It makes good coffee but it is slow and loud.  Also, you have to put hot water in the thermal pot and let it stand for 5 minutes before you start the coffee so the pot stays warm.  If you don't do this the coffee cools off fairly quickly.  Also, there are two holes in the back of the water reservior of the machine that if you are not very careful pouring the water in, it will splash out all over the counter. A somewhat strange design.

Title: Perfect heater !!!
Content:
I bought this heater three weeks ago for my small room ( i was literally dying of cold)and i haven't regretted it one bit. It warms up very fast and the 360 degree function makes it heat up my entire room pretty quickly.The heater however emanates a 'heating smell' when its turned on, which you have to get used to.I strongly recommend this heater for anyone with a small room because of its safety features and performance.

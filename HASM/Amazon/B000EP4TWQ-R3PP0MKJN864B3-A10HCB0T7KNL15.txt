Title: Excellent Product --
Content:
I love this product.  I am a runner and use it on all my runs.  It is lightweight and holds enough music to keep my long distance runs less boring.  I've also purchased the Nike+ sensor, along with Nike+ sneakers to help me with my training.  It is the best thing I could have done--there are songs put together thru iTunes that can help you train to run faster and stronger.  And finally, you can download all your runs/progress onto [...] to see your progress.  It is highly recommended!

Title: Very Attractive Looking Laptop, Decent Specs, but not without flaws
Content:
What I really did like:
 - Touchpad & Keyboard are phenomenal; On par with even Apple's offerings.
 - Extremely good looking build & casing. Feels sturdy.
 - Bright LCD screen
 - Feels lighter than usual for a 14.1' laptop
 - Decent specs for work & home (2.0GHz 2xCore, 4GB PC2-6400 DDR2, GMA 45000 HD, 1280 x 800, 800MHz bus, 250GB harddrive)
 - Built in MemoryStick reader
What i really didn't like:
 - Touch Pad buttons are "clacky" - By this, I mean the click sound is a bit loud.
 - Battery life good, but not great.
 - Media Key touch sensitivity a bit off at times.
 - Sub-par gaming performance; Non-discrete video.
 - Ridiculous amount of bloatware that you'll have to remove. Besides the 30 SW packages that Sony provided, there was the Google Toolbar, QuickenBooks, Live OneSupport, MS Works, a trial of MS Office, Roxio, Adobe Air/Flash/Reader, ArcSoft Camera software, WinDVD and about a dozen other things (Java, VC++ Redistributable, MSXML, etc...)
BTW: My purchase was the White version of the same model.

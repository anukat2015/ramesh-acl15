Title: Excellent pot, one drawback
Content:
I bought this pot because it was rated #1 by the leading consumer testing organization.  Very happy with it.  Just wish it had an external fill level indicator as did my old Mr Coffee.  With that addition it would be perfect.  We fill ours with the sink sprayer, and its difficult to see into the fill tank to see level you're at.

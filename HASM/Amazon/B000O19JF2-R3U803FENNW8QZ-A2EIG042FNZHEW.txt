Title: This camera fulfilled all my expectations!!!
Content:
I have always love photography but I never had the chance to buy a good camera (I live in Colombia and buying a camera is really expensive). Before my Nikon D40X I had two digital cameras (canon and kodak), and I  was always dissapointed because of the limited features they have. Nowadays, with my Nikon d40x I finally found out a camera that helps me to take the pictures that I want to, and no those that the camera is able to. 
It has several features that are easy to use, even for an amateur like myself. I have tried in both landscape and inside pictures and the result is always amazing. The only issue that may be dissapointing for amateur digital cameras users (after using this camera you get use to it) is that you cannot see the picture in the LCD screen while shooting. You have to shoot and wait til you can see it in the screen. It is not a big deal, when having a camera that takes such perfect pictures. 
When I was planning to buy a new SLR camera I did not know for sure how to choose between the Canon Rebel XTI and Nikon D40X, but after reading a thousand comments in so many web pages,I made my decision and fortunately it was not the wrong one.
If you want to get into photography, I am more than confident that this camera is an excelent choise.

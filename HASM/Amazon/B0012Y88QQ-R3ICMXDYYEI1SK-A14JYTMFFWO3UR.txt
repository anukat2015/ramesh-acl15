Title: Light & Strong
Content:
I love this camera-- I have worked with a lot of Canon cameras--and this one is right up there with the Canon 40d. It is light and easy to shoot with. The only thing that I was suprised with is that it doesn't have a compact flash drive, which is the first Canon camera I have used to have that. But it hasn't been an inconvenience, and it works great.

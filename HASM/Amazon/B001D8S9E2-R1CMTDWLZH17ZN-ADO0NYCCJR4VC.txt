Title: Don't expect this to actually be what apple is selling now - "new"
Content:
i purchased this computer yesterday, and since i was "lucky" enough to get one manufactured last year, i did not get the ilife 09 upgrade advertised on the apple.com website => http://www.apple.com/macbook/software.html.
Granted the Amazon.com page does say ilife '08, but this machine is now almost SIX months old and it doesnt have recent software?!
The Apple support were helpful enough to offer to sell me ilife 09 for $79.

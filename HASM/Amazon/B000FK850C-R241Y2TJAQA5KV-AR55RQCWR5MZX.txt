Title: a wonderful addition
Content:
after reading all sorts of reviews on products, I decided to give this a try.  I have a bedroom in our finished basement that tends to be a little chilly during the winter time and have been looking for a good heater to help keep it a little warmer.  I've had the heater for a few weeks now and am actually looking to get another one.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  within a fairly short time 5-10 min approx. it took a 12x18 room and took it from 61 to 70 degrees.  I tried it in our family room(15x32) downstairs this past weekend and left it down there for a couple hours while we were upstairs doing stuff and came down to watch a movie on our big screen in a very warm comfortable setting.  Dynamite truly comes in small packages.  great product and I love the safety features as well.

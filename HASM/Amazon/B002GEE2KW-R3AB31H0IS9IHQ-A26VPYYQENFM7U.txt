Title: can't beat the price
Content:
I really haven't had a chance to use the unit since it is still winter but i have tried it.  as far as i can tell, it works great.  it doesn't take up a large amount of space in my sunroom where it gets quite hot during the summer months.  the only "complaint" i have was it's shipping. i was very concerned since there wasn't any padding.  however, it doesn't look like anything was broken

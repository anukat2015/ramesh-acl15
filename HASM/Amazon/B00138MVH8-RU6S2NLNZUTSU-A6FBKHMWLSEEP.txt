Title: Works Great
Content:
Specifically bought the body only for use with my Minolta AF lens from my film Maxxum 9000 days.  Been wanting a dslr for a few years and finally did the dirty deed.  Had a great opportunity to 'learn' this past week in the Eastern Sierra.  It's one of those practice, practice, practice learning curves, but love the results thus far.  If anyone's interested in the pix they can go to promoguy.smugmug.com and check out the pix in the gallery Eastern Sierra.  Took me until the last couple of days to get the purpose of ae but once I did, it make a world of difference.
And while I'm at it, may a give a big shout out to onecall.com who amazon partnered with.

Title: SIMPLY LOVE IT!
Content:
I received my Ipod Classic 80GB yesterday and I love it!  I upgraded my 4th generation 20GB Ipod and love the simplicity and oustanding video that the Ipod Classic delivers.  I contemplated buying the Ipod Touch, but was afraid that I would bang it up taking it to the gym and everyday use and $400.00 is a little too steep to shell out for an Ipod with only 16GB although the features are impressive.  Right out of the box, the Ipod Classic is very user friendly in syncing with Itunes which I love.  
Not having a video Ipod before, I am very impressed and glad that I waited for the 6th generation Ipod.

Title: Review,but a question
Content:
This is a powerful hand held vacuum. I have a question for anyone that has this vacuum and has cats and dogs. What have you found  is the easiest way to get the hair out of the revolving brush? I have a long haired cat. The Shark really picks up the hair, but I find it hard to get the hair out of the brushes. I have tried an old tooth brush and tweezers.I am amazed how well this thing picks up.

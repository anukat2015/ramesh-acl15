Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
Consumer Reports rated this one best and I have had this vacuum for about 2 months now.  It hasn't disapppointed.  It works great and is truly a great design.  I love that the floor cleaner pops in and out of the power brush.  All the controls are at your fingertips.  It is a little on the expensive side but with all the great features it is understandable.  I got mine at Sears for a little less than Amazon wants.  The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is I wish it had more suction.  There is a suction control but even with it closed all the way and turned up completely once in a while it isn't quite enough.  I also wish it had more control when you are pulling the canister behind you but this is common with canisters.  I would absolutely recommend this vacuum to anyone!

Title: I love this camera!
Content:
My only complaint is the weight and size of the camera body-- it is certainly smaller than some of the higher end 'professional models,' but i was led to believe by the photos and other reviews that this would be a compact little dslr, which it really isn't.   But it's great.  Takes great macro shots, and is ready to go out of the box (after you attach the lens, of course).  Also great that different lenses can be used.  I have yet to explore it's full potential, but i'm happy with my purchase.

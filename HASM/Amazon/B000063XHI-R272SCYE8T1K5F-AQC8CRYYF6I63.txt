Title: Finally a hot cup of coffee
Content:
Is it so much to ask?  A hot cup of coffee in a thermal carafe, clock/timer and simple/dependable operation.  Well, one would think so after looking at and buying a number of these coffee makers.  So, it was nice to finally find a decent coffee maker.  Expensive, yes.  But it brews hot coffee and keeps it hot for long enough.

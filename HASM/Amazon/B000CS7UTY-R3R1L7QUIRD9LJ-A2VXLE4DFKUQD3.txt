Title: great buy
Content:
As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck. While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file. I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file. Apple is up front about their capacity. For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer). Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive. Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M. Take your pick. 
to clear that up  it holds 15000 128kb WMA files, which are evedently half the quality of mp3, but i can tell no difference.

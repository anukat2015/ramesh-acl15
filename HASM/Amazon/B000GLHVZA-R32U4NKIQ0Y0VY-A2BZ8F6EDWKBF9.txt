Title: would not recommend
Content:
had it for three days in my office and while it was "okay" at heating the motor quickly broke and started rattling loudly. what steams me is that Vornados cost 2X comparable products and so would expect higher quality control -- pay a premium and still have to return to get one that works? no way. Bought a Lasko 755320 Ceramic Tower for 1/2 price and so far very happy with it.

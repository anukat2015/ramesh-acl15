Title: Very, very good
Content:
Very briefly, what would have been my first doubt: yes, it uses the same sensor as the XTi, but also: yes: the image quality IS better then the XTi. Images are smoother, they post-process much better. Bigger viewfinder alone was enough to make me happy for getting it. Handling is great, only wish the buttons below the LCD were different color or marked better, in dim light they tend to disappear. It's big, heavy and solid, a joy to use.

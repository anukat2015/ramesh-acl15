Title: The best heater ever
Content:
This is a great unit and just like it states it is wisper quiet.  Easy to read digital temp. Took about 5 min to warm a 63 degree room to 72!  Takes up little space, I put mine in the corner and you don't even know its there. It is also an attractive unit that I don't mind having in any room of the house.  The remote controol is a plus also. I Did not think I needed it, but now that I have it, I love that feature also.  There is an easy to use timer on the unit also.  That is a nice feature so you don't forget to turn it off when you go to work etc.  I am thinking about ordering another one as this is such a handy unit.  With heating costs this winter it is a money saver to use this electric unit to supplement your heat.

Title: great heater
Content:
I use it to heat a bathroom and it does a great job gets very hot.  Seems like its very hot to the touch so I'd keep it away from children and pets. Put it in the living room for a little while as I waited for a large back ordered infared heater, it did a pretty good job in the larger area too

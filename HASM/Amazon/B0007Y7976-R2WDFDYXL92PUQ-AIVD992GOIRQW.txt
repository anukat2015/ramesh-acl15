Title: The 4GB Nano Versus the Video models
Content:
I was torn as to which one I should buy, the video one or the Nano. The video model is not much more in price than this one and holds a lot more songs, but I thought it would be too big and bulky for the gym. I'm happy with this one, being that the size is perfect. I also don't really have a need to watch movies or TV shows on a portable device. The main reason for this purchase was for music, and with a capacity of 1,000 songs that is plenty enough for me.

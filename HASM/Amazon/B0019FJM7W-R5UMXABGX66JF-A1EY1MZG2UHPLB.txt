Title: Nice camera, very pleased
Content:
This is a great camera for the price. I have had it for about 2 months now. It feels really good in my hand, which I could not say with the same with the D60 or Cannon XS series. In-body IS works well. Autofocus is reasonably fast. Auto exposure works well, even with the annoying flash turned off (it uses the flash to get the white balance I believe). Lots of configuration options. Image quality is excellent.
Downside: The included software isn't the most fully featured however.
I don't know much about SLRs and am getting my feet wet. This is my first and I am not disappointed. I just shoot in auto mode and it does a very good job. Way better then a point and shoot, and a lot more fun to use.

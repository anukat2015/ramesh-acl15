Title: Not Worth The Money Don't Buy
Content:
I bought this for my son as an anniversary present and ended up giving him the money instead. Heater is a joke but I am not laughing. I am angry at myself for not reading more reviews before I shelled out money for this product. Going to send it back and try to recoup some of the money. My son is the only one who won out because I had to give him the reciept in case he wanted to return it and he saw the price so he ended up with $400.00 the price of the heater when I bought it back from him. Edenpure Heaters will leave you cold.

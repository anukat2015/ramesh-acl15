Title: Keurig is the best thing since sliced bread!
Content:
Day to day, we have been loving this coffee maker. As a decaf/regular family, we can now make exactly what we want in the size and strength we prefer without any waste whatsoever. Last night, we had our first dinner party and were able to serve everyone what they wanted in less time than it would have taken us to brew the separate pots and teas.
We love it!

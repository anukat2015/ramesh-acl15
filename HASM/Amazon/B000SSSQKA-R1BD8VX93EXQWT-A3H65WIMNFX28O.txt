Title: Good Value for the Money
Content:
I bought this vacuum based on the other reviews.  I am not disappointed, this vacuum has a ton of power - but it's not easy to push the hose and vacuum around on rugs - I have to turn the power down.  So - it's powerful, but does not glide easily over rugs.  I have thick oriental rugs, so I don't know if that's the issue.  But, I would recommend it for the hardwood floors.

Title: Stopped Functioning After one Season
Content:
I used this product in my bedroom for one season with great success.  It kept my room toasty warm.  However after a few days into my second winter it stopped working completely.  I checked other reviews on Amazon and this does seem to be a common issue.  Now that the warrenty is up I don't know what to do.  I am disappointed with this purchase!

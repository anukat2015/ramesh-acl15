Title: I SHOT TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS!!!
Content:
With my camera of course.  I am in the Navy as a photojournalist serving on board a ship.  My job entails me to shoot a lot and I mean a lot of photos.  I am actually using the 300D model of this particular SLR and have had nothing but fun shooting this camera.  The shots that I have been able to produce have been nothing short of spectacular.  The crisp vibrant colors and the many features on this camera have been amazing.  I recommend this camera to anybody who wants to start out in the wonderful world of photography.  I am looking forward to using this camera out in the civilian sector of my job.  Oh by the way, if you are wondering which two presidents I have shot with this camera they were Presidents George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton while they came aboard to thank my many shipmates for our part in the humanitarian relief efforts that took place earlier this year to help the victims of the December 26th tsunamis.

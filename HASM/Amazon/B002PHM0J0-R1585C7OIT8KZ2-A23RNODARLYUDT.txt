Title: Awesome laptop
Content:
This VAIO laptop is simply awesome. Bought it during Black Friday and have been using it ever since with no problems. Boots up in less than a minute and the cool thing is you can start the web browser without booting up Windows. This is very useful while travelling and when the laptop is shutdown. Windows 7 looks impressive and very responsive.
My requirement was photo and video editing. It comes with Vaio Movie Story (a very easy to use movie creation tool). I can now edit my AVCHD video files (from my Sony camcorder) and create beautiful home movies.
The NVDIA grahics accelerator card is great to play the AVCHD videos. I dont see any jerky motion. 
So far very satisifed with this laptop. It is closest to the MAC that you can get at half the price.

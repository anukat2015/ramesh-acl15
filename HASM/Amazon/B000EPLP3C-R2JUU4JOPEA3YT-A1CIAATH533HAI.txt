Title: Zune: very disappointing!
Content:
Just like a lot of us I bought one of these, thinking that it would be better than the Ipod (bigger screen etc.). I use Microsoft Vista, and first of all the device is not recognized, so I try to download the drivers and no luck, it simply doesn't work under Vista. So I go to my wife's windows XP machine and I start fiddling with it, after few unsuccessful tries (hours!) I am finally able to listen to my own songs from Zune.
Zune's interface is clearly not as good as the Ipod, the Ipod does make sense and it's a no brainer, the creators of Zune probably focussed on getting the Zune as cheap as they could so they can hope to make a few sales so they didn't focus on the interface, and/or computer support. After hours wasted I understood that the Zune is completely unusable and I will not wait 6 months that Microsoft releases a patch for it to somewhat make it work. I am returning it to the store today to get an Ipod, it's a no brainer, the Ipod is the same price and WORKS.
If you are thinking about buying one of these, then don't. Get an Ipod.

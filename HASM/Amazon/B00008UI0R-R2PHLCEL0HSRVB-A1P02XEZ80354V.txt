Title: Not a winner
Content:
Ordered - used a few times and returned.
The belt that drives the brushes kept slipping off.
Called Hoover, they referred me to service center hundreds of miles away.
They said belts usually have to be replaced 2-3 times a year as they expand with use. They determined from the serial # of the machine that it was manufactured 11/07 - bought 8/08 - belt may have deteriorated just sitting there.
The belt drive is not well designed - no ridge or collar to keep it on drive shaft.
Looking for something more reliable.
Amazon return experience very good (haven't seen refund yet) and easy to ship if you have a big enough box

Title: Excellent Camera - no regrets except poor packaging by amazon.com
Content:
The camera is very good, from the ones I have seen with friends.  Unfortunately, the one I ordered was delivered to me by amazon.com in a very sloppy packaging. The entire camera box was bouncing in the larger case, as amazon.com did not place adequate padding on the inside.  They were kind enough to return it, though.  I would have preferred a much better packaging.

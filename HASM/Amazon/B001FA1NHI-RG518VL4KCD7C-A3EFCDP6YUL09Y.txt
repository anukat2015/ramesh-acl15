Title: It is Worthy!
Content:
I needed an IPOD for exercise.  I didn't like using my CLASSIC because it was too big.  I had tried three other MP3 players (all battery powered) and I didn't like the battery life.  The Nano's battery life is perfect.  I workout 6 days a week for 1 1/2 hours and I don't have to charge weekly...I simply opt to charge.    Accessories purchased makes it a perfect addition to successful workouts.

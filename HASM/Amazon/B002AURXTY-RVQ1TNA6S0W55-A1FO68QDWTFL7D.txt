Title: Amazing machine for the money
Content:
I bought the Acer Timeline because I just got rid of my MacBook with the intention of buying a MacBook Air. I stumbled across the Timeline and decided that with the cost (roughly 1/3 the price), it would be worth it to try the Timeline. It has turned out to be an awesome machine. I miss MacOSX, but Windows Vista works pretty well. The only drawback is the processor speed. However, the processor itself is a bonus. It is a low-energy processor, so I'm able to use this machine for a long time on a single charge (I've gone up to 9 hours while running FireFox, and up to 8 hours while running Word and MediaPlayer at the same time). So in my opinion, the slower processor is well worth it.

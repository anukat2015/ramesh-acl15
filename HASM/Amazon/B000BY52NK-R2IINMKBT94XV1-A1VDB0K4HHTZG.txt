Title: Great Camera
Content:
I am always a Canon user and buy this one for my father who is Nikon user. So I tried this camera before giving it to my dad. It is a great camera, I should say. Color performance is much better than D100 and other Nikon camera. It gives you a solid feeling when holding it in hands. Very good materials.
You won't regret it no matter you are canon person or nikon person. It gives you a lot of fun on photography.

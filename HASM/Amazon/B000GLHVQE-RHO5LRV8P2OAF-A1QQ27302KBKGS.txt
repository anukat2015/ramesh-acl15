Title: great product, great price
Content:
I purchased this heater for my sunroom. I love it. After reading some of the reviews I was expecting to be a little disappointed. However, the fire does look real ( unless you are right on it, staring). It provides an excellent source of heat. There are two temperatures and I keep it on low. the heater has reduced my eletric bill and I would recommend it to anyone. excellent for the price. Mel atl, ga

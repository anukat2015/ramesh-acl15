Title: Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2
Content:
Have only used for a month, but so far it's as good as the old Canon Rebel 35 mm I had.  I've been waiting for the price to drop enough to convert to a SLR and always wanted another Rebel.  Easy to use, so far the pictures are excellent and they expand to 8x10s beautifully!  Got the zoom lens to go with - have been very impressed with the range, the action shots, and the low lighting pictures!

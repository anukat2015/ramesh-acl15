Title: Never had a chance
Content:
After only 3 weeks and very minimal use my hard drive died.  I had to pay to send it back to Asus via an authorized dealer so they could swap out the hard drive. Luckily there was a dealer in my area because I was unable to get in contact with anyone at Asus, after trying for days.  When I finally received the laptop back, the sound was no longer working.  I tried once again to get in contact with Asus but was unsuccessful.  I called the authorized dealer who could not help me over the phone and now I need to bring it back in and possible send it back to Asus.  This has been, hands down, the worst experience I have ever had post purchase.  I will never buy an Asus product again and will discourage everyone I know from doing the same.  Painful.

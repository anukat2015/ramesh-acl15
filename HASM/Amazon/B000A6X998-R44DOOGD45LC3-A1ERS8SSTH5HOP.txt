Title: Worst heater I have ever had
Content:
This heater has had a very short life with me (less than a year), and it has just suddenly died.  From the very beginning it was the most peculiar heater I have ever had.  I had previously owned a Holmes radiant heater that was not digital, and when it died (it didn't live that long either!) I got this one.  What a huge disappointment!  It seems as if they made everything completely non-intuitive.  It is very noisy at start up (but so was the previous model), the bar on the front gets very hot which is extremely dangerous because the tendency is to use it as a handle (I have burns to prove it), and turning it off is the most un-intuitive thing I have ever seen.  You have to hold down the button while it goes to the highest heat (makes you think you did it wrong) before it shuts off.  Though I liked the model they had before this one, this is a real dud.  After I finally got used to all its peculiarities, today the heating element went.  But perhaps just as well.  I have been very unhappy with this fan since the beginning.

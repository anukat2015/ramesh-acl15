Title: Its not the computer, its the software..Vista that sucks.
Content:
I have an Apple and a Sony Vaio using Windows XL that will stream HD Baseball from www.mlb.com. Not with Vista. Vista wouldn't even reconize my plug and play HP printers. Apple and Windows XL did.
My recommendation is don't even think about buying a new computer until Windows 7 is available.

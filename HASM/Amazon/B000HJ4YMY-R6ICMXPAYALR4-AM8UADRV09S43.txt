Title: Lens problems with the D80
Content:
We are sending back our 2nd D80 now.  The lens keeps coming 'detached' and won't take pictures.  You have to take it off and put it back on again.  It works for awhile and then indicates that it is detached.  Nikon indicated they never have had this problem before (despite this being the 2nd incident with us).  For a very expensive camera - this is quite frustrating.

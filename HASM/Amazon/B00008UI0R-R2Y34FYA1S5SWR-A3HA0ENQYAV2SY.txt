Title: Seems like a Good Choice
Content:
Good Vacuum for the price. Sucks real good. Adjustable suction lets you control how much or how little. Bagless is convenient but a little dirty- i empty outside. What?? no beater bar height adjustment?? Seems to be set real low- cleans rugs well, but seems to beat the heck out or rugs. Works great for me on both hardwoods and carpets. Ability to turn off beater with thumb controls is great!! Seems pretty durable.

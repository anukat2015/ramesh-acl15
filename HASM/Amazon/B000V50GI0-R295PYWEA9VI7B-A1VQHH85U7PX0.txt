Title: Works Well
Content:
I've had this Holmes heater for over 4 years. I rely on it during winter for heating my master bedroom, which measures about 13' x 15'.
About the offensive smell a lot of people are talking about - run it for a few hours in a well ventilated area. The smell the unit gives off should gradually diminish and eventually cease.
The heater has 2 heat settings. The heater heats my bed room just fine at the high setting. I don't have the manual anymore, but if my memory serves me, the lower setting is 750 W and the higher setting is 1500 W. The fan isn't very strong but it serves its intended purpose adequately nonetheless. On days when it's literally freezing outside, it takes the unit about an hour to warm the room up to a comfy temperature. It's slow and steady, but trusty.
The thermostat is somewhat fickle and doesn't always regulate the temperature the way you want it to. In my experience, that's to be expected from analog thermostats on portable units like this one. If it gets too warm, I simply turn it off.
The heater is fairly lightweight and very portable.

I'll once again be relying on this little guy this coming winter. In my book, the Holmes Ceramic heater is durable, well-constructed, and reliable.

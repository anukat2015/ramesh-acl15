Title: Don't like it yet.
Content:
I've been looking for a replacement vacuum for months.  Saw this one and thought it was just what I needed. It is quite similar to the one I replaced - an old Hoover windtunnel, but I truly wish I had my old one back.  I've only used the new vacuum once to try to clean laminate floors in 2 rooms; I haven't gotten to my berber carpet yet.  I'm too tired. I feel like I've been run over by a truck. This vacuum is awkward and exhausting to use so far. It was easy to put together, though. It took forever to get the telescoping handle to extend. The power brush attachment won't go under my sofa or coffee table.
I've had to vacuum both rooms twice. Now, being someone who HATES to vacuum, this did not make me happy. I don't like the wheels on the hard floor attachment and may pop them off (should I decide to keep it). Seems like they don't let the vacuum get close enough to the floor. The hose is hard and does get in the way. I assume it's made that way because it has electric wires inside. It DOES NOT pick up pet hair off my area rug, no matter which attachment or power level I used.  This is not good. With 4 dogs and a long haired cat in and out of the house, a vacuum that picks up pet hair is important for me. The slight electric shocks I get when I have the power brush plugged in really concern me. Maybe it's static shocks, but who knows. 
I'm going to move on down the hall to the bedroom carpets and see how it performs there.  If it's as bad on my carpet as it is on the laminate, I'm sending it back. For the amount we paid, the quality and performance should be better. I'm very disappointed in Hoover.  Guess I'll be going back to Sears. If you are considering this vacuum, I would keep on looking.

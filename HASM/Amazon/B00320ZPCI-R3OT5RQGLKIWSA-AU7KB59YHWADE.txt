Title: Great Desktop Replacement for those on the go.
Content:
My desktop crashed and my wife and I wanted to replace it with a laptop since we travel and use Skype with photo editing and video editing.  My wife also watches Hulu and wanted a fairly decent screen.  We were not disappointed.  Toshiba won us over and we will continue to buy their products.  Love the large RAM and hard drive.  Video quality is excellent and the addition of Blu-Ray made it all the better.  It had other qualities that HP and Sony did not offer at the time.  Toshiba was on of the first to go with Window's 7 on this large screen laptop.  I also needed a fast processor as I use Pinnacle Studios to create multi media projects.  This computer was up to the task.

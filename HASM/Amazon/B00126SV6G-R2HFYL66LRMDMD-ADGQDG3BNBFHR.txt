Title: Great Product!
Content:
I've had this for about 6 months and I like it now as much as I did the day I got it.  It's very easy to use - so intuitive you practically don't need to open the manual.  Aside from being user friendly it works and sounds great.
Audio Book Listeners - This is it !!  I promise you'll love it.  I have lots of audio books that I listen to and the ability to pause one book and pick-up another ... and then go back to the first and pick up where you left off is great.  Not to mention bookmarks.  I simply can't say enough about the Creative Zen when it comes to audio books.
But music sounds great also.  I listen to lots of different types of music while I run on the treadmill and it all sounds really good.
BTW - If you're looking for a good and Comfortable set of earphones I highly recommend the Brookstone Buds Retractable Surround-Sound Earbuds.  Very comfortable - You'll forget you're wearing them.  
I just bought a second pair yesterday for my wife.

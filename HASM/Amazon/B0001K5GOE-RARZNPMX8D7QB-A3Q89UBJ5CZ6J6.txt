Title: Bring on the G's!
Content:
We have not had this machine very long and can't speak to reliability, hence only four *s.  We have an 18th Century, four story farm house, four dogs, horses and stables outside.  No "deep pile" carpets, but various orientals, bare wood, some tile, even linoleum.  So far this machine has been awesome! The amount of dog hair, etc. dug out of carpets and sofas is amazing, even frightening.  After two weeks the house smells and feels cleaner than it ever has.  I am told that it is easy to carry up stairs and to store.  One small downside is that it apparently can be damaged by hard, sharp things like paperclips.  I tie fishing flies and it has picked up a very few hooks without complaint--but they were tiny.  Fine machine so far!

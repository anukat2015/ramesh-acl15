Title: Product with problems
Content:
I bought this product because it is inexpensive and compatible with the New York Public Library's audio books. The first Colby I bought would often freeze randomly (I would have to remove the AAA battery to restart it) and the player would occasionally make a loud electronic squeal and fast-forward. The company replaced it quickly. The second one I received has the same problems, though they occur less often. 
To be fair, I don't know much about technology; it's possible the problem is with the audio books themselves. However, I suspect this product has a lot of problems, because it came with a yellow flier in the box saying, "STOP. Need help? Call us! [...] CALL US BEFORE YOU CONSIDER RETURNING THE PRODUCT!"

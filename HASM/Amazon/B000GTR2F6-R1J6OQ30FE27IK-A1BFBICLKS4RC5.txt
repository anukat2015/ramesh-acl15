Title: Fantastic Addition to Our Kitchen
Content:
I am not a multiple coffee cup kind of guy. On occassion, however, I want just one good cup of coffee. When I saw the Keurig system I decided to give it a try and I am very glad I did. Gone are the old days of wasting coffee and time. The system works great and looks great too. Couldn't be happier. The comments about noise and problems with the coffee not being hot enough are jevenile. This system works as described and makes a great cup of coffee in under a minute. Worth every penny.

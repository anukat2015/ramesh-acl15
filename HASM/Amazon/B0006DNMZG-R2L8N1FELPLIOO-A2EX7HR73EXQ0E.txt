Title: Efficient Space Heater!
Content:
I moved to NY State from Houston, TX and this is my first winter here,  near Poughkeepsie. I couldn't do without my space heaters. I use the Honeywell mostly in the bedroom. It heats well and has an auto on/off function, so when the temp falls below whatever I set the knob for, it comes back on. The only downside is that the fan is a bit noisy, and there's no handle to grasp the heater with. You have to pick it up from near the bottom to move it. I'm satisfied with it. Good value for the money.

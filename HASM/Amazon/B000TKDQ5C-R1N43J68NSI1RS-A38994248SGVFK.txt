Title: Poor Quality - Knobs
Content:
I purchased this heater on sale for 19.99 with free shipping.  I didn't expect it to be the best for this price but assumed it would last for a while.  The last one I had was more expensive and bigger but the thermostat went out after a few years which is expected.  This particular one is made very flimsy.  The knobs are a thin plastic and cracked within the first day of turning it on/off a few times.  The fan is also in the back of the unit so you have to make sure where you put it so it will have circulation which can cause it to burn up quickly if not.  I definitely say a good price for the heat it produces but you MUST be very very careful turning the knobs or have a pair of pliers to do so when it cracks.  I am returning and spending a few more dollars for a heavier quality one.

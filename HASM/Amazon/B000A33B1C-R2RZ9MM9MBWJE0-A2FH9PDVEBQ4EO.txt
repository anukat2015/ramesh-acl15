Title: Very Pleased.
Content:
After reading the reviews posted for the Delonghi TRD0715T, I decided to order this heater. My home was built in 1911, it has 10 ft ceiling and large windows everywhere. I needed some extra heat in an upstairs bedroom. I run the unit on the lowest setting and after 30 minutes it supplies all the heat I need in a 12x18 bedroom. Very pleased with the unit. The packaging was not sufficient, but nothing was broken or dented.

Title: Bad Product
Content:
I was given this for my birthday.  Unfortunately I was out of town for a few weeks.  When I got around to getting it out of the box, it was like  amonth later so I couldnt send it back.  But it doesn't hold a charge.  I charge it, and a few hours later it is dead again.  It's got nifty features, but I can't use it because its always dead.  I'm going to get an MP3 player that takes a battery.

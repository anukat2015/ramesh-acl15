Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens 
 Ordered this June 4th and recieved it on June 5th, great service. Due to the information provided on web site and service Amazon provides is why I keep buying my items from Amazon. Thanks Amazon. This I am sure is more camera than I need. I like gagets and gizmos so I decided to spend the extra dollars this time on camera. I am learning more each day but so much to learn since I have only had point and shoot experience in the past. Thinking about taking a photography class too, should be helpful to improve my skills. Also thinking about the purchase of a larger telephoto lens.
I just retired so photography will be my full time enjoyment.

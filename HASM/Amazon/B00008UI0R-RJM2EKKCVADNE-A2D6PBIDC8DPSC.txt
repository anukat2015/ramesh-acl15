Title: Great Vacuum for the Price!
Content:
We scoured the internet for information about the vacuum cleaners out there and decided on this Hoover after reading many reviews.  We have not been disappointed.  It is very light and easy to maneuver and has plenty of power.  It's very user-friendly and easy to operate.  My grandmother liked it so much that she had me order her one and has told me how nice it is compared to the big, heavy vacuum she has had for years.  I like the ease of emptying the canister once it is full and the idea that I don't have to buy bags for it.  We have been very happy with our purchase!  I'm sure that there are better vacuum cleaners out there if you want to pay more money, but for the price, I give this one five stars.

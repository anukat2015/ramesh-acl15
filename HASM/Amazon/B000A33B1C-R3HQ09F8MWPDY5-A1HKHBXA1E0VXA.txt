Title: Excellent product, saves us a lot of money
Content:
I bought two of these exactly a year ago, and now that the cold weather is back, I'm thinking about getting a third!  We moved from CA to NC last winter and were not prepared for the drop in winter temperature at all!  The new home we live in is around 2500 sq ft - which means there are lots of rooms we don't use but pay to heat using the gas furnace - all night.  Our first month in the home last year our gas bill was $400!  I almost threw up when I saw it.  So we quickly ordered two of these Delonghi Dragon heaters with the timer and put one in each of my kids' bedrooms.  We set it to turn on around an hour before bedtime and turn off in the morning when they wake up, at 900 watts (the middle setting).
Their bedrooms are kept nice and warm all night - no noise, no smell, no dry air.  We lowered the heat in the house at night to around 65 degrees and our gas bill dropped by $200 the following month and has been pretty consistent through the winter months.  The electric bill, on the other hand, has moved up a little, but my guess is these contribute &lt;$10 a month to that bill.  Still a huge cost savings, and works like a charm!

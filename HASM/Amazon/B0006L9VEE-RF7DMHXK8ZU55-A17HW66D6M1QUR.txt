Title: DeLonghi Hits Another Home Run!
Content:
The DeLonghi DCM900 is both stylish and functional. As a bonafide 'coffee geek', I have used numerous machines. After 3 other espresso makers, I stopped at the DeLonghi...and now, with this coffee maker, the quest for a great cup of daily brew may have come to an end.
The 'shower head' provides an even flowing rush of water onto the grounds to give you a quick, full-flavored brew every time.
I still have a fantastic Cuisinart with several bells and whistles, but my wife drinks decaf while I prefer regular. I roast my own beans, and can definitely taste a difference between this pot and an off-the-shelf model from the local discount store.

Title: Excellent
Content:
I live in central Arizona and I have 700 square foot shop with nine foot walls and an open ceiling.  This heater is just right for the job.  It's easy to light and on the coldest mornings - which aren't all that cold, maybe 20 degrees at worst - has the place comfortable in a half hour or less.  Then I turn it down and turn the ceiling fan on low to push the heat down.  I don't know how I would improve on it, small and simple.

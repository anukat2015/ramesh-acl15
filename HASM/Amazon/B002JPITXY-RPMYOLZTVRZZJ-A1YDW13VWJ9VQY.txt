Title: great but could be better
Content:
i purchased this to listen to music an maybe watch ripped dvd's. if you want to do that look no further. the Zune is stylish and shockingly light. the sound quality is excellent and videos are a joy to watch. i previously had a ipod touch and found it to be a pain, especially in the itunes department. the Zune software is wondrous and I've discovered new types of music as well as new artists. wireless sync allows you collection to be updated while you sleep or are away and is especially handy if your adding large amounts of file to you library and don't have to time to watch the transfer. on the downside i think that there really needs to be a few more basic apps such as, messenger, a mail client, solitaire, and so on. all in all a great buy.

Title: great camera, buy only from amazon
Content:
I love my new digital rebel XT. Takes great pictures especially with the EF 50mm f1.8 lens I got for it.
The kit lens is fine for an amateur like me.
BUT, I would hesitate to order from any of the other merchants listed here, except for Amazon. 
I got my camera from Adorama, and they sent me a torn up reciept in the box. I needed the reciept for my rebate and they would NOT return my emails requesting a new copy of me receipt.
From now on, I only order directly through Amazon.

Title: Best Coffee I ever made!
Content:
I have been using a Bunn pourover type machine for years but I got tired of replacing them every few years becuase of a leaking reservoir.  I am so glad I found this one!
Pros:  Timer, very large carafe that keeps coffee very hot for hours, small footprint, stylish machine (especially compared to the ugly old Bunn), pause and serve, charcoal filter to filter out chlorine taste and smell is a definate plus!  Oh yeah and EXCELLENT COFFEE!!!!
Cons:  The thermal carafe does not pour very easily....I think the lid is designed to keep heat in and as an unfortunate side effect, keeps coffee in as well.  Takes #4 Cone filters and I have a huge stock of standard basket filters (although I wonder if this is why the coffee is so good?)  The price @ 99.99 is a con as well; I bought mine for $51.02 from Amazon - not sure why they want so much for it now.  Reconditioned item has 90 warranty instead of 3 yrs.
I have bought 2 other reconditioned appliances from amazon before and have always been happy with them...so don't let that scare you.  However for 99.99 you can buy a brand new similar model and have the full 3 yr warranty.  Hopefully the price will come back down.

Title: sweet little ipod!
Content:
I just love my ipod nano, it's the cutest little mp3 player..  I thought that i had a problem with it, but i guess the battery was just really dead..  Doesn't matter because the problem was solved..  I would have to say that this is ipod was money well spent..  I am actually thinking about buying one for my husband..
thanks,
AJ

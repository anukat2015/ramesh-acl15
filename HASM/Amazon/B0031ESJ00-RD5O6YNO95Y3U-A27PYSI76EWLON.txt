Title: OK for the most part
Content:
I like:
powerful enough for most applications.
big screen, great colors and nice play back of blue-ray and dvd's.
excellent packaging.
nice and sleek style. 
What I don't like;
some keyboard keys does not respond unless you hit them momre than once. the "delete" key is killing me. 
no external volume control. 
built-in cam has not so good pic quality. you may need your own if you like good pic. 
no windows cd and no system no backup cd's. not sure what to do if I need to stage the machine.

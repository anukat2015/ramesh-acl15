Title: Shark Roadster Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I started out loving this vacuum, loving the powerful suction, however, like most of these reviews, the problem with overheating is a bit much.  Where it should take 45 minutes to vacuum, it takes almost three hours because you have to let it cool off.  And yes, I have cleaned the filters, all three of them and it works one time and the next time it shuts off after approximately 15 minutes of use. Save your money and buy something else.

Title: EOS 5d MK II
Content:
I received my 5D MK II about 3 weeks ago.  I have already shot over 2,000 shots and I can't believe the pictures.  Most of my work is youth hockey.  Shooting in Manual mode with ISO set at 6,400, I am able to shoot at 1/500th or better at f 3.5.  My standard lens is the 70-200mm f2.8L and naturally I never use flash.
The details are incredible, noise not a factor, and it focuses pretty fast.  My previous camera was the 30D, and there is just no comparison.  I have had no problems with battery life either.
For the money ($2,699) truly a great camera.  I can't wait to do my next wedding.

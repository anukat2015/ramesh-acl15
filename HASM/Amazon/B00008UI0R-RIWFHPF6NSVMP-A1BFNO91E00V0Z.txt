Title: Problems
Content:
Update:
We've now owned this machine for 3 months.  I would definitely rate it lower now.  Belt wear is a real problem causing the belt to slip off requiring taking the power nozzle apart to fix/replace the belt.  When purchasing replacement belts, I was told that this is a very frequent problem with many customers complaining.  The plastic construction suggests to me that frequent belt replacement will cause the screws to begin to fail in the near future.  This is a real problem!
Original note:
We've had this vacuum for about a month now and certainly it lives up to its billing as being easy to use and powerful.  That said, we moved to this from a very aging (probably 30 years old) electrolux with power nozzle.  We had read all the wonderful accolades about bag-less vacuums and were so happy when our son gave us this as a Christmas present.
What I don't like about this, and perhaps all bag-less units, is the need to wash and clean the filter and dirt collection bowl so frequently.  I have found that this is needed after about every 3 uses.  We have a golden retriever which means there is a fair amount of hair collected whenever it runs and so I am sure that this contributes to the problem; but surely it cannot be the only reason.
This technology is sold as being cleaner to use; but I can assure you I stayed a lot cleaner replacing paper bags in the electrolux.

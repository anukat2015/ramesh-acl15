Title: It was good while it worked
Content:
I purchased this Delonghi EW7707CM heater about a month ago, but didn't need to use it until this past week.  At first, it was great and heated up my 12x14 bedroom quite effectively.  That is, it heated well until one of the two switches refused to activate after being switched on, leaving me with only the "low" setting working.  I will not attempt to return the unit for service or replacement because the return postage is too expensive.  I'll put it out in next spring's subdivision garage sale and hopefully get a few bucks back.  I'm going to buy a replacement space heater at Home Depot so at least it will be easier to return if it flakes out.

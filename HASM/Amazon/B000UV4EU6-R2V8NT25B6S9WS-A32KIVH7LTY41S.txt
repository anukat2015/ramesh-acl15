Title: had 2 of them, both glitched
Content:
I have had 2 of these and both are full of glitches, the first one just went crazy and started doing its own thing then suddenly went dead. I tried everything, hit the reset button "NADA" thought maybe somehow the battery went dead..."NOPE" again NADA...Nothing! 
So I sent it back and got another one...this one I am sending back today because it shuts off in the middle of songs, also the screen goes white when you return from the locked position. They are GREAT when they work however, I really love the size and the crystal clear LCD screen...Love the whole idea of what they are but they got some serious bugs to work out. I think I will go back to Sansa cause at least my old 1 GB Sansa still works fine, it's just not enough memory...so off to shopping I go.

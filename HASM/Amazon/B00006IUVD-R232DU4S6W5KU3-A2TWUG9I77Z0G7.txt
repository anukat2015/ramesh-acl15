Title: A Good Coffee Maker
Content:
I've only had this product for about 3 weeks, so I can't vouch for it's long term viability, but so far it's very good. Easy to use, easy to clean, and makes very good coffee quickly. The mug is unbreakable (one of my cats tested that), insulated, and fits well in my car drink holder. Well worth the price.

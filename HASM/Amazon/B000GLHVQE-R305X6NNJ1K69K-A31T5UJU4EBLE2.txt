Title: Very neat little heater. Power for the size!
Content:
I'm hoping this works a long time but so far so good! I've had it for abotu a month and it's in my dining roon which also includes my kitchen and it's really heating things up for its size. It's very nice having this little fire by the table at night. So nice in fact I put it on all the time even when no heat is required. Love the coal, better than fake logs. It looks more real. The only thing I am sad about is I was incapable of finding a corner one in this size... so I just angled this one and it works... not as good as a real corner one but oh well...
Where I have it I don't mind that it doesn't have a remote but I can see how that would become an issue eventually.
You wont regret your money. Good quality/price ratio.

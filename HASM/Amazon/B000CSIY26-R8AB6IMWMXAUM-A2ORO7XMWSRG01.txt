Title: Installation
Content:
The unit works fine and there was no dripping on the floor. However, installation was close to impossible.  The contraption to be used to vent through the window has a hole placed in such a way that when you make the sliding panel fit the window, the hole does not line up.  I had to use all kinds of jerryrigged ideas to get it to vent.  The panel has a sliding insert, when you line up the holes in each, it will no longer fit in the window.  The unit it replaced fit perfectly.  Another annoying thing is that when you turn the unit on, it automatically goes to whatever it was on before.  So if it was on a/c and you turn it on, you have to push the buttons to cycle from a/c through dehumidifier to fan.  The lowest setting of the fan is higher than I would expect and appears to be identical to medium.  The unit that was replaced had a nice low speed that was quiet.  This does not. It is quite loud.

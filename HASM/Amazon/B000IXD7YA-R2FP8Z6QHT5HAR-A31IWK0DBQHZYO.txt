Title: P105 S6114
Content:
The build quality is top notch. It feels as good as it looks. There is no flex at all, anywhere. I believe that this laptop will last a very long time. Everything seems to fit exactly where it's supposed to, no clicks or clacks whatsoever. Excellent ratio price-to-performance.
Pros:
Great quality build 
Excellent 17" screen 
Quality HDD with plenty of space 
Core 2 Duo processor 
Not bad battery life (considering the power and size of the notebook)
Cons:
Keyboard takes some getting used to 
HDD could have been 5400rpm 
Ram should have been 667 MHz.

Title: The Best Ipod To Date
Content:
First of all i would like to mention this could go for some more space 16gb isnt that much. Many people hace complained about the price but this a revulutionary pruduct. It has a touch screen interface that I find so easy to use. I had a 30 gb ipod video. I thought it was ok but it only got 3 hours of playback and i had to charge it everyday but know it has much more music and video playing time even with a big screen if ur just listening to music make sure ur wi-fi is turned off i found thta it wastes a lot of battery. I LOVE MY IPOD

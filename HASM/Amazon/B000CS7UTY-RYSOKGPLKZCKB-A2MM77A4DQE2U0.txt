Title: Great Alternative to those others....
Content:
Music is such a huge part of our lives.  No wonder Ipod has such a large sales base and following.  But I am not a follower...I was looking for an alternative to the Ipods and the Zunes.  My son had a Creative player for several years before it died tragically in a glass of water on his desk (don't ask).  When it came time to replace it, he only wanted another one.  Then my husband wanted one.  Then I bought one. And this Christmas, my oldest is getting one for a present.  We all have the same one- and all like it tremendously.  It takes a bit of time to get used to all the features and to even find them.  But once you are up and running you will enjoy hours and hours of music, videos, pictures....  You won't go wrong buying this one.  Even if it isn't one of the more well known.

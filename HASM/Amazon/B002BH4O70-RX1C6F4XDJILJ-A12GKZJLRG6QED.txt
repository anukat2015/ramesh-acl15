Title: More than a netbook
Content:
This device is a better option for those who are thinking to buy a netbook 
as I wanted. There are some reasons I didn't bought a netbook:
- Almost all have 160 GB HD
- It has only 1gb ram, instead some that have 2gb
- Some have reduced keyboard
- They don't have dedicated video card
This HP-Dv2 has more good things like:
- It's also thin as netbooks
- It's only 2 inches bigger than netbooks
- It comes with an exteral usb dvd drive
- Good processor similar to the intel atom in netbooks
- More space 250GB HD
- Dedicated video card
- 2GB ram
- The price doesnt have a big difference comparing with netbooks cause 
  the aditional things and performance are compensated in the aditional
  money. The external DVD drive is original HP, if it would be sold it 
  could cost like U$100.
Well those who are thinking in buying a netbook I recomend to you this DV2
the model is very nice and interesting.

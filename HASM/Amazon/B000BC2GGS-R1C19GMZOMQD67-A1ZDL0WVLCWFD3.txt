Title: Great heater
Content:
This heater is very effective at heating the room.  It is silent even when it switches the power on and off.  The controls are easy to use.  Being able to set the temperature and then go away for hours is just great.  We leave it on a lower setting all night while we sleep nearby.
This heater is probably most effective if you also have another heater, like a heat dish, that reflects heat to anyone sitting in front of it.
Great heater!  So much so that we're buying another.

Title: A Frappe Maker That Mostly Works
Content:
I'm old enough to remember those Dimaggio ads for a cheap coffee maker. For the most part it brewed bad coffee. Now Mr. Coffee is selling a Frappe Maker. Frankly, it works well and makes frappes that will surely please your friends. However, a few caveats. First, the lid is made from black plastic and the symbols are the same color which is fine in of it self. However, it's easy to not get a tight seal, and this leads to a messy experience. Be that as it may it works much better than any home frappe maker that I've used, and is much better than even an expensive blender. I'm not sure why but the cutter that blends the frappe appears to work much better than a blender.

Title: Loved it until it broke
Content:
I loved this little heater (used it in my office)- it heated well and the settings were convenient.  5 months after I bought it, the high fan setting stopped rotating and the low fan setting blew out cold air.  I could use it as a cooling fan instead of a heater.  Very disappointing since it had great features and heated well when it worked.
I saw info in the manual that said I could send it back for repair under warranty, so I paid to ship it and sent a check for $7 to pay for return shipping.  Weeks later, I still never got it back.  I emailed Holmes and they said they no longer repair broken heaters but they would send me a new one.  
I got the new one, and the temperature settings didn't work from the get-go.  It just blows hot air.  It makes a noise too.  I decided not to bother requesting yet another one, so I am waiting for it to break completely so I can buy another brand.  
Oh, someone at work bought the same one, one month after I bought my original heater.  It broke on her 5 months later!

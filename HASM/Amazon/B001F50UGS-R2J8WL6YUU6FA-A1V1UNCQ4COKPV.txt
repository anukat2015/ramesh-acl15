Title: Its ok
Content:
It's really cute and its a Sony. My son has one and it even survived being mashine washed, so I know it will be around for a while. Sound is great, very clear. Battery life is awesome. Easy of transfering music leaves A LOT to be desired. I download songs through I Tunes, I have to save them onto a CD and then save the music from the CD on my computer before I can transfer them onto the MP3. The device says its compatible Jukebox but I had no luck. It's a real pain. Just thinking about the process makes me weary of downloading more music!

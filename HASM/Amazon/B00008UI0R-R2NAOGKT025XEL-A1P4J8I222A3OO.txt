Title: Meets Expectations
Content:
I have an injury to my dominant arm, the one I would use to operate a vacuum cleaner.  The other arm just can't do it, for some odd reason.  This vacuum does a good job and operates in a straight-forward manner.  It does not take much in the way of personal power to operate.  I particularly like the bagless system, even though there are those who say it is not the best choice for households with pets.  It does take up a bit more storage space than my useless old upright.

Title: Awesome product
Content:
I just purchased this product at BB yesterday, and I couldn't be happier! This was one case where BB had a better price than Amazon, $599.99.  This is an exceptionally good laptop for that kind of dough, it does everything I need it to and then some. I have to give kudos to Intel for this amazing processor, it is way faster than my core 2 duo, with a lot of the same specs. The screen, however, is my favorite part, really crisp and clear for every purpose. I am not a gamer though, so that may not be it's best purpose. For a general household computer, it is more than sufficient with internet needs, email, music storage and streaming, and for movies as well, although a blu-ray disc player would be a nice addition.  Not that I can complain for the price!! This gets 2 very big thumbs up!

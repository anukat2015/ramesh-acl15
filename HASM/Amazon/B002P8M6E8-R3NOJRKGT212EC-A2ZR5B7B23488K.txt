Title: Excellent Computer, Excellent Price
Content:
I purchased this computer as a portable alternative to my 20-inch iMac.  I was very close to purchasing the new 13-inch MacBook when I decided to take a quick look at the Windows alternatives.  Although I had some moral issues about "switching to the dark side", this computer has certainly alleviated the majority of my concerns.  After removing some of the added bloatware, I began using the computer, and felt pretty much at home.  Ergonomically, the computer feels like a Mac.  The design is very sleek, and it is clear that the placing of every key and  button was carefully thought out.  In terms of processing power, the 2.2 Ghz of memory, combined with 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB Hard Drive, makes a fast and very capable machine.  The computer also has incredible speakers for a laptop.  Although it may not be true surround sound, as the box and stickers on the computer claim, it is as good if not better than the speakers on a MacBook.  Overall this is a great computer at a price that is more than 46% less than the cost of a MacBook.  Other bonuses include an HDMI port, HD-level graphics, and a Super-Multi Drive (all formats, including Blu-Ray).  This is the perfect computer for anybody looking for a powerful computer at a reasonable price.

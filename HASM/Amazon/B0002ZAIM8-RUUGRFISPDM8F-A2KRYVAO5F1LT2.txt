Title: My second iPod shuffle.
Content:
Wll, they are small, so I misplaced my first one (I 512k).  Found it later.  But I figure that it will wear out anyway (even if switches go on forever, batteries WILL eventually die) given the heavy use I put it to.  I really like the fact that it does no need an external cord like the newer ones, which is why I bought it even though it was the same price as the newer one.  I also use it mostly in the car, since I do not tend to like headphones.
Also, the iTunes has gotten better as a program, but I have not bought anything better from the service.  I had a CD collection before I got the iPod, and feeding in my older CDs has gotten me to reacquaint myself with a good many CDs.   Now, about that vinyl...

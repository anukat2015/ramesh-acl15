Title: A masterpiece, but unfortunately not all good ...
Content:
Negative:
-the light on the screen is 'bleeding' through on the bottom. The colors are then lighter towards the bottom then on the top.
- the sound is awful. That cheap laptop I had before had loudspeakers on the top of the lid and then on the bottom part too. The Sony just has those awful sounding (first I thought I have to remove a cover somewhere for better quality but no, that's it). The laptop is more one for work or office use (exactly what i use it for) and less for multimedia. Doesnt sony call the laptop a  business solution?
- the power adopter was defective when i got it. I dont understand that, dont they test at all at Sony? How can they deliver a defective power adopter? Sony send me a new adopter in just two days. Maybe they only test every other unit?
- The software CD or DVD is missing. Well, i formatted and installed my own stuff anyway so it doesnt bother me much.
- The connector on the laptop where the power supply goes really sucks. Why dont they have that magnet solution like those from Apple? (or something similar?) I bet that this will be the first to break for me. 
- the webcam is not that great. The picture quality is so blurred, the colors are to colorful and just not good.
overall, i wish they would have spend a little more money on the camera, the sound and the power connector to the laptop. That would have been like another 30$ and would result in something really great.
   
Postive
- it really is a master piece. So beautiful (after removing all those stickers). The product is high quality.
- Sony is very responsive. They even wanted to pick up the laptop for repair but i found out already that the power adopter that came with laptop was defective.
- the screen is just great!!! very bright, nice colors and big too. I wish there would be even one thats bigger.
- I like the keyboard. I think there will be not much stuff falling into the cracks.
- I like the mechanism of how the laptop closes. I hope the plastic will not crack and break all over like all the other laptops always do. 
The laptop is heavy. But what would you expect? It is a big laptop and you will trade off size and power for weight. There are no miracles like that.

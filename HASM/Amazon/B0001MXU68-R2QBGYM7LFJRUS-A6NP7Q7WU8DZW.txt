Title: Melitta One, Mango
Content:
A very interesting coffeemaker indeed. Funky but conservative colors and a rocket-shaped design lets you know this product is unique. It is not small, however, just because it's a single serve maker does not make it small. It serves about 4-5 cups with one coffeepod and is instantly warmed up and ready to go. The only drawback is buying the pods specifically made for coffeemakers such as these and they can't be used for any other coffee maker.

Title: Not enough Heat for a big room
Content:
I have a large bonus room with several large windows. Not very insulated. My old kerosene heater went out and I bought this Soleus Air MS-09 heater. Even though I could see the benefits of this radiant heater in a fairly closed space, I just couldn't get warm. I returned it and purchased a replacement kerosene heater which heats up the bonus room quite nicely. 
As far as the Soleus Air MS-09, I like the energy efficiency of it, but if's it real cold (less than 50 degrees) and you're not in close line of sight of the beam, it doesn't heat very well.

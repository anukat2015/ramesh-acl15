Title: Back to Pentax .... after many yaers.... :-)
Content:
Well for a long time I've been one from the domain of MF 645 and saved many good words for Pentax quality. Well this camera isn't disappointment.I've been using this camera for two weeks and can say it is cool! The image quality is very good, camera is easy to use, light, handy and steady. The overall impression is very positive. The Pentax optics is  cool! I have tried it also with Sigma's 24-70 2.8 zoom that is amazingly and surprisingly quality stuff.

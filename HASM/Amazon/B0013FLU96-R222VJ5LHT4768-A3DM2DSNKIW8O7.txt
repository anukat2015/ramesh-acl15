Title: MacBook Pro - beautiful computer in every way
Content:
I have owned one of these computers for two years now. As a student that is working and stressing for an average of 17 hours a day, this computer is amazing. 
It's entirely dependable, and even after two years, it doesnt feel like it has slowed down at all. The computer looks great, performs great, and the constant updates and enthusiastic fan community really make sure that every aspect of the computer is great.
Before purchasing this computer, I had two main concerns, cost and compatibility.
Compatibility - As an intensive user of Microsoft Office, I was concerned with the fact that the Mac version seems very crippled. Turns out that with the proper software (I like VMWARE), you can install a Windows system and run the windows version of Office. It's a great solution, and the computer will not slow down much. As for all the other Mac programs, I love all of them. When I first started using my Mac, I couldnt get over how integrated everything is; it really feels like it's YOUR computer.
Cost - at $1200 (the price this laptop is listed at), it's a bargain. If the laptop cost any more, I'd definitely still consider a PC because there are some pretty inexpensive computing alternates.

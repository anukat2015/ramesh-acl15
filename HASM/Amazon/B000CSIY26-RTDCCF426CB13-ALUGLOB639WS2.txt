Title: Loud, but works
Content:
Okay I haven't had any of the drainage issues, but I live in Southern Cali and the humidity isn't too bad. It was easy to install, if you live in an apartment before you begin also pick up some HVAC duct tape and some weather stripping. Because I have the glass slide windows I wanted to make sure I was keeping the cold air in. We use the AC in our bedroom only approx. 300 sq. ft and it easily drops down to 71- 73 F. The only drawback is the noise, but it eventually fades to white noise and you can sleep with it. Personally for summer comfort while sleeping this unit does a good job.

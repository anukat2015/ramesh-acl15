Title: LOVE this vacuum!!!
Content:
I reviewed vacuums for months before settling on the Bosch Compact.  I have absolutely no regrets!!  After owning a few uprights, which were heavy and after a while, spit out more dust than they took in, I am pleased to say that the Bosch is very light, which makes it really easy to vacuum stairs and it picks up even the slightest dust.  The retractable, long cord is a great feature and having only one attachment, makes life much simpler when having to switch to it, in order to get into tight corners, or vacuum furniture.  I LOVE my vacuum!!!

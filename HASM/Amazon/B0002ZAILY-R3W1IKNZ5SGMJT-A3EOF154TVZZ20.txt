Title: clogged after short time has phantom songs on it !
Content:
I DID love my Shuffle. But now it has exhibited a VERY strange trait that has made it almost unusable. The thing reads as if it has 512 mbs of music on it, when in fact, it has only 150 mb of music on it. 
Other than that its good but this is probably my 7th MP3 player and this has NEVER happened before. 
This is really poor; I have only had it for a few months. 
I am very disappointed.

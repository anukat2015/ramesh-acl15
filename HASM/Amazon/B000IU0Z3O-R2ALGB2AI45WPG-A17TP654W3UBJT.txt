Title: This vacuum will save my back!
Content:
This vacuum is just what I wanted.  I have had an upright vacuum in an apartment with all hardwood floors for a while now.  Not a good thing!  When I use the hose (plus attachment) from the upright to vacuum the floor, the hose isn't long enough so I have to stoop and end up hurting my back every time.  Plus, the upright is heavy and is always tipping over during this process.  Very frustrating.  This cute little canister vacuum will completely save my back.  I just got it yesterday and tried it out last night.  It has a long hose, so no stooping.  The floor attachment angles, so it's easy to get under furniture and feel like you're actually picking up the dirt.  It has great suction!  Plus, it's so light weight, it's a breeze to maneuver.  I was done vacuuming in such a short time!  I really couldn't believe it.  I'm very much looking forward to using this regularly.  I love this vacuum!

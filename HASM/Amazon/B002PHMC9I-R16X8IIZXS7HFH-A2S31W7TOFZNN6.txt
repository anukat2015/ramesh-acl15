Title: Great deal but I believe I got a used/refurbished piece..!! :-(
Content:
I paid full price for this HP DV4 1540US laptop on November 5th 2009. I received the delivery of the computer promptly on Monday November 9th 2009. But when I opened the box it felt like I got a used/refurbished computer
Computer was loosely placed in the box without any cover. The power cord was open and placed loosely on the top of the computer....The user manual was open and placed on the computer instead of its designated location...I was very disappointed with the quality of packaging...It felt like the computer was opened used and then sent to me...It was very disappointing to get this kind of service quality from Amazon...
...I was so excited when I ordered the new computer after almost 5 years...(My Dell Dimension 5100 desktop died on me week before!! so decided to get a new computer)..but this made me rethink/doubt about Amazon's commitment to customer satisfaction and quality.
Please keep this in mind before ordering electronics from Amazon.com.

Title: Great Value
Content:
Just unpacked it last night. Looks great on the counter, and I absolutely love the front access. It came with the permanent gold basket filter which was a plus compared to other models that sold it separately. All the functions were easy enough to figure out without reading the manual. The aroma function dose add time to brewing, but it's a great option when time allows. I was also amazed that the pour while brewing feature allows you to just pull the pot out mid brew, without dripping a single drop on the burner. Another plus was the pot dose not drip or spill while pouring, really a well designed carafe. The coffee produced was hot not scolding but acceptable temperature. The cup warmer was another nice option though it doesn't heat the cup it does take the chill out of it which otherwise would have cooled the coffee. The recommended scoop to water ratio seems way too strong, and I like a bold flavor. So other than that I would say for under 60 bucks we got a great deal, provided it last us a couple of years. I would highly recommend this to anyone shopping for a drip maker in the under a hundred dollar range.

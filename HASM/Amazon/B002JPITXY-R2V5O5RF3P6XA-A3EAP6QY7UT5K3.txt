Title: Love it
Content:
I love this device. It's very easy to use, it has the built in HD radio, and you can cram a ton of music on it. If you have a small collection, you can fill it up with ease with a zune pass. The only thing I am sad about is it no longer has the ability to share music with another zune user with the search nearby wireless function like the old one...and if you can I can't seem to find that feature. One of the best MP3 players on the market hands down.

Title: Love this A/C.
Content:
I am so far extremely pleased with this air conditioner. It's very well designed and as an engineer, albeit industrial engineer, it's well built and is impressive in it's cooling ability. Very nice styling overall but surprisinly heavy given the size. I would give this top marks in all categories.

Title: Overheating Concern - Fire Hazzard?
Content:
My wife and I bought this several years ago and really liked it at first. However, recently we had a VERY serious concern. This has been one of the coldest weeks in recent history and this little heater has been put to work. Usually we just leave it on auto and it handily turns itself on and off when needed to heat up our cold dining room. But apparently it has been overworking this week...
Today my wife pulled the DVTH's plug out to plug something else in the same outlet and noticed that part of the outlet cover was discolored. She then noticed the end of the heater's plug was extremely hot. It appears that part of the plastic on both the plug and outlet cover has been melted... 'sigh of relief' I think that could have started a fire had my wife not unplugged it today.
On the product's website it says it has an "Automatic Safety Shutoff." Not so sure about that... It should also be noted that a previous version of this model, the DVH, was recalled in 2004. The Problem then: "A faulty electrical connection can cause the heater to overheat and stop working, posing a fire hazard to consumers."
Sound familiar?

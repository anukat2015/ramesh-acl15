Title: Macbook graduates to PRO status!
Content:
Well I must say I am very happy i did not buy apple's first iteration of the 13" aluminum macbook last year b/c they really got it right the second time around upgrading it to a macbook pro!  Its nice to have that "pro" stamp on a 13" now!  Apple has listened to their customers adding almost everything we have asked for and more, and managed to reduce the price!  Thanks Apple!
CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR
- $100 less
- 13" aluminum macbooks became macbook pros
- 2.53Ghz up from 2.4GHz dual core
- 4GB RAM up from 2GB
- led display has 60% greater color gamut than previous model
- new advanced built-in battery that lasts up to 7 hours vs 4hrs
- FireWire is back (after all the complaints of first model)
- SD card slot (replaces express card slot)
- new models now come with iLife '09
- separate digital audio input is gone
- new model uses the same integrated mic and headphone port as the iPhone
PROS
-  finally a price cut with a performance upgrade!  i knew apple could do it.  i was tired of paying for aesthetics and not performance.
-  new Snow Leopard Operating System comes pre-installed! Same great ease of use with much faster performance!
-  much better lcd screen! inline with the pro models...still glossy and still some glare but much nicer!
-  backlight keyboard on all 13" models now! ( i really enjoy this as it can be controlled from low to high)
-  battery life is significantly better than last year.( i get about 6 hours w/ regular use not the 7hrs that is reported)
-  the computer is designed beautifully truly a head turner.
-  iLife 09 suite is superb for pictures, movies, and music.  Good software really does sell hardware.
-  SD card slot accepts SDHC, which goes up to 32GB and works like a charm.  (can boot from SD card as well)
CONS
- aluminum outer casing does dent easily if dropped. (buy a soft case for it!)
- power cord is short and does not reach as many places as I would like...must sit very close to power outlet.
- battery can't be removed easily
- SD card sticks about half way out of slot. eye sore.
- blu-ray option would have been nice but understandable given licensing fees. (many blurays are offering digital copies which help)
Taking into consideration all the great improvements over last year with a nice price cut I can now truly recommend this near perfect Macbook Pro!

Title: Not Built to Last
Content:
I've put up with this vacuum for almost 3 years now and since it's still being sold, here's what buyers can expect over time. 
It seems to pick up dirt well enough, but the Fantom Lightning I had before this did better. I judge this by how much grit comes up when I steam clean the rugs after vacuuming.
The light bulb died at 6 months. Also at 6 months, the front wheel stopped swiveling, making it more difficult to maneuver the canister. At 8 months the switch module behaved erratically, shutting off the power nozzle. The switch is handy but badly placed and easily turned off when changing hand positions on the handle.
The telescoping wand is a wonderful feature, but started sticking after the first year. Now it doesn't work at all. Finally, the plastic connector broke at the base of the wand so the power nozzle is now permanently attached to the wand. The two hand tools can only be used with the short end of the hose, requiring a lot of bending to reach the floor. I could replace the part, but I want a new vacuum because all of my baseboards, bathroom vanities, even the refrigerator have permanent black lines two inches off the floor. I'll never buy another Hoover product.

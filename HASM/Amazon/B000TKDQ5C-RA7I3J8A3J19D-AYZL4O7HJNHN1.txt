Title: Decent Heat for the Price
Content:
For the price, you really can't beat this heater.  It had two fan settings (low/high) and a thermostat for additional control of the heat coming out.  You're not going to be able to heat a decent sized room with it, although it will do a fine job keeping your feet warm.  Just don't expect much more than that.
The first time I tried to turn the fan speed knob, it broke off in my hand.  The replacement has held up much better, although I find myself being pretty careful when I turn it.  I just remind myself it was $20 and treat it accordingly.
For the money, this heater really can't be beat.

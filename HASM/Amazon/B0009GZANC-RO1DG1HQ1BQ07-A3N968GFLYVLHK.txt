Title: great DSLR  for beginner
Content:
The feel, operation and results are excellent.  My first DSLR. I was also considering Canon Rebel XTi but after trying both cameras at store to compare the handle feeling. D50 is the one with a better handle.  Great camera and great price I paid on Amazon.

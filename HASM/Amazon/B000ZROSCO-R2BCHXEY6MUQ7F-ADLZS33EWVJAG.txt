Title: Great idea, but not quite there.
Content:
I ordered this product for our upstairs bedroom vent to help cool the room. The thermostat to control the fan speed is a great idea, but ours doesn't consistently run only when the AC kicks on. When it does run, it's not exactly quiet and kind of annoying. However, we do manage to sleep through it fine. Overall though, I gave this product only 2 stars because it doesn't force that much more cold air into the room. It would also be helpful if the vent slats were directional. Running the fan function by itself (not with the AC) produces no extra cold air, only air movement. 
After purchasing one, I hoped it would work at least okay to purchase another for my upstairs office. Instead, I'm shelling out the money for a free standing AC unit. I'd advise you to do the same if you want cold air.

Title: Does what I want it to do
Content:
I bought this to raise the temperature in a fairly large room by 3 or so degrees when it's very cold outside. It does accomplish that within a reasonable amount of time. It also makes it more comfortable to sit on the nearby couch. This generally prevents my girlfriend from turning up the main thermostat when she gets to chilled - a practice that results in a significantly higher heating bill. After all, it's silly to heat an entire house when we're just sitting on the couch.

Title: Cheaply made, terrible customer service.
Content:
Only buy this computer if you love having broken equipment that takes months to repair.  I began using this in November 2009.  By the end of December 2009, the left mouse button was stuck down and broken.  I foolishly assumed that my computer would be quickly repaired if I shipped it off to Toshiba.  Very wrong about that, I was told it was "estimated" to be 2 months before the new part would arrive.  And they would need to keep my computer the entire time until the new part arrived in order for it to be repaired.  WHAT???  After dealing with that annoying problem and getting my repaired computer back, the mouse button broke again after 2 months of use.  I haven't attempted to have it repaired yet.  It will probably take me a few weeks to work up the courage to deal with their customer service again.  
I also agree with others that the speakers are worthless.  This is definitely a DO NOT BUY unless you like a lot of frustration with broken parts and no customer service.

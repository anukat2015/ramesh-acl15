Title: Noisy, but does the job
Content:
We purchased this heater to solve two problems: 1) our bathroom is too cold 2) the heater we use loses settings when power is off.
To me there is no bigger pain than having to get down on my knees to reconfigure the heater because the power went off or I want to move the heater. This heater has two knobs; one for hi vs lo and the other for temperature. I tried to use it to maintain the temperature in the bathroom, but decided against it partly because the unit is too noisy as indicated in other reviews and partly because it has to run too much. A third reason is that the thermostat on it does not have enough hysteresis and turns the unit on and off and on and off too much.
I like the heater's heat output, however. After a shower, I do not like being cold so I set the unit to run on hi for about a half hour before I use the shower, then turn it way down (off) when I am done using the bathroom (or when it gets too warm). The other resistance heaters could run for hours and not get the room warm enough for me. This one can do it at the low setting, but I like the higher one! I do not recommend the heater for space heating although it will work (noisy), rather for warming you up and keeping you warm while you are in the room. I give it a five for that!!

Title: But wait, a second recall
Content:
Yes The recall was a hassle and the whole time it was gone I panicked I might have been scammed, but last week the camera was back. However as I was opening some package a few days ago it found it to be empty box, but with further searching I found  a letter from Nikon. They want it back again. Shouldn't someone from Nikon be trying to contact people personally? I have not even held the camera in my hot little hands for more than a day and now I have to give it bacK Again? I bought my first Nikon in the early 70's and have upgraded when needed. I have never heard of this . Nikon should send us all new cameras, then we can send the bad one in. I like the camera and really don't want to give it up again.

Title: Good Product
Content:
We are still testing out the shuffle. Amazon was quick to ship and as usual, had an excellent price. If it's anything like our G1 shuffle, I'm sure it'll be great. Very compact and has a strong clip. The clip is strong enough that we returned the armband we purchased.

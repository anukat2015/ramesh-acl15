Title: Nikon D3000 and accessory kit including  Nikon Gadget bag
Content:
After months of research I finally settled on the D3000 as my first DSLR. Next came the search for the best price. 
As for the price the camera, lens and accessories included in the deal offered by Cameta Camera through Amazon can not be beat. With 8GB memory card, lens and gadget bag and extra battery the camera is ready to go right out of the box (after charging the battery, of course).
As for the camera I have been very happy. I have had a number of blurry shots but I truly believe that it is my lack of experience and not the camera. I am sure that the more I use the camera the better I will become.
Delivery time was great, my gadget bag was on back order and it still arrived within a week.
Great Price and speedy delivery who can ask for more

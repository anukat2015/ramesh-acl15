Title: Don't join the " Gateway Nightmare Club"
Content:
I don't own this specific model, however I did purchase the Gateway DS 450XL.  My laptop worked well for a year and then the nightmare began. The harddrive and screen went bad.  I didn't worry because I had purchased the 3 year warranty. After exhanging numerous calls and shipping my laptop back to Gateway. The lapto was returned.  It worked well for 2 weeks.  I called Gateway again we spent 45 min. attempting the fix the problem.  This was unsuccessful.  They wanted me to pay another $40 to send the computer back to them .  THe service is unsatisfactory and the computer had never worked properly since the first year.  Owning a Gateway Product is a nightmare and trying to keep their produts running well is a full time job.  I will NEVER purchase another Gateway product.  I wouldn't even accept one as a gift.

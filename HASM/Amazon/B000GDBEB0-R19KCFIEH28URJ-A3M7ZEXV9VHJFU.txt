Title: AMCOR PLM140000E
Content:
NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS THE AMCOR PLM140000E. KEEPS SHUTING DOWN DUE TO THE AFCI CIRCUIT BREAKER. THE TIME CAN BE SET USING REMOTE BUT TO SET TIME ON THE ACUTAL UNIT ONLY THE HOURS WILL WORK THE MINUTE FUNCTION WON'T BLINK TO SET. ALSO THE ROOM TEMPERATURE IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW ON THE FRONT OF UNIT BUT IT ONLY WILL DISPLAY THE SELECTED OPERATING TEMPERATURE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD A REVIEW TO READ PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE. I WAS ALSO TO RECEIVE A FREE AIR PURIFIER WITH MY ORDER. THIS HAS NOT ARRIVED YET AND THE STORE (AIR-N-WATER) HAS DUMPED THE WHOLE PROBLEM IN MY LAP TO TAKE CARE W/AMCOR DIRECTLY. OF COURSE CAN'T GET THROUGH TO AMCOR.

Title: Just what we wanted!!
Content:
We are certified "gadget gurus" so this machine was totally for us.  Not to mention we LOVE coffee!  My husband french-presses Starbucks for us every morning, which, if you are a "french-presser" you know you just can't get a better cup of coffee---but it has its limits in terms variety and flexibility and takes a good amount of effort.  We wanted the machine so we could have more variety and have a cup whenever we felt like it without the hassle.  We are so glad we went for the "upgrade" and got the B-70.  It is so sleek.  They suggest keeping the power on at all times so it is ready to go.  It literally takes 30 seconds and its ready to sip!  It takes me longer than that to choose which mug to use! ;)
We are hoping Starbucks gets on board and starts making K-Cups---but until then, we are going to use the "My K-Cup" filter.  Just picked it up today and plan on breaking it in tomorrow!

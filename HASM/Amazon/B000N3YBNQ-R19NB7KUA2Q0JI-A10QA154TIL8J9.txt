Title: Great vacuum
Content:
I actually bought this vacuum a couple of years ago when I was moving and my vacuum cleaner suddenly stopped working.  As a result, I paid full price for it, but I have never regretted it. It cleans far better than any other vacuum I have had. I am now moving from a one level home to a two-level home and am considering buying a second one. True, it lacks attachments, but a little handheld vacuum easily replaces them.  Highly recommended.

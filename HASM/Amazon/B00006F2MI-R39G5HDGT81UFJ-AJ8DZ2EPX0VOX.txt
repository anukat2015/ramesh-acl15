Title: Makes great coffee, and adds adventure to your day!
Content:
I've had Cuisinart Grind and Brews for 10 years now, with the old style first and now this one. 3 of the old style; first of these which just died after about 8 months of use. The positives of this one are that the coffee is very good. The negative is that it really needs to be cleaned well, and if you don't do this the day before so its dry by the morning you're in for the Cuisinart version of russian roulette. You'll either get weak coffee as the grinds get jammed up in the grinding chamber because of moisture, or you'll get coffee overflowing as grounds will get outside the filter and jam the pause and serve device. Actually, the latter happens very frequently even when the unit is clean - don't know what's up with that. All in all you probably have a 90% chance of a good cup of coffee and 10% chance of a mess.
I don't know what the usable life of a coffee maker is supposed to be but the old units died about every 2-3 years and I just bought a new one. This one has just died (grinder won't operate) after about a year and I think we'll skip a replacement and move on to a more conventional machine and use a standalone grinder.

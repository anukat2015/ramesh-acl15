Title: Really Works Well
Content:
I do not typically write reviews for products, but I have to tell you that this heater is great.  I live in So California and it does not get really cold here compared to most other states.  However, I refinish wood doors and the surrounding temperature has to be above 65 degrees for the application of varnish to come out right.  This heater heats up my 800 square foot garage to a toasty 75 degrees from a chilly 50 degrees in about an hour.  Would recommended it to anyone that needs a nice electric heater.
Be careful that before you buy this unit, you have an extra 25 or 30amp circuit breaker slot in your electrical box.

Title: Good product
Content:
I purchased this I-Pod for my 14 yr. old daughter and she loves it. You will need to download i-tunes 8.0 on your computer. The i-pod will surf the net quickly. Easy set up. Great music player. We have the 8 GB model and it holds all of her music fine. I would recommend this product. Check out the I-Phone though, you might can purchase 1 product instead of 2!

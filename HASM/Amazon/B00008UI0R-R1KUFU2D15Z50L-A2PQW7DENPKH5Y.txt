Title: I LOVE this vacuum!!!! :)
Content:
I have had this vacuum for 3 months and I absolutely love it! It has more suction compared to any stand up vacuum I have ever owned. It's bagless and I love that feature. The canister is small and requires you to dump it multiple times while vacuuming the entire house, but the results are worth it! If you dump the debris outside in a garbage can, it's not that messy. All of the filters are washable. Also, It picks cat hair up easily, another bonus. I highly recommend this vacuum!

Title: Issues with this coffee maker after 2 years
Content:
[[ASIN:B00005IBX9 Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless Steel]
I owned this coffee maker for approx 2 years and absolutely loved it. It looked great and brewed wonderful coffee. My husband and I brew a full pot of coffee every morning, and occasionally 2 pots on weekends.
However within the past 2 months I have been having issues with it either not turning on or shutting off one or more times in the middle of a brewing cycle.  Cleaning it, resetting the auto off timer, and unplugging it a while did not help. Many times I had to fiddle with the on/off toggle switch multiple times to get it to turn on.  We got nervous and started to unplug the machine when not in use. 
Finally, after some frustration, we went out and bought a new one yesterday.  I searched the internet and found other owners having the same issue and many without resolution.  Since we no longer have the proof of purchase or the original box, we could not return the maker under the warranty.  
I just wanted other consumers to know that we were willing to purchase this coffee maker again with the full understanding that it may only have a 2 year life, but others may not be satisfied with this.  I can only hope that Cuisinart has looked into this issue and has solved it.  I suggest you keep your reciept and box if you wish to return it for replacement within the warranty period.

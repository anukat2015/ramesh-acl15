Title: Very Lightweight and I love it for stairs!
Content:
I purchased this for my upstairs bonus room. I use another (expensive water filter type) vacume for the other parts of my home and it was too hard to take upstairs. I like having the different attachments for stairs and bare floors, tile, etc. The attachment for the carpet really picks up well.  I was very surprised at how well it worked because I am so used to my  other vacume working really well.  I have purchased other smaller type vacumes and they don't pickup the dirt and pet hair as well as this one does. The filter is a big plus!  The filter seems to need to be cleaned out after each use, not a problem.  I replace the filter after about 4 - 5 uses.  I have a pet though.  I do recommend this highly.

Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
This vacuum has superb suction.  You will not believe the link, dirt, dander, whatever this little "sucker" picks up. HOWEVER, I have had mine only since the end of April/1st of May and the carpet brush has stopped working unless you use the wand like a pool cue meaning it has to be parallel to the floor.  You cannot stand upright if you want the carpet brush to rotate.  There's an obvious short.  You'd think this would be an easy fix.  Since I live on Oahu, there is NO Factory Repair Center in the islands and Hoover will NOT allow for any return of the merchandise AT ALL after 90 days.  They keep giving me the same numbers - and the numbers aren't even correct, area code is incorrect - for businesses who will do factory repairs.  I have called these local businesses and have been told they do NOT do factory repair.  Hoover is now failing to respond to any emails I send to the contact email center on their website.  Hoover has offered NO other options for me.  I will either have to pay to have this repaired ON MY OWN or simply buy the more expense alternative vacuum I started to buy to begin with.  Believe me, it's not easy bending over or laying on the floor to make the carpet brush rotate.  You would think a company this size would at least offer a refund of the repair costs since my vacuum is in warranty.  JUST BEWARE, be sure there is a factory repair center close enough to you and that you have called that location to be sure they do Hoover factory repairs because you are going to get NOWHERE with the Hoover company on your own.

Title: Unhappy and upset
Content:
I am really upset with this vacuum. The first time I used it the belt came off and the carpet vacuum would not work. I had to go find a vacuum dealer who sold this type of belt. I was then told that Hoover is no longer in business (probably why this vacuum was on sale). Had I known this I would never have purchased this vacuum. The second time I used the vacuum, the same thing happened, the belt came off AGAIN! If you plan to purchase this vacuum, be sure to have plenty of belts available. I bought three. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone.

Title: Nice Laptop but full of BLOATWARE
Content:
I'm a very experienced computer user; more than a so called "power user".  The first thing I always do immediately after purchasing a new system is format, delete partitions, create new partition and install a fresh copy of my OS of choice.  I like Win 7 64 bit, which this laptop comes loaded with, BUT THERE ARE NO DISCS INCLUDED!! Major mistake on ACER's part.  The laptop is full of bloatware/nagware/etc. I know computer mfrs make money from software companies by installing this crap, but I hate it.  I sent ACER an email concerning this, but not a response at all.  I've heard bad things about ACER's lack of customer support and I'm beginning to believe it.
I did however get a good deal on this machine. $497.00 out the door - sales tax and all.  It's for my Daughter's graduation/birthday/beginning college.  It's fast, 4gigs (New Intel i3/4 gigs 1066Mhz DDR3/1066 Front Side Bus/320 HDD/LED/etc. (see tech specs). I like the rounded blue case.  Nice feeling keys/touch pad as well.
Not full (1080P) HD, however downloaded HD vids and DVDs look pretty good. This Aspire is not able to play today's top 3D games with full blown eye candy (but my Daughter is going into Pre-Law and not computer graphics :)
If bloatware and being unable to reload OS (with an included disc - there are other ways however) is of importance to you, please be forwarned.

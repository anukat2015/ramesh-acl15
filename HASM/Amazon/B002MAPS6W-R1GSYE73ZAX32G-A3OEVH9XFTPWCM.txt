Title: Excellent choice for music...
Content:
This player is excellent for my music only needs. The microsd storage card slot is a bonus. It is extremely small. Sound quality is excellent. You can play shuffle from folders but does not randomize very well between sessions. The screen is easy to read and the menus are user friendly. Headphones are not very good quality though, so plan on getting better ones. I ended up purchasing the Sennheiser CX380's which sound great and are moisture resistant. They got really good reviews as well. Overall this is a great value.

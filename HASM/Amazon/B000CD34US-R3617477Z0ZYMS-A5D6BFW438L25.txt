Title: Poor overall quality, bad service
Content:
I've had this stove about a year. I've had nothing but problems since day 1. Things keep breaking, I can usually fix them myself, but it's a real headache having to pull the whole thing apart for the repair.
Cleaning it is a real pain. It's noisy (moreso than other stoves I've looked at). From day 1 it was obvious the finish quality it poor, screws are cross-threaded from the factory, cheap rivets that hold the lid on popped off, seal around glass began disintegrating immediately. The electronics are clunky, hard to use, and sometimes have a 'mind of their own'
Two weeks ago in the middle of the cold winter (and about a week outside of warranty), the auger motor went out. I immediately ordered a new one ($130 for just this one small motor!). I haven't gotten it, I called them today, it hadn't even shipped yet! You think they'd be more considerate and timely in shipping parts knowing that people rely on their products for heat.
If you must get a corn stove, which after owning one I can definitely recommend NOT (your homeowners insurance will go up, it's a real hassle, gets dust all over your house, it's not as much cheaper with rising corn prices etc), if you must stay far far away from the American Harvest and US Stove models.

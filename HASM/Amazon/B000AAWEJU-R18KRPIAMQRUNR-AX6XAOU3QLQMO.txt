Title: Slob in love
Content:
I love having a clean house, but I hated vacuuming with my old vacuum, some cheap-o upright.  Vacuuming is a breeze and maybe a little fun with the Miele Carina. I suffer from allergies, have a dog, and live really close to a busy L.A. freeway, I need to  vacuum every two days. I have all wood floors in my small cottage style house, this vacuum works great for me, it might not be the best for someone with carpets. One bag lasts me about a month. It does cost about twice the price of most vacuums but it is worth it.

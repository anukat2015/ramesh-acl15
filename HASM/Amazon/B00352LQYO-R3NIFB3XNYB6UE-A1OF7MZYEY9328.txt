Title: Great Laptop! Optimus Rocks!!!
Content:
I just ordered this laptop last week and I love it!  The keyboard is the best I've ever used.  The Core i5 is the best of both world's for a CPU because it is much faster than the i3, but doesn't suck up power like the i7's.  I don't really game on the computer, but I'm sure it can run whatever.  I run numerous programs simultaneously and it doesn't ever even hiccup. 
The Optimus GPU is amazing! I can guaranty that virtually every laptop will have this technology in the next year.  Don't buy a laptop without this feature! The speakers don't sound great to me, but I'm used to my Bose Companion 3's, so I'm a bit spoiled I guess. 
One issue though.... yesterday when I turned it on, there where lines across the screen.  I had to restart it twice, but now it has been working fine ever since.  I'm not too worried about it though- when you send in the registration it bumps up your warranty to TWO YEARS GLOBAL!  Wow!!!

Title: Excellent Camera!
Content:
After being one of the last die-hard darkroom photographers in my area, I finally took the plunge and went digital.  I upgraded from a Nikon 6006 35mm, to the D80.  Features are similar to my older Nikon so the learning curve was not too difficult.  I also have a large collection of AF lenses that all work perfect with the D80.  Picture quality far surpasses that of the 6006 (although it is hard to compare Digital vs. Film).  All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend the D80 to anyone.

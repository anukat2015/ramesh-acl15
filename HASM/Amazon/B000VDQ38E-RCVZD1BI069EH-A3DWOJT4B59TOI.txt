Title: All your work undone!
Content:
I have had the pet hair eraser for a little less than a year. It works like any other vacuum but the dirt container only opens from the bottom and gets full really fast so when you empty it, all your hard work is undone.  Pet hair and dust and dirt fall out all over the place.  It is very frustrating

Title: First SLR camera, and loving it
Content:
Not much to say here other than we love like this camera. There is a lot to it. I had to order one of those cd's on learning more about the camera. Great camera for someone that like hands on experiments. 
ONE BIG ADVICE. 
If you are going to use this as a point and shot camera then you are wasting your money. Ever since we got this camera I have only used the auto setting on a few occasion, other than when I first got it it's always been  on the custom mode. I find that I have more of a control on what my pictures are going to look like. Sometimes they come out good and sometimes they don't, but that's all about learning. 
Great camera. Can't wait to upgrade my lens.

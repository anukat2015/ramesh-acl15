Title: bag way too small
Content:
this is a good vacuum but the bags are way too small and has a short power cord. powerful suction and is nice and compact. very easy to carry it around in your hand while vacuuming.if i knew the bags were that small i would have never bought it.you can get larger bags for the same price on a lager canister that would last alot longer.

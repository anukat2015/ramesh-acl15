Title: One of the best purchases I ever made!
Content:
I LOVE this coffee maker! I was a bit worried when I first decided to give it a try because a few of the reviews said that the coffee is weak when brewed at the large cup setting and I do like a nice, big mug of strong, bold coffee. However, I found this not to be the case. I always make sure to use the extra bold, dark roast k-cups and have never had a problem with weak coffee. I comes out flavorful and never bitter with no clean-up or fuss. It's also great for having company over because I can make "custom orders." I have a friend who only likes vanilla coffee, sisters who only drink decaf and cousins who only drink tea and I can accomodate them all with one machine. Great product!

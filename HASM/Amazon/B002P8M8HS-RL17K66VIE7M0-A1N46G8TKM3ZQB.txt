Title: Great for all-in-one Laptop, but don't count on the speakers
Content:
This is my second Toshiba Satellite laptop, the first was purchased 4 years ago and came with Windows XP. I bought another not because of any major problems with the old one, but simply to have Windows 7 on a nice, new machine. Toshiba does a great job in the mid-range laptop market. It's lighter than I expected, came with an expanded keyboard and a wide screen perfect for movie watching. While the Satellite handles video well, comes with a built-in microphone and webcam--sound is a major issue. If you like to use your laptop as a music player, definitely invest in some speakers because the ones in the machine are inaudible from a different room or with even the slightest background noise. Aside from the sound issue (common to many laptops), I found nothing to fault in the Satellite. Windows 7 is a definite improvement over XP and the screen is capable of high-resolution video. Battery life is shortened due to the size of the screen and computing power. I can go over two hours without a charge, more in economy mode. Students who plan on taking this to class may be better off with a more portable Toshiba model that includes a long-lasting battery. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase and confidant in its lasting another four years.

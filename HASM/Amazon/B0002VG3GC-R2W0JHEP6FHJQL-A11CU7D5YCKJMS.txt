Title: Shipping review...
Content:
The item is still not in hand.  I read other people's reviews, luckily, so I was aware that the item might not be coming quickly and, true to form, it has not.  Shipping has been bumped back twice.  The other items I ordered, on the same day, got here weeks ago, (probably about a month ago).  SO, based on shipping, I am giving a poor review.  Amazon *should* update the site to warn folks that the item is NOT shipped right off and Amazon should also have it's sellers being accurate about the shipping times also.
Once I get the item, (which, hopefully, won't be TOO much longer), I'll do a review of it.
Hope the item is better than the shipping.  :)

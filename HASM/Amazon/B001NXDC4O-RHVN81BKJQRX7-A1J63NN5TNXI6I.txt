Title: SUPERB is not the word
Content:
Ok where do I begin with the S9, my brother was crazy about his Cowon D2, and I was crazy about my Itouch 8GIG, I thought apple was the best, and he kept telling me it's garbage. He lives in the Island of Jamaica and I live in the states. I went to Jamaica in the summer of 08 and I checked out the COWON D2, and to my surprise, the D2 won the battle in sound quality, I had to admit. Right there and then, I understood that Cowon is GREAT! company. Hence, when the S9 came out, I knew that I had to take advantage of it; therefore, I sold My Itouch and bought this immaculate device, due to the fact that it was made with OLED screen, future proof tech, plus I knew it had better sound than than the D2. I didn't really see too much competition out there. 
NOW I DON'T HAVE TO CONVERT MY MOVIES, YEEAAAHHHH!. Just throw them on and go, the video quality is the best, it's like a mini blu ray. Plus it has the FM radio and the fact that you can record your voice and the radio, is simply wonderful. Now, for extra stuff and Perfect GUI, you won't find all of this in the COWON S9. I sort of miss the Itouch for that; but when I hear the music and I begin to watch movies, all that other stuff goes out the window. I have bought things in my life that I somewhat regret, but buying this MP3 player is the best decision I've made in a while. YOU'LL HEAR MUSIC in a new light, buy it! you won't regret it. However, I must mention, you'll probably find the player a little cumbersum in the beginning, but believe me, you will eventually get use to it, and in turn appreciate the ease of use while navigating and understanding it.
ENJOY! because I AM LOVIN' IT

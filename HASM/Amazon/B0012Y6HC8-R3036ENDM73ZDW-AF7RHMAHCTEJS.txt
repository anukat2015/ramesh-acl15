Title: Wasted my hard earned dollars
Content:
I researched for 6 months before buying this camera and then the upgrade 17-85 IS lens, and thought I had found my perfect camera and lens with live view and all.
I noticed right out of the box that all my images were soft but I figured it will take time to get it dialed in.  Four months later and a thousand pictures and settings and I wish I had bought the Nikon D40 for 1/2 the cost or D60.  My $1200 system with the upgrade lens takes pictures that time after time are not as in focus as D40 with Kit lens that has no image stabilization.  The only shots that even come close are done with live view and manual focusing and then edited heavily. 
 .... Update to above review... I returned my camera to Canon for repair.  I just got it back and they made adjustments in the camera's electronics and I do notice an improvement.  I will not get rid of the camera after all.  To bad quality control could not get it right the first time. I had no trouble with Canon and the warrantee.

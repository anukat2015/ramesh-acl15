Title: Perfect for small, enclosed rooms
Content:
This heater works wonders in my uninsulated 10'x11'x10' bedroom. The fan does make moderate amounts of noise, especially when it clicks on and off, but it hasn't bothered me at all- even while I'm sleeping. The directions say to aim it across the room, unobstructed, straight at a wall, which does actually seem to help the air temperature remain pretty even throughout the room. I've tried using it in another room in my house, which is 13'x13'x10', but it wasn't powerful enough for that room. (I got a DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator for the larger room, which works great, but there's not enough space in my crowded bedroom for this type of heater.) The Vornado heater is perfect because it doesn't take up much space, I just put it on my bookshelf, but it effectively heats my whole room. I wouldn't recommend it for large or open spaces though.
My favorite feature is the thermostat which gives a read out of the current temperature as well as the temperature that you have set it to. A lot of space heaters have rather arbitrary temperature settings, so it's nice to have a thermostat that actually has settings in degrees fahrenheit.

Title: Good only for about 9 months!
Content:
Reecived this as a Christmas present last year, but it took two months of moving before I could actually use it. Once I did, the travel mugs lasted about a week before the bottoms came off and they had to be thrown away due to rough bottom edges. No big deal I thought, I will just use other travel mugs. That lasted for about six months. The coffee it brews is HORRIBLE tasting! I have ran the "residue cleaners" through it, like all my past coffeemakers, and it just won't come back to its days of making a decent cup of coffee. Too bad I had a convenient coffeemaker for about 9 months!

Title: Great MP3 player, especially for price I paid
Content:
I bought this for my wife for christmas and we've had it for almost a month now and we haven't had a problem out of it.  I installed RockBox firmware, it seems to have more options to it than the original firmware but if you don't know much about computers/mp3 players I'd stick with the original firmware, it worked fine just not as much you can play with.  The battery life isn't quite as long as they advertise but it's good enough.  Overall it was a great purchase!

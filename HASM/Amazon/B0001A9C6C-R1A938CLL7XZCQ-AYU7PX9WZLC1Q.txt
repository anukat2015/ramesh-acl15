Title: SO darn small
Content:
Honestly, to understand how cool the ipod mini is you have to hold it.  It is so small, light and solid feeling.  I can say without a doubt in my mind that as far as far as practical value goes, this is the best MP3 player money can buy.  It is small and light enough to disappear in your pocket, easy enough to navigate that about 5 minutes of use makes it second nature, and it is tough enough to stand up to any a lot of abuse without even showing a scratch.  You can buy an MP3 player with more space for a less or equal amount of money, but the hidden and most important value that a consumer electronic device can have is usability - what I mean is how seamlessly it can slide into your life.  If you get an ipod mini, you'll never have to deal with the frustrations that a heavier, less reliable and more complicated and not as smooth and agreeable looking device present.  In short, you'll take this whereever you go because its one of those devices that you'll never (figuratively) trip over.

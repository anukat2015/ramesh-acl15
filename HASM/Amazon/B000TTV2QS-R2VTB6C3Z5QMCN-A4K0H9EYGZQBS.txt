Title: Do not ever rely on this heater...
Content:
I bought this heater twice. The first one worked well for three days and suddenly it shut down and I couldn't turn it on. Then I placed a replacement request and got a new one and same problem occurred with the second one too. I read the instructions and there's nothing on the manual that is related to this problem. Then I did some research on this heater and saw that Lasko recalled 1.2 million heaters because of the high risk of fire hazard due to the overheating of heaters' cables. 
Therefore, I don't think these incidents are simple coincidences. I will return these two heaters and will never buy a Lasko product again. Just don't forget that it's very inconvenient not being able to turn the heater on when it's very cold inside.

Title: If you want HOT Coffee...
Content:
Then this is not the machine for you.  The thermal carafe doesnt have a burner, so the coffee is never very hot.  I prefer HOT coffee myself, this machine makes it semi-hot if you're drinking it black, but once you put cream in it, you have to throw your cup in the microwave.
I have looked for a setting to jack up the temp, but there is none.  Great features - programming/ 2-cup pot, but bottom line - it doesnt brew hot coffee.

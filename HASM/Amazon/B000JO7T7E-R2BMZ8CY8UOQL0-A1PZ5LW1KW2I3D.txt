Title: Love my new iPod!
Content:
My brother bought me this iPod for my birthday to replace my old 1st Generation Nano and I love it! The display is bright and I like when the iPod goes idol it displays the time. The cover flow is really fun to look at. Great iPod! Plus it comes in a really cute color, pink!

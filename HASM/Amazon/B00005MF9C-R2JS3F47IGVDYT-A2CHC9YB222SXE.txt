Title: I love this thing!
Content:
This little coffee maker is a dream come true. Amazon shipped it really quickly, and it was in great shape when it got here. It's a nice size and will fit right into a little corner in your kitchen. The cup Black & Decker provides is the perfect size, and the lit fits on nice and tight so you never have to worry about leakage. The best part is how fast this thing makes your coffee! It immediately begins working on your brew within about 10 seconds of turning it on, and a full cup is done in about 2.5 minutes. I really love the investment I made in this.

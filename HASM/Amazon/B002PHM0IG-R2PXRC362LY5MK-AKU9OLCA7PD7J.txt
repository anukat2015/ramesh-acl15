sooooo, first day i got this laptop i set it up..no problem (or so i thought)... quick set up! no disk required. Attempted to skype my friend and realized there was no sound!! so i went to shut down the laptop and see if it would fix itself once it restarted. To my surprise the password that i set it up with DID NOT WORK!!(and yes it was the right password) So at this point im pissed. Brand new laptop no sound? and passeword doesnt work?
ok so i call sony. They can do nothing for the computer except a reset (which they claim will fix the sound tpo). So i spend 2 hours restoring my computer to factory settings ughhhhh. 
this time im smart :) i dont set the computer up with a password. but still no sound!! call sony back and they have me reinstall the drivers. that doesnt work. so they say there is nothing they can do for the computer except send a tech out. So as of now i am still waiting for the tech to call me.. 
i DO like the laptop i just wish the sound would work, ughhhh kinda of disappointing

Title: A mighty little machine.
Content:
I bought this vacuum from the Shoplet company on Amazon. I am amazed at how well it works for something so small. First of all, the item practically arrived overnight and I did not pay to expedite shipping. It was a cinch to put together and it works so well.
It really gets my hardwood and tile floors so clean. It also works well on lite rugs, we have dhurries. I am not sure how well it would work on deep pile carpets. I also have used its attachments to clean my furniture. That was great too.  I especially like the fact that it is a bagged vacuum as I thought cleaning out the dust cup from my previous one was disgusting. And last but not least, it fits under most of my furniture, unlike the previous one which was a clunky upright.
It is easy to use and incredibly light, the hose does not tangle and it follows along behind me like a little red dog.
I would suggest buying several packages of bags when you buy the vacuum.
A great machine especially for the money.
Well, thought I would check back in, it is now May 2009, almost a year of ownership. And I still love this product. I still find it really loud so now I wear my IPOD when I vac. But aside from that it is really nice. It picks up and it is not a pain to lug around. I don't expect it to live forever especially since I seem to be really hard on vac's but for sure I would another one of these.

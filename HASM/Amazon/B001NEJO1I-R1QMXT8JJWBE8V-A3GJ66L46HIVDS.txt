Title: Good all around machine.
Content:
If you want a well built, reliable laptop ... this is it.  The standard configuration and set-up are good.  The machine itself is quiet, with just a slight hum from the fan.  I've been able to use the battery for over 3 hours reliably with multiple applications running.  And, it doesn't get hot at all.
I'm not as tech-savvy as some commenters here.  But, for general use in our household, my kids easily watch Netflix videos, are able to game online, load their MP3 players with music, and I can listen to Pandora and run MS Office products without any hangups.
The screen is bright and the colors pop.  The speakers are more than adequate for built-in laptop speakers.  I'd get another one without hesitation, especially knowing Toshiba products are reliable.  This is our second, my wife uses hers constantly without issues throughout the day in her home-work needs.

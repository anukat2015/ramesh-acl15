Title: Great Laptop but it's gets really hot.
Content:
I've got this laptop from dell's website 3 years ago when it and core 2 was first released. The quality of this laptop is very good. I also added the following features to it: firewire, webcam, bluetooth, 120GB HD and 9 cells battery which still has a capacity of 3:50 hours when running under high performance settings.
There's nothing I can say about specifications other than that I'm using Windows 7 on it now which is a bit lighter than Vista Business that came installed on this laptop. The Media button feature is nice but I rarely use it, specially that unlike Vista, Windows 7 has Media center built in it's business version.
This laptop is heavy and it gets really hot to a level that you can't put it on your lap. So if you are looking for a mobile laptop, you need to look somewhere esle.

Title: I love Apple products - but this is absolute junk
Content:
I don't know how Apple let this product make it into the stores.  Many people buying this iPod will want to use it while exercising.  Good luck.  Why?  As soon as any sweat makes its way to the control panel on the earphone cord, the unit goes nuts - my volume suddenly went to maximum, and songs started skipping from one to the next.  This isn't an isolated problem either.  Wait for the next generation - this one isn't worth anything.  Mine is sitting unused at home - I would much rather carry the bigger iPhone to the gym than try to deal with this poorly designed unit.

Title: I wish I could give it Zero Stars!!!
Content:
Heater worked fine first year of ownership.  Pulled it out the closet this fall and saw little wisps of smoke coming out.  I figured it was just dust burning off, but after a few minutes a saw and heard some pretty big sparks coming from it. Luckily I turned it off before it caught fire like some of the other unfortunate reviewers here!!!

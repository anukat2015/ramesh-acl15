Title: Fine machine with a few lil things
Content:
It's a great machine. It's light. It's really thin. It performs like a big ol' laptop. I don't know about massive performance - I'm not a gamer... just a guy who uses a laptop for work, surfing, writing, editing pics, videos. And it works really well.
The funk comes with the touchpad and click bar. And the scroll buttons. Other odd keyboard anomalies. But with a small wireless mouse and some getting used to the layout, it's going to be fine. (But really, the mouse and click bar thing really sucks.)
Overall I'm really happy not lugging my big heavy short-battery-life-with-a-list-of-things-that-just-stopped-working-HP 6100 series laptop around. This machine is a refreshing change in weight and function. (So many HP computers out there for so little money, but I won't ever buy another one. What a piece...)
The included external optical drive didn't work right out of the box, but I found the MSI tech support in L.A. to be efficient and quick with the RMA.

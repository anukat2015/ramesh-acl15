Title: Great laptop
Content:
I received this laptop as a birthday gift in August, and I love it very much. Although this isn't the exact model that I have it is very similar. The only differences with mine is the model number. Mine is the L505-S5971. The other difference is that mine doesn't have all the other keys that are next to the power button up top. It's still a wonderful laptop. My first laptop was the HP COMPAQ that I bought myself in 2005. It has lasted me until it finally conked out on me completely this past July. So I definitely got my money's worth out of it. Hopefully this one will do the same. I love the features that it has on there. Although I must admit I do not know all of the technical stuff and what it means but it's allowing me to do things on here that I wasn't able to do on my COMPAQ. Great laptop. I definitely recommend this product. Whichever model you get from Toshiba. I'm very happy with mine.

Title: I love this computer!
Content:
I do a variety of freelance video and photo work. 
This laptop has the RAM and hard drive space to make it great for productions and editing on the go. 
The firewire port is especially useful for hooking up a camcorder and recording directly to the laptop, or for transferring DV tapes from the camcorder to digital format. 
The webcam and built in microphone are good for video-conferencing and impromptu video-blogging. 
This computer is a great deal for the multi-media oriented buyer!

Title: Select is better than I expected
Content:
My old Flip-It died after 3 years of use, I loved it and wanted another - when I saw this one with the heat option I wondered if it was much better and you know, I think it is!  I used it on my tile floors in my new home and couldn't believe how much dirt was there that I didn't even see.  The vac part is really only for the times that you see a little schmutz that you need to get up while mopping, not really for cleaning entire floors (buy a good vac for that) and it's great to just flip it and suck it up without having to stop what you're doing. This product saves a ton of time and no back aches from lifting water buckets.  I can't wait until I get my new hardwood floors so I can try it on those. My old flip-it worked wonderfully on hardwood.

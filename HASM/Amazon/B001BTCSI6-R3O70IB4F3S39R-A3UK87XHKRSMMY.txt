Title: The D700 really is as good as all the reviews (D300 Owner)
Content:
With many very positive reviews already written there is not a lot to add.  I have a D300 and was very pleased with it but the high iso capability of the D700 intriuged me.  Having used the camera some, the high iso capability is extraordinary - I took a black & white shot at ISO 25,000 that actually looked pretty good (looked like B&W film pushed).  DX lenses are usable but not the first choice with this camera.  I will continue to use my D300 for long telephotos in most cases.  However, if light is an issue - I will always use the D700 even with telephoto shots.
Not too many negatives with this camera at all. If I had to pick one it would be the lack of a 100% view finder (the D300 sploiled me there)-- but it is a minor flaw.  Great camera and I feel like I made an excellent decisionn to purchase it.

Title: Excellent small format laptop
Content:
Everything about the machine is a joy.  Of course, it is stylish.  And the size is great if you are going to be carrying it around a lot as I do.  (I had a hard time finding a good laptop with all the things I wanted that didn't weight about 7 or 8 pounds).  On a practical level, it really delivers.  The keyboard, with the chiclet keys, is very ergonomic.  The extra function buttons are useful.  The page up/page down/home/end keys all require the use of a function key with them.  For some programs, this means you'll need to depress three keys to complete an activity.  But the use of space on the keyboard overall is very good.  And while it does come with some crapware, that is easily removed.  The VAIO update function keeps up with necessary driver updates for you.  Win 7 Home Premium is a big step up in performance, reliability and security from XP, and the machine boots very rapidly.  On the downside, it does not come with a CD of the operating system for use in recovery.

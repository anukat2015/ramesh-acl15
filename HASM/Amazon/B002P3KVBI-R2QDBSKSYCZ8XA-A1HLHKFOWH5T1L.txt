Title: Excellent choice, far more useable than netbook.
Content:
This computer is just a bit larger than a netbook, but offers much more computing power and a much more useable keyboard for modestly more in price.
Pros:
1) 2 GB memory standard.
2) 64 Bit Windows 7 Home Prem.
3) SU2300 processor is able to run powerful applications including Windows 7 Pro with XP Mode, Dragon Naturally Speaking, VirtualBox.
4) Long battery life.
5) Display bright enough for outdoor use.
7) Can playback HD content from Netflix online and iTunes without stuttering.
8) Lightweight
9) Battery does not stick out of computer like netbooks.
Cons:
1) Needed to update firmware to allow use of XP Mode.
2) 11.6 inch display is small - a limitation of the basic form factor.
3) Web cam not as good as on MacBooks
4) Win 7 still not as useable as Mac OS X.
5) Glossy display is inferior to matte, but seems to be the prevailing industry trend.
For the price, it is highly recommendable.  Hopefully durability will be good.

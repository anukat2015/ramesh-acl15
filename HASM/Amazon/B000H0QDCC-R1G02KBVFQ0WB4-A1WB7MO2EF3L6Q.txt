Title: What a product
Content:
I purchased my Zune about a month ago, had no problems installing the software on my PC.  I am 60 years old and really enjoy using my Zune with the Shuffle All option, 'cause then I am not listening to one artist all the time.  Also, I really like the FM tuner.  I have the option to listen to the radio for even more music.  I bought the 30GB but I really think I could have gotten by with an 8GB.  The Zune 30GB is a bit big and a little heavier but I do like the big screen.

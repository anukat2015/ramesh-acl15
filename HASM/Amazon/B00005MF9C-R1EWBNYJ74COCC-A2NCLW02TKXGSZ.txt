Title: Great Coffee maker for one!
Content:
I got this coffee maker for Christmas and I have used it every day since. The only time I've had any problems with it, is when I put in too much water (fill to just *slightly* below the max fill line in the reservoir) or when I put in too many coffee grounds (use the recommended 2.5 tablespoons or else it will overflow slightly). I am very happy with it overall.
The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is because: there are little holes in the handle underneath that rub against my finger when I'm drinking. Not a big deal, just had to adjust the way I hold the cup. I would also like to be able to buy an additional cup so I have have a spare. If I could have rated it 4.5 stars, I would.
I haven't tried using disposable filters, but I plan to do so soon.

Title: Great Camera Any Accessory You Want
Content:
I bought the D50 kit with the 14-55 mm lens.  At the same time I bought the 70-300mm Nikkor lens designed for the D70.  It takes almost any Nikon(Nikkor) autofocus lens, all of the Nikon knock-off lenses like Sigma,  all of their speedlights etc.
This camera takes unbelivable pictures.  With the 70-300mm lens I took pictures from fair territory in the upper deck of Yankee Stadium at a night game.  I have shots where you can see the ball (clearly) coming off the bat.  Unbeleivable - I had to be 450 feet away at night.  This was using auto exposure and autofocus.
It is great for action shots.  I have used it for portraits, cross country meets, and snapshots on a cruise.  All come out great.
I have just boght the Nikkor 28-200mm zoom so I don't have to change lenses at track meets.  
My recomendation would be to get the body only and the Nikkor 28-200 mm lens.  It is expensive at $369, but is probably the only lens you will ever need even for sporting events.

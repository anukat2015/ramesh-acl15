This is without a doubt the best electric room heater I have ever used.  Because of the vortex, the area in front of the heater seems cool and you wonder if it's working.  But somehow or other it it heats up the whole room (rather quickly), instead of just the area in front of it.  It's really a wonderful heater.  Yep it's a tad expensive; but it's really worth it.  The Vornado VH2 looks nice, is quiet, and does an outstanding job.  Prices really vary a lot and you can easily pay way too much - but Amazon has great comparative pricing, and can help you save a bundle!

Title: Hoping that 2nd one is the charm
Content:
The first one I ordered died within about 26 days of delivery.  I barely got an exchange through Amazon.  Here's hoping the second one lasts.  With the working one in mind, so far so good.  Coffee is extra hot (so long as you rinse carafe in hot water before using). We nuke our milk before adding it to coffe, but that's a personal choice.  The coffee itself is pretty hot.  Coffee remains hot hours later.  Coffee tastes great.  Coffee takes no time to brew.  Permanent filter requires less coffee than paper, e.g. it actually uses 1 scoop per cup, and the scoop that's provided is less than an actual tablespoon.  It is a little awkward to pour water  into tank, but solution is to use a glass to pour it rather than the carafe and to turn the machine around so that it faces you.  It's not rocket science.We especially enjoy the ability to make just one cup or as many as ten.  Makes it much more versatile than most coffee makers.  If you're looking for a good machine that will allow you to make a little or a lot of coffee and provide a great taste that gets really hot and remains so, this * should* be it.  Again, great machine, but my fingers are crossed!

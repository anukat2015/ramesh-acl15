Title: Great camera and lens for $350!!!
Content:
I could not be more satisfied with this Samsung GX-1L and Schneider D-Xenon lens.  Thanks Amazon and Buy Direct Closeout!
My first experience with SLRs was with the PENTAX Spotmatic and Kodachrome 64 in 1974.  I still get a thrill from razor sharp colorful images but now I don't have to buy the prepaid mailers and wait a week for the slides to show up in the mailbox.
For me, having the latest technology takes a back seat to price and quality. This camera takes GREAT pictures and works with all my old K mount and screw mount lenses.  Have you seen the asking prices on new lenses? Obscene! Take a look at my pictures using 40-year-old single focal length screw mount lenses on this Samsung body. Higher quality than any zoom!
I have a nifty Fuji S1000 for travel and people events. And now this GX-1L for scenic and studio. I have finally made the transition from film to digital.  That is real picture progress!

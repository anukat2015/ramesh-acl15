Title: Powerful... Maybe too powerful for your outlet
Content:
I read the product reviews and bought this because the majority of the customer ratings were 4-5's, with the biggest problem for people being the lack of an on/off switch.  However, within 2 days of using this little heater I have blown my bathroom outlet (which won't reset for some reason) and then when I plugged it into a power strip and it tripped that as well.  It works pretty good as far as giving off heat but, I must say, I am a little scared to plug it in again. I also live in an older house so purchase at your own risk:)

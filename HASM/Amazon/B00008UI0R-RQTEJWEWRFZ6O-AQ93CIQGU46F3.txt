Title: At Last.........
Content:
At last I have found the vacuum I have been endlessly searching for!
This vacuum I must say passed my critical expectations.
I have owned several Hoover vacuums-  They have served me well- But I have had some issues-  I have dogs, kids, you name it... This is the first canister I have owned- I now have mostly hardwood and tile floors...
Excellent for bare floors- Quiet too.
It has different setting for suction- I am able to vacuum my dogs with the brush accessory on a low suction setting!  It doesn't freak them out with it being so quiet.
No one ran out of the room or turned the TV volume up.  :0)  
I love it!!!!!

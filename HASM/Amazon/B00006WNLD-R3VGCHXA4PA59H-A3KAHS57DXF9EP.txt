Title: I LOVE this Item!
Content:
I purchased this for my home office and I LOVE IT! I work odd hours and don't want to run our big coffee pot at 3 in the morning - but often want a cup of coffee... this was my answer!
It is also perfet for me becasue I LOVE flavored coffees and my husband does not.  For years I have done without them becasue there is no need making them in a 10 cup pot when I am not going to drink that much coffee myself... Once again - this cup at a time pot saved the day and I have my wonderful flavored coffees again!
I use the Melitta #1 coffee filters, no grounds in my cup and SO easy to clean up!
I gave it 5 stars - but would give it even more if I could!

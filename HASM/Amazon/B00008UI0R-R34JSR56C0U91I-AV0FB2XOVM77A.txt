Title: A Value Vac!
Content:
I've had my Hoover vac for only a month, but I love it! I had an old upright and a Kenmore canister, but this canister Hoover vac is so much more powerful, light and a joy to vacum with.  I did alot of research and believe this is a great value compared to the dyson and other vacums.

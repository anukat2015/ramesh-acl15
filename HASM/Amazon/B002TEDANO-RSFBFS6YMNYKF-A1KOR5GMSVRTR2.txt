Title: Super Loaded Aspire
Content:
I've owned this computer for 3 months and it's doing a great job. It's pricy,but seems a really good quality build. I ordered mine maxed out in mem 4GB and harddrive 320.It's proclaimed 8 hr battery life may be close IF you don't use the bluetooth for mouse access. I'd recommend it to anyone needing or just wanting a really top end netbook with all the bells and whistles. oh, the HDMI output is super. giving a beautifull picture on my 65inch monitor

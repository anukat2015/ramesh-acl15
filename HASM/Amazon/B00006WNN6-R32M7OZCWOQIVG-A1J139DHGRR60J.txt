Title: Thermostat doesn't work
Content:
I have another Delonghi heater that I love, but I bought this one new, and it does not work properly.  It turns off when the room isn't warm yet even when I set it to the hottest thermostat setting.  How annoying that I can't use it to warm the room because it turns off!!

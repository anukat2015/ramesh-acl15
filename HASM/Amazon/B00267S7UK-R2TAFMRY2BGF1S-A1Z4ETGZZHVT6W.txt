Title: Your mileage may vary
Content:
I have been using Nikons for over thirty years. I am a great fan of Nikon although the price point of some of their products does not alway reflect actual quality compared to other vendors and Nikon has the same problems with production quality control as everyone else.
I knew this camera had a tiny, dim pentamirror viewing system but based on its size and sterling reviews of its D90-like auto-focus I purchased it anyway assuming I could rely on the autofocus.
The D90 is a nice size compared to larger body dSLRs and once you get used to the controls handles well. The video function is quite useful; I have never been a fan of live view. The low noise of the sensor is very impressive compared to just the prior generation of Nikon/Sony image capture devices.
Nikon now has the camera only in part because of the recall based on potential early failure of the on-off switch. I commend Nikon for taking pre-emptive action. However potential buyers of this camera should be aware of reports that virtually every D5000 currently in the reatil chain is subject to a recall for this problem.
I hope it is only my particular specimen but this camera could not reliably autofocus and systematically underexposes. 
Exposure issues are partly a matter of taste and can be easily compensated.
However the execrable viewing system forces one to rely on autofocus and this particular unit needs bifocals.
As I said, your mileage may vary.

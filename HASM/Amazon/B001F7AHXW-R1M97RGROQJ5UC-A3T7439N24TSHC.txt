Title: Good, but...
Content:
This ipod is great. has a tiny lag, but with memory like this, who gives a crap. this only thing that made me mad, was how apple stopped making those thin silk cases for the ipods. and because the back is all chrome like, it looks freaking disgusting. its just ridiculous that they would stop making something so useful.

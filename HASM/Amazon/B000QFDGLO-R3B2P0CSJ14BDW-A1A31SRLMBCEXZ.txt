Title: Good while it lasts
Content:
I've had this coffee maker since for several years now. It was an excellent coffee maker for the first year of ownership, but unfortunately it hasn't lasted as long as I would have liked.
Problem 1: From about the end of the first year, the dial to control the warming pad temperature ceased to work. It would always default to the hottest temperature no matter what setting you had it on. This lasted for about 3 months before the next problem showed up. 
Problem 2: It started spilling coffee everywhere while brewing coffee each and every time. I did do the suggested "Clean" each month I've had the machine, as mentioned in the owner's manual. It was definitely inconvenient to be no more than 5 feet away from the machine while brewing at all times. This persisted for a good year and a half before it finally decided to not work period.
Maybe I was just given a faulty model. I must say I'm not going to buy this again with the amount of problems this has given me (and reading other reviews of similar models as well)

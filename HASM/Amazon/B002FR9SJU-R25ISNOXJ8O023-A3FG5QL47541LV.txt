Title: Canon EOS Rebel T1i Bundle
Content:
After a lot of frustration of searching for this camera in the DFW metroplex (there was an apparant shortage of this model at a major camera chain), I turned to Amazon.com to find a great value that was available for my upcoming trip to Alaska.  The ordering was easy, and the shipment arrived ahead of schedule.  Additionally, I saved over $100 when compared with the local camera and big box stores.  I have told many of my great experience, and plan to purchase again with Amazon.com.
The Canon EOS Rebel T1i lives up to all the reviews I have read about, and I certainly appreciated the starter kit.  The camera bag is a bit small, but the two 8GB cards make up for this for a value purchase.  The spare battery is a must.

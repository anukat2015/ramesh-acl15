Title: Great for bird cage!
Content:
I purchased this to use on my bird cage. I have a rescue bird that was severely feather plucked. I was very concerned about keeping him warm without the worry of safety. I attached it to the outside of the cage using a home-made bracket. It works great! I leave it on 24 hours a day. When the bird needs extra warmth, he just snuggles up next to it. The other birds love it too! I feel very safe having it on all of the time as the heat source is encased in the panels. Thanks for a great product!

Title: Works for me
Content:
Personally, I haven't had any problems with the unit and enjoy its ease and convenience. Making sure to add the proper amount of coffee and keeping the permanent filter clean after each use, which is easily done, should prevent any problems with the grounds floating out of the filter into the water container. No measuring cup is necessary as using the coffee mug itself to fill the water chamber works just fine. Depending upon the hardness of ones water, following the occasional cleaning of the unit with white vinegar should keep steam to a minimum and the brewer in good shape for years to come. As for the difficulty in locating #1 paper-cone filters in lieu of the permanent mesh filter than comes with the unit, I too am unable to find any locally but noticed that they can be ordered on-line through Melitta.com for less than $2.00 for a package of 40.

Title: Buy the Grinder Separately
Content:
I love this coffee maker!  It's looks and feels substantial, and the retro design and stainless steel exterior provide a sleek look on the counter.  I was glad to FINALLY toss my OLD $100+ Cuisinart coffee maker in the trash! The old one had a built in grinder, which seemed like a clever idea when I bought it.  But, after spending the last two years cleaning this monster, I had developed a hatred for the thing.  The brewing process steamed every surface of the grinding apparatus, so the entire machine had to be thoroughly disassembled and washed every time-- and it had to be perfectly dry or it would clog up.  I would never recommend that style maker!  By contrast, this machine is easy to clean and simple in design.  It has all the features you'd want without useless bells and whistles.  The separate burr mill still gives you the fresh brew without the mess, and you just grind beans as you need them.  You don't have to refill it every time, either.  These two pieces look good together with similar style and durability.  Criticisms?  The simple liquid crystal time display is dim and hard to see during the day and unreadable at night.  More importantly, there is no external gauge or window to show you how much water you are adding.  The measurement gauge in inside the water reservoir and hard to view.  The machine sits high on my counter and it is hard to look into the reservoir if you are using a spray nozzle on the sink to fill it.  It's more accurate to fill the pot, then use that to fill the reservoir, but that takes twice as long and usually produces dribbles and spills.

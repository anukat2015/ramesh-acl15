Title: The birthday present that wasn't
Content:
Well, the Zune didn't work when I got it, so I had to make an emergency run to Walmart the night before the 13 year old's birthday and ended up spending more that I intended for an Ipod Nano. Because, well, you know, 13 is a pretty big birthday event. Then having to spend the money on the Ipod threw my budget off kilter, and OF COURSE, I had to wait for the refund from Tiger Direct, but I must admit, the return/refund process was the best part of this transaction -- it was pretty seamless and I had my money back as fast as possible.

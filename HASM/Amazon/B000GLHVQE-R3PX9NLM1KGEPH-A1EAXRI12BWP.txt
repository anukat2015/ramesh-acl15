Title: Great for the price !
Content:
We purchased this stove for our cool and drafty San Francisco living room (15' x 15').  I can't imagine a nicer room heater for the price.  The stove is stylish, and the 3D flames almost look real !  Granted, this is not a real wood fireplace, but it is a great alternative.  I like that you can turn on the flames without the heat.  The heat is warm enough for the room.  I consider this one of our favorite finds for the year !

Title: Brewing Noise?
Content:
Just picked up this machine, and so far am very happy with it. After reading reviews on here, I was expecting to hear any hardly noise during the brewing process. But the machine has a very significant rumble and minor vibration during brewing? Were previous machines (i.e. the Braun) even louder?

Title: JUST AS EXPECTED
Content:
I just received the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum. This vacuum is everything that I need it to be. Being a petite person its very difficult for me to push and pull an upright vacuum. I LOVE the fact that there is NO bags to fidget with and it has a HEPA Filter. The telescoping handle is a great feature, the WHOLE family can get involved in helping with the chores because of the adjustability of this great machine. According to the Manual it seems very affordable to buy replacement parts IF it ever comes to that. The price of this vacuum was a great deal! For what I paid and what I got I have a GOOD thing.

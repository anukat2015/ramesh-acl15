Title: Epic leap forward
Content:
Awesome picture quality, same as my D300.  It is much more plasticy than a D300, but I like it because it's much lighter and fits my hands perfectly.   There isn't an obvious video button, but it was easy to figure out once you hit the LV (live view) button it prompts you to press OK to start recording.   The top LCD screen is smaller than the D300.  The 3 inch screen is amazing, just like the D300.  This is a huge leap forward compared to the D80.   It's an even bigger leap that they've pulled off high quality video that's user friendly!  Put a Sigma 10-20mm or the Nikkor 10.5 fisheye, and you'll have some epic video shots.  The 18-105VR lens is lighter than it looks, much lighter than the 18-200VR, feels very solid and is quite smooth.  The standard definition video is good (haven't watched it on a large screen yet), and gives you 20 minute clips vs 5 min clips in HD mode.   The zoom also worked when in video mode, but the Autofocus is fixed.   Once in LiveView it takes a second to autofocus, then you can press OK and start recording.   Sound isn't stellar of course.  It has a small microphone and speaker, so you can actually hear the video your reviewing.  So far this is my favorite new gadget of 2008.  Wedding Videographer's rejoice! (i'm shooting one next week)

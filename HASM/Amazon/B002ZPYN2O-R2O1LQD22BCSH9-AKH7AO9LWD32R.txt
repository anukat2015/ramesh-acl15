Title: Amazing Machine
Content:
I got my new L505-S5988 a little over a week ago. I am very impresseed on how it handles many tasks in Windows 7 with no lag at all.  This machine is quiet, and very cool even after hours of use.  The full keboard is a nice touch and the screen is very bright and clear.  The only negatives I have on this laptop is the speakers while an impressive size for a laptop they sound quite tinny.  Besides that it is a fingerprint magnet.  Overall with an external pair of speakers and a microfiber cloth and this is a dream machine!!!

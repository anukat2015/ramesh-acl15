Title: For serious coffee drinkers
Content:
Are you serious about your coffee? Do you buy quality whole beans and grind them right before brewing? If so, you will like this coffee maker. For starters, it looks really good on the counter. For enders, it makes a very good cup of coffee. In between, there are a few things to note:
1) Even pre-heating the carafe and the cup with boiling water, the resulting brew is only 160 degrees. That might not be quite hot enough for some (20 seconds in the wave will fix it).
2) The carafe is just fine. If you can close a screen door, you can situate the carafe so that it works as planned.
3) I recommend using paper filters, both for convenience and for a cup without sediment. You can also use a finer grind, which yields a richer drink.
4) The charcoal-filtered water took a little getting used to - the coffee was less harsh than when using tap - but better, really. It took a little extra grinds to make the coffee strong enough.
I've been drinking coffee from this machine for a week, and I am very satisfied with it. The most important thing is the taste and it's very good, though not necessarily transcendtal - thus the loss of a star...

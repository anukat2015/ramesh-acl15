Title: My Soldier Loves It!
Content:
I sent this to my son when he was stationed in Afghanistan last winter.  (He is with a medical unit, so they had power in their tent.)  He LOVED it!  Said it was such a luxury to have hot water that quickly, especially when they would come in from missions and were so cold that all they could think of was hot chocolate!  It was such a touch of home that he left it when he rotated back to the U.S. so their replacements could enjoy it.  I'm sending him another one now, to his new duty station in Iraq...those desert nights can get really cold!

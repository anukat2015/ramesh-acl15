Title: Perfect for my home office
Content:
Although heavy and probably larger than a window air conditioner, this unit is worth every penny.  I have a home office with a server and a couple PCs in it and this unit keeps the room as cold as I want it!  I have central air - but my office always seemed stuffy.  Now the entire upstairs loft is as cool and comfortable as the rest of the house.  The unit vents outside - and even with my sliding windows, the venting area is narrow and does not obstruct my view.  It can also be vented directly through the wall, but that seemed a little extreme to me.  It is probably as loud as a window unit and has a fan only mode and a de-humidifier mode.  The temperature is set by degrees, not some dumb low-medium-high setting.  It plugs into a normal household plug and could be moved to another area of the house with little trouble.  I am thinking, if the power went out, this unit could be used with the generator, we would not cook like the last time we lost power in the summer.

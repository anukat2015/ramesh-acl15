Title: Did I Get A Lucky iPod nano?
Content:
My Grandmother got me a white 2GB iPod nano for Christmas and i use it about every chance I get every day. I'm 13 and im only about 5'1" and my iPod nano has dropped out of my top pocket many times and all it has to show is unnoticable scratches. It has also dropped off of my computer desk while charginy many times and still works fine. The iPod nano may freeze up. It has froze on me once and that was the day after Christmas (Dec. 26) and all i had to do was read the little flip out manual that says that u have to hold 'MENU' and the center (white/black-it depends on overall color) button for about 6 seconds and it restarts itself without loosing data.
   I was hoping that the iPod nano could've played video but it only shows pictures(1GB-15,000 pics/2GB-25,000pics/4GB-35,00pics) and full album art.
   Overall the iPod nano is a good buy but if i had the chance to get an iPod video, i would take it.

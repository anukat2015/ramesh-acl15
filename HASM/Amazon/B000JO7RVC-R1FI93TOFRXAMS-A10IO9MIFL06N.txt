Title: It's Good, But...
Content:
I had a 5th Gen iPod that I totally loved but had to replace it after it died. So I went out and got the iPod Classic. Boy do I miss my 5th Gen!
The video on the Classic is very good. I haven't had a problem with any of my movies, TV shows or podcasts yet. The only thing I don't like about the video is that it doesn't sort the music videos by artist and instead just lists them all in alpha order. I found that disappointing.
My two biggest complaints with the Classic is the sound quality and the clickwheel. The clickwheel response is completely slow and I've had it a few times where I had to turn it off and then back on to get it to respond. This gets frustrating very quickly. The audio quality (I've noticed this ONLLY on the music; not on video playback) is much lower than the 5th Gen. The sound isn't as clear and there is a lot of noise. I even bought a new set of headphones and it didn't help. This brings my star rating down quite a bit because it was the first thing I noticed with the Classic.
Overall good points of the Classic:
- The silver brushed metal design doesn't collect as many fingerprints as the white and black versions of the 5Th Gen
- The screen seems to be brighter, which makes the video more crisp
- The battery life is longer than on my 5th Gen
- The clover flow is a nice feature
Bad points:
- BAD audio quality as opposed to 5th Gen, Nano or Shuffle
- The music videos are not sorted by artist which makes the navigation through them annoying
- The clickwheel is HORRIBLE and will cause you great frustration right away
Overall, the 5th Gen is MUCH better. I will keep the classic and just pray that Apple comes up with a firmware update.

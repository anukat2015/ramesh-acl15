Title: I use a lot of hot water
Content:
It has almost become traditional in our family to get me this item, new, for more years than I can remember. It works 24/7 at our house, but at just about 1 year of age, it starts dripping water either around the spout, or actually just dripping. I guess it would be a worn out washer perhaps?
In any case, this years urn didn't make it a year, but fell short by 3 months.
I'm shopping again for another, but can't give 5 stars.. quite.

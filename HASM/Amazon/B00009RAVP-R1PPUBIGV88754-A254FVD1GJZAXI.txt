Title: Doesn't heat very well
Content:
This heater is just a waste of electricity. In order for you to get warm you have to put it right next to you and then make sure you are wearing some sun glasses cause it so damn bright.  I am really disappointed with this unit. Its really hard to heat a 10' x 9' room. There is no point for the oscillating cause also does nothing for you..

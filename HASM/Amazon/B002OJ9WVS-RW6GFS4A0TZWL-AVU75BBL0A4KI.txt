Title: This vacuum = LOVE
Content:
This is far and away the best vacuum I've ever used. After years of buying less expensive uprights and having them fling tiny debris at my feet while vacuuming hard floors, I finally ponied up for this magnificent machine. It's quiet and super-effective. 
We have hardwoods, tile, berber carpet, and a short-pile area rug, and the Polaris does a fantastic job on all of these surfaces. Even gets the cat hair off the carpet -- AND our upholstered sofa and chairs -- with no revolving brush to speak of. 
I will say that getting used to a canister vac is a bit of an adjustment, but well worth it. Having the bag change indicator is great. Haven't changed the bag yet (brand new vac!), but it seems easy enough. The vacuum is light enough to cart all around our 3-level house without feeling like I'm training for some strange vacuum-hauling competition. As for everyone whining about how the cord needs to be longer: oh, please. The darn thing retracts automatically with the push of a foot pedal. I'll take a shorter cord if I never have to wind one by hand again.
All in all, this is a great vacuum, and it works even better than a Dyson, which I think are overrated and overpriced. As for durability, it certainly looks and feels very well-built, and I would assume with a 7-year motor warranty that the thing will last at least that long. If you're on the fence, get one! You won't regret it.

Title: Good idea, pods problematic
Content:
The coffeemaker itself is a good idea and works well.  The Melitta coffee pods produce barely acceptable results, and recent lots have included many defective pods that leak grounds and create a mess when opened.  However, it is possible to use pods designed for other machines if one is very careful to ensure that these are carefuly stuffed into the carrier with NO material overlapping the rim.  This includes the Gevalia pods that have recently become available by mail.

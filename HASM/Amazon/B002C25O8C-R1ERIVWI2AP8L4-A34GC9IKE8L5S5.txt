Title: Acer 5810T8952
Content:
Jus bought 1 Acer 5810T8952 from Amazon.com and found that its quality is not meet my need, it always freeze, stuck, this is simply lousy product that i ever seen. it is not comparable to my old IBM T41.Acer Aspire Timeline AS5810T-8952 15.6-Inch Laptop - 8+ Hours Battery Life
don't buy this Acer 5810T8952, otherwise you will face trouble like me. Amazon is great seller fast delivery but the product itself need to be improved. This note book I sent over to Cambodia and may find the way to get it back to return it to Amazon

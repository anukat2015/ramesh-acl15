Title: No fan only function!
Content:
Second try on getting the info through. Amazon, this is important stuff since it's taken quite a bit of effort to determine the issue, and then try to get the credit from the vendor.
As a heater, the unit seems to work great. But pay attention...there is no "fan only" setting as advertised!!!

Title: Worked well at Bright Angel Campgroung Grand Canyon
Content:
February 2009 I backpacked this thing into the Grand Canyon and it worked very well for us.  We each carried a 1lb propane bottle.  The bottle will last about 2.5 hours on low if I remember correctly.  It does put out a fair amount of heat.  The stand that it comes with is very light and sturdy enough to make it portable.  The stand will make the heater sit facing upwards or 90 degrees perpendicular from the ground. 
It kept two of us plenty warm and I plan on using it on my shorter backpack trips where campfires are not permitted.

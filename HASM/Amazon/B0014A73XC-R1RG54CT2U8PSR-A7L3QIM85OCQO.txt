Title: It was great, big memory, fast, beautiful design. But one day the screen decided to go black and never came back...
Content:
I was really sad because I only had it for over a year...contacted several computer stores but they told me the same thing: I would have to get a new mother board. Called HP, my warranty is no longer good (they only cover for a year, sneaky bastards). Same thing happen to my bf's HP.

Title: My 1st DSLR
Content:
I think I read so many reviews for cameras that I confused myself.  I'm new to SLR cameras, but after reading what was probably a gazillion reviews for Nikons I opted for the D40.  More than one person told me (and I read) that it's a great starter camera.  
I love it and am so glad that I went with it.  I do wish that the lens was a little better on the zoom, but the "kit" lens is usually not the greatest.  It's perfect for what I'm using it for right now.  Once my kids start their Spring sports I'll be shopping for a better zoom lens.
All in all, it was easy to use, has lots of options, is fairly lightweight, and takes great photos.
I'd recommend this camera to others.

Title: Piece of junk
Content:
I've had this vacuum for about a year and a half, and can unequivocally say that it's a hunk of junk.
First, we had the same hose issue that other people mentioned.  It started to rip where it attaches to the canister.  We tried duct-tape patching, which worked for about a month until the hose came clear off the canister.  Not good!
The second major issue is that there is no reset switch.  What this means is that if you vacuum up something that triggers the rug attachment to stop rotating-- string, for instance-- you have to unscrew the machine and manually reattach the belt.  Not good!
Someone else mentioned the difficulty in finding bags to fit it.  We had the same problem with no major retailers carrying them-- Target, Wal Mart, Sears, etc.  We finally had to buy *similar* bags and finagle them into the machine.  Total pain!
The whole unit completely broke on us this past weekend.  A piece of metal came apart inside and my husband said it would take soldering to fix it. 
I wholly recommend you stay as far away from this machine as possible.

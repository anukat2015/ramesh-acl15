Title: Love this.
Content:
Our basement is finished, but does not have enough heating registers.  We had tried a Honeywell down there, but it just couldn't keep it warm enough in the really cold weather.  This DeLonghi works beautifully.  The only problem we had is getting it on the right temperature.  It doesn't have a temperature you can actually set it at (like 72), it must be an internal regulation that you can adjust based on how warm you want it to feel.  But once we got that set correctly it worked well.  Nice and toasty.  The room is approximately 700 square feet and it heats the whole thing.

Title: Amazing Vacuum!  Suction Like No Other!
Content:
I have been searching for a quality canister vac for sometime now.  I did not not want to take out a loan and invest thousands of dollars on the namebrands.  The Amazon.com reviews for the Miele S4210 are 100% accurate and I am glad I trusted what others had to say.  Before I go on, let me preface that I have a home with all hardwood floors.  I cannot speak to the quality of this product on carpeting.  I used the vac for the 1st time last night and found it hard to put down.  It was cleaning so well...excellent suction.  One of the best features I think is how quiet it is.  I have 3 small children and before when I ran the vac they would run out of the room and hide it was so loud.  Last night, they played right around me and I could hear them down the hall.  You will not be disappointed.

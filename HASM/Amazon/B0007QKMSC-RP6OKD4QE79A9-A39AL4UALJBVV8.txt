Title: Canon Digital Rebel XT
Content:
I purchased Canon Digital Rebel XT because of my previous use of a
Canon Rebel 2000.  I particularily liked the idea of being able to use
my existing lenses.  I am extemely pleased with the Digital Rebel XT.
The quickness in being able to take pictures without a delay makes this
camera a real plus for me.  I would recommend this model to anyone 
who loves to photograph especially children, who do not sit still for 
long. This camera is a winner.

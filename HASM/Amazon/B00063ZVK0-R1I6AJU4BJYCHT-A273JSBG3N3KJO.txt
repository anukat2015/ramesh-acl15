Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I cannot recommend this heater to anyone.  I have other Vornado products and have no complaints.  That's why I decided to buy a Vornado brand heater, figuring this would be as good as their other products.  Wrong!  I had a similar problem as one of the other reviewers in that it kept tripping the circuit breaker after a few minutes on the High setting.  I have had other small heaters without having this problem.So I figured I'd try the Low heat setting.  But that actually pumped out cool air!  The Low setting would keep me luke warm only if I kept the heater about one foot from my body.  If I can't keep it on High without shutting off my electricty and the Low setting keeps me cool, what good is this as a heater?

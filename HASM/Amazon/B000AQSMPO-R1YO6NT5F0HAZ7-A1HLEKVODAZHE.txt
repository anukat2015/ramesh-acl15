Title: Work great, coffee is horrible
Content:
The actually coffee maker is nice, and works as intended.  
That said, the coffee is horrible, in fact I don't think I have had a worst tasting coffee ever.  I have tried all the setting and all the different coffee pods, they all taste BAD.  That is saying a lot since I had to drink field coffee while in the army.  I would almost have to say that instant coffee is better tasting.  You are paying a premium price for the single serving capsules, coffee beans from a coffee retailer are almost half the price.  
If you only care for convenience and not for taste then this product is for you, but if you want something that taste like coffee look else where.

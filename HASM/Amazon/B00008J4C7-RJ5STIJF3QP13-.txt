Hey just thought I would help out those with problems returning their vacuum to the Target store... if the product has been kept past 90 days Target will not authorize the return and will advise you to the warranty info... If you do not have the receipt Target's policy does make you exchange it for something of equal or greater value in the same department (vacuums) it does not have to be this particular item though. If you do have the receipt and the product is used Target will return it if it is defective ... other then that Target will not authorize a product that has been simply used and then returned (helps so you do not go and buy someone elses used vacuum). Hope that helped a little.. I'm looking forward to buying this vacuum so thank you for the positive/negetive feedback! *This info comes straight from the source.. I worked there a couple years while in school*

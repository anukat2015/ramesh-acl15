Title: As good as it can get
Content:
Macbook Pros are indeed fascinating, specially if its your first mac. All the small details, the neat reworking of features of other operating systems, the WAY better performance/hardware ratio provided due to software optimizations and less middle-men (software abstraction layers), everything.
The purchase in itself was great: quick shipping, amazing customer service from the seller, product is as described. I just wish I could have bought it with the 512MB of video memory version without having to go all the way up with other hardware specifications, along with an extra $300+ in budget.

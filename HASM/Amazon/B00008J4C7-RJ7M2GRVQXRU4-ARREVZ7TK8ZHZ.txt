Title: perfect tool for the job
Content:
We have a small house with hardwood floors and a few rugs.  My husband has allergies so a hepa filter was a must and we are short on storage so it had to be small/light.  We have owned this for a year and are extremely pleased with it.  We vacume every week with the occasional missed week here or there.    
The price was right.
It has a hepa filter.
It is small/light and very agile
It won't scratch my wood floors with a revolving brush
It doesn't require expensive bags. 
It works wonderfully and picks up plenty (the husband's allergies would let us know if it didn't)
Yes - you have to clean your filter.  The better you clean it, the better it works.  If you are too dang lazy to do this - get something big and cumbersome with more motors.  
I think I would not love it so much if we had lots of carpet.  Nothing traps dirt like carpet and I think you would be cleaning the filter so often that performance would be somewhat degraded.  Probably better to get something more powerful in that case - just my opinion.  However for us - it keeps the house spotless with only some minor maintenance required.

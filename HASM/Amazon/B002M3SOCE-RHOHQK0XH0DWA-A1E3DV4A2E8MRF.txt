Title: It is more of a PDA and web-browser for me
Content:
I am using my IPod Touch for more of its capability of Web-browsing, email, contacts and calendar.  Most of my time is spent in areas with hot-spot (wifi) and I can do almost all of the above pretty much anytime I want.  I jokingly call this unit a poor man's iPhone.  I don't have to subscribe to data plan with my cell phone company.
I am extremely pleased with Safari browser, email, contact and calendar capabilities.  I wish I could easily store MS Office documents on this unit--you can read them as a part of email attachments, but not store them.  My family of four has five iPods and a few other mp3 players and I like my Sansa better for playing/organizing music.  People laugh at me when I tell then that I have no music stored on my iPod Touch, so I am not qualified to comments on its capability as a music player--but, I am sure it is very good. I have downloaded some of the free apps too.  Overall, I am very pleased with the unit.  Maybe, someday I will put some music too on this unit.

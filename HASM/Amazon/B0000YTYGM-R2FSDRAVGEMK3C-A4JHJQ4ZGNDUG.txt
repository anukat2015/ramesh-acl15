Title: Cuisinart DTC-975BKN 12-Cup Coffeemaker
Content:
Best thermal caraffe I've ever used.  Coffee stays hot well into the afternoon when brewed around 6:00 AM.  The unit itself is a little tall and must be pulled out from under the wall cabinet to pour in the water.  Coffee tastes fine, though I haven't made anything other than Folgers yet.  It's also nice that the caraffe holds 12 cups.  There's finally enough coffee for my wife and I in the morning.  The pour spout spatters a little if you're not careful.

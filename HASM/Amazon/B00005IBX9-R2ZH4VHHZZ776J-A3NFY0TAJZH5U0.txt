Title: Cuisinart DCC-1200 - Best Coffeemaker Ever!
Content:
About two months ago it became necessary to replace my coffeemaker as the coffee was no longer hot.  I went to Amazon.com and looked and read reviews.  Based upon the reviews and even though it was a bit more expensive than some, I ordered the Cuisinart DCC-1200.  This coffeemaker makes the best tasting coffee I have ever had at home.  I am using the same freshly ground coffee and it tastes better.  A big plus is the comfortable handle and no-drip feature.  It really does not drip from the pot ever.  My hands and fingers never get burned from steam when holding or pouring from the pot.  Cuisinart has done a great job with this one.  The other manufacturers can learn from this coffeemaker.

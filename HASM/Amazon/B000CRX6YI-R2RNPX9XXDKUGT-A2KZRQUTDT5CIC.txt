Title: An amazing camera worth more than the price!
Content:
So few things in life are worth more than they produce.  Typically, a camera is one of those things.  The Nikon family of cameras however far exceeds the standards.
As a platform, the Nikon D200 camera is one that is hard to beat.  Its a rugged camera that I have had the pleasure of dropping many times, picking up, and continue to shoot (after I replaced the lens immediately).  No other camera that I have ever owned has it been so easy to reproduce the colors that I see, the scenes that I envision, and the feelings that I want emoted.
I can continue with a diatribe of descriptions and technical babel, but as with anything, the best you can do is try it.  Take a class on the camera and you will shoot better than you have ever before.  I love this camera so much that even though the D300 and D700 are out, I will still buy the D200.  Honestly the D200 is all I need.

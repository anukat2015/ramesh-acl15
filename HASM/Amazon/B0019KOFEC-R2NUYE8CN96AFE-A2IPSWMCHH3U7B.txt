Title: Love it
Content:
I am what many of my friends call a gadgaholic.  I keep searching for the perfect gadget.  I have bought so many vacuums I've lost count.  I have laminate flooring throughout my house and 4 dogs and 1 cat.  That adds up to lots of hair.  I keep trying to find a vacuum that will work well for floors.  The Eureka Pet Lover Mighty Mite is "IT".  Finally I've found a vacuum that actually works for me and works well.  It has plenty of suction.  The cord is a good length.  The handle does not fall off when vacuuming.  The only downside is it does not have a retractable cord.  I highly recommend this vacuum.

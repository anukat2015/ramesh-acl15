Title: Don't Waste Your Time
Content:
Don't waste your time and money on this item.  You have to stand right in front of the machine to get any warmth.  Because it does not have an oscillating feature, the warm air does not radiate all around the room. Even in a small area, it only heats the space directly in front of the machine. I have a similar size machine that oscillates and it warms up an entire room.

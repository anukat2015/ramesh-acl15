Title: Caution
Content:
I bought this same heater from another source but simply want to post a warning for others.  The reason I did not give it five stars is the simple fact the plug appartently overheated and melted an area on one  prong and also blackened and slightly melted the prongs area that was in the receptacle.  It turned the heater itself off  but did not trip the breaker box and I smelled the odor of the burnt area upon inspection.  The heater did a beautiful job prior in my TV room as I had the furnce set at 65 and it had not turned on.  The room heated up to 72 degrees.  The back filter is very easy to remove and clean.  My nephew replaced the plug with a very heavy one and also replaced the receptacle. There was no evidence of anything wrong in the connection of wires in the receptacle.   Today, it is 49 degrees outside and my TV room is 72 with the heater now functioning once again.  I have watched the cord and plug very carefully this time for warmth and both have remained cold.

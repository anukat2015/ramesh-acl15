Title: As good as it gets!
Content:
This coffee maker has been churning out great brew for more than a year at the office, even with heavy use, so it was time to pick one up for the house. I was drawn to this model because the carafe always seems to be the weakest link, with glass having a tendency to break and even stainless steel having the propensity to get that burnt coffee taste after a few months. The design of the DCC-2000 gets around these issues and throws in a few extra benefits. The 2000 is unobtrusive and far more aesthetically pleasing than a standard coffee maker. Its coffee dispense pedal makes distribution a snap; however, the space permitted between the base and dispenser makes larger cups a little more of an issue, but achievable. Coffee preparation is just as easy as any carafe design and cleanup is certainly easier. There is also a built in "coffee gauge" (apparently fashioned after a fuel gauge) which indicates how much coffee remains inside, which is more fun to look at than functional, though handy nonetheless. In my experience the DCC-2000 is an attractive, hearty, and all around great coffee maker.

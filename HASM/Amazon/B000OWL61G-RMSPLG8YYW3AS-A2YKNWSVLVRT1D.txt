Title: The Worst Coffee Pot EVER!
Content:
My wife worked at Starbucks and we bought this from her Starbucks store.  It looked nice and we thought Kitchen Aid made good products. 
It is extremely difficult to clean.  On many occassions coffee grounds have clogged it and subsequently coffee doesn't go into the pot and overflows.  This has happened on many occassions, it happened just now and that is why I am writing this review.  I had a Braun coffee maker and never had this problem.
It is somewhat wasteful.  Because the pot is insulated, you have to run warm water through it to heat it up.   
Most importantly, it makes an inconsistent cup of coffee.  We have changed the water filter but it still makes coffee with a funny taste.  It isn't user error, it is the coffee maker.       
Bottom line, don't buy this coffee maker!  You will be extremely disappointed.

Title: Good Computer

I have had the laptop for about a month and am very happy with it.  The only downside is the 15.6 widescreen cuts some normal web pages.  That is not the laptop fault, I should have checked and maybe gone to a 16".  Still the weight and looks of the ASUS is top notch.  Performance is great even on engineering 3D models I some time run.

Title: This vacuum sucks!
Content:
I bought this Bissell Pet Hair Eraser, because I've had a Bissell Butler Revolution for the last 6 years, and I loved it! It was easy to use, light weight, not too loud, it had a conventional bag and a self emptying canister; you could choose which to use...and it was cute! But, after 6 years it 's starting to lose it's suck. I was prepared to love The Pet Hair Eraser...I really hate it. It is LOUD, it is HEAVY, also top-heavy, the cord is ALWAYS in the way,when you empty the container dirt gets everywhere....there's so much static that the inside and top of my trash can gets covered in dust. (My old Bissell made a neat "Hairball" that fell out neatly when you emptied it). When you use the attachment a fine stream of dust gets blown out of the other end, so the outside of the vacuum is covered in fine dirt. Some of the attachments and the dirt canister are clear plastic, so the thing always looks filthy (after the 1st use). Tha attachments are not easy to use...nothing about this vacuum is user friendly. I've had it for a month,and keep going back to use my old tired Bissell,because I dread using this one. I've only used it about 4 times....tryed it again tonight and was SO frustated that I had to jot off this review!!

Title: Very nice heater
Content:
After using this heater for a few weeks, I am very happy with my purchase. I didn't find any bad smell even during the first use. 
Pros:
1. Very quiet. It is much better than the fan heater I used before. You have to pay attention to notice any noise.
2. Very efficient, although the heating up process takes longer than I expected. Once the room is heated up, the room stays to be comfortable.
3. It is very easy to move it to wherever you want.
4. The timer feature is very useful.
5. No dry air anymore. You could leave it on during your sleep without worrying about dry throat the next morning.
Cons: no real problem, I just feel like the design of timer is not very convenient. Maybe I got too used to digital.
Overall, it is a great buy. Wait until Amazon offer free shipping. It is gonna save you quite some money.

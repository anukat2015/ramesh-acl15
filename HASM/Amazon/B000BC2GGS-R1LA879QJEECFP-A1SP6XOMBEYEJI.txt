Title: Honeywell HZ519 Heater
Content:
The Honeywell HZ519 Comfort Heater does a great job!  It is absolutely quiet.  It has easy to operate controls, a warning light in case the heater gets too hot, simple thermostat, and even has a timer.  It is much larger than I expected, but that didn't present a problem.  Consumers Reports also highly recommends this heater, and that's good to know!

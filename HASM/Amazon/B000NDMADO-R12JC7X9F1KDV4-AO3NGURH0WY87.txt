Title: BACK AGAIN TO DYSON
Content:
This is my second Dyson as I purchased a DC07 when they first were out several years ago . I Love the DC21. It is made beautifully and so much easier to haul around than any other machine I tried and I tried out many.  The only thing that I found that was  difficult was that the cord is very short compared to most but since it retracts into the machine that is as long as it could be. It is perfect though as I have a beautiful home with hardwood floors and it is so easy on them and picks up so well as I have two cats, an Australian shepherd and if anyone knows them they shed alot and a little chihuahua and my home is spotless. This machine is fantastic . Dyson did it again.

Title: I love this camera
Content:
I purchased this camera in late Spring but didn't use it until my vacation in July; it's my first dslr. Since then I've begun to use it more and more.  I am taking unbelievable shots and I've not yet begun to scratch the surface of its abilities. Although I have very small hands, I chose the E500 because I prefer a sturdier look and feel and I've not been disappointed. I've got several Olympus cameras which I love: this one puts the others to shame and that is high praise.

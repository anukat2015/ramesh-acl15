Title: A great surprise in a light little package
Content:
A buddy bought one of these a couple months before, and i thought it was just another netbook, but it was a tad larger, light and sleek.
This Gateway is almost as small as an Atom-processor device, tho my hands fit the keyboard better.  I love the hi-def screen.. it allows images to be seen as small & sharp as the printed page.
Win7 is a joy to use, once you've become accustomed to its features and layout. 2Gb RAM & 250GB HDD gives me plenty of room, tho I miss the old keyboard of my Lenovo Thinkpad.   
This stylish keypad is flat & smooth, which makes it easy for my fat fingers to mistype.. I've often had to retype sentences after realizing it's Caps Lock key was on.
Battery lasts for hours and I sometimes forget to take my charger.
My backpack is way lighter with this machine!

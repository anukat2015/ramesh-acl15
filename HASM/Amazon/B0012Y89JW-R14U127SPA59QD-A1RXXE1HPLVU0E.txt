Title: Canon XSi
Content:
This is an excellent camera! It is very intuitive, and has several great features, like the 9 point focus, auto setting custom white balance, 3" LCD (which I originally thought was unnecessary, however turned out to be a very nice thing to have). The camera feels really good in your hands, and provides for quality photos, and quick knowledge of its features. The only bad part is that the body is made of plastic, so if you drop it.... better luck next time. but you can get different armor for it if you are shooting in an area that may be dangerous. Awesome camera!

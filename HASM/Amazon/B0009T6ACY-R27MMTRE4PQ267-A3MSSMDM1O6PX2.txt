Title: Does the Job and can't complain
Content:
Bought the unit a few months ago and no problems.  Shipping box is big and heavy but easy to open via lift-up design. Very easy to install window adapter for exhaust hose and everything else is plug and go. Overall I would buy a second unit when the need arises.

Title: just got it but wow!
Content:
love it! needed a space heater for my office and first tried vornado's EH1-0034-06 AVH2 which cost twice as much, was "okay" at heating/functions and rattled a little from day one and a lot on day 3 when i returned it. this lasko is very quiet, heats well and has good setting interface with a thermostat and two power levels for heater plus an oscillator. (and a remote!) highly recommend value for money

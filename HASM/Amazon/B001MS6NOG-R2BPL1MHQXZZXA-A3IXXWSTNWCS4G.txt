Title: Great laptop!! I always buy Sony.
Content:
I am very happy with my new Sony Vaio (VGN-FW373J/H). The only problem I have been having is some companies haven't bothered to update their drivers. Epson is one example. I have a scanner that works perfectly with Windpws XP, but now I can't use it on the my new laptop because they haven't made a new driver for Vista 64bit. Lame Epson! Very lame! This is not a Microsoft or Sony problem so I am not blaming them in any way. But, I just wanted to make people aware that some companies aren't updating their drivers which means you will have to buy new hardware when you switch to Vista.

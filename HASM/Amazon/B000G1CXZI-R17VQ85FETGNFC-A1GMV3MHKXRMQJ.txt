Title: Everything that I expected
Content:
I needed a small heater that could go near combustible surfaces in a bathroom. So far, this heater has worked flawlessly. People who have complained about this thing being noisy need to get a life. No noise, other than a faint clicking sound when it cools ( you really have to be listening for it), no fans, just pleasant radiant heat. The intuitive,  built in 24 hr timer is a nice plus and saves me from having to buy a stand-alone timer. Nice durable powder coat finish too. 
DeLonghi will no doubt have a liability cow over this, but being able to drape a towel over it for a luxurious warm towel on getting out of the shower makes for a very happy wife.

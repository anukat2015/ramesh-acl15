Title: Pro quality photos in a consumer package
Content:
The D90 offers great photo quality in an easy to use consumer style camera.  The camera accepts our older pro lenses with mechanical auto focus as well as the newer AF-S version lenses.  I can tell a difference in the new CMOS sensor as higher ISO photos are much clearer.  
Highly recommended for someone that wants a smaller DSLR with big camera performance.

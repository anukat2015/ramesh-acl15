Title: Could be cooler but a good unit.
Content:
I had this unit for 2 years now is it works fine even running this unit for 3 days straight without shutting it off. It is very well build compared to a Royal Sovereign 13,500 BTU unit that I also have. Both units pump out cool air, but the only reason this unit did not receive 5 stars is that it can barely keep up with a 400 sq ' room that gets direct sunlight. I would buy again if the price ever drops below $420 delivered..

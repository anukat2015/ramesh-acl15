Title: HP Customer Service is Horrible
Content:
Purchased this laptop At Circuit City for $899 w/ a $50.00 rebate.  It's really sleek looking computer.  The keys stuck for a while, eventually corrected itself. Big problem the fan runs burning hot, sent it back to HP thinking they would repair the problem their notes said that they cleaned it returned the computer w/n six days only to receive it the same day burning hot still after turning the computer on in 30 minutes. The computer is just 90 days old, under warranty.  Why buy a computer from a company that won't even service a potentially fatal problem?  This heat is going to fry the the motherboard, short term life expectancy for this computer, I'd say I blew this purchase and wasted my money don't waste yours.

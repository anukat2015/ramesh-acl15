Title: Overall pleased
Content:
I chose the Bissell over the Hoover after reading the bad reviews of it, especially with the water tanks spilling out if machine if set down. 
I'm loving the Bissell. For hard floors it has a scrub brush and for wood floors it has a soft fabric pad (easily interchangable).
 
It worked well on my kitchen tile floor. It works the best if you take it at a slow speed over the floor. Heat feature was great. It does put the water down in lines though, and the handle has a lot of weight on it compared to regular vacs, but on the plus side it's:
~Easier to use and scrubs about as well as a mop
~Uses much less water
~Dries fairly well - love this feature
~Easy to clean out
~Both water tanks are sealed great - dirty water doesn't mix with clean 
~Vacuums pretty well (not a sub for a full size vac, but worked well enough for me to prep for wet cleaning)
There's pros and cons to this vs. a mop.  If you're looking for an incredible cleaning machine that does it all perfectly - it doesn't exist (in this price range at least).  But I wasn't looking for that, I just wanted something easy, that does a good job and is a decent price, especially with kids and their everyday messes.

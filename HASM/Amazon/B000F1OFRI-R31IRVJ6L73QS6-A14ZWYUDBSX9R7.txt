Title: Love it!
Content:
This cubeis great. My husband's iPod is no match for this mighty mouse. LOL Sound quality is great, love the FM feature. Not as huge as iPod, but 2G is plenty for going to the gym or just lounging around. I can change out my playlists in a few seconds. I throw it on the charger at night with my cell phone. When I plug the mini speakers in, sounds just like a full size stereo.

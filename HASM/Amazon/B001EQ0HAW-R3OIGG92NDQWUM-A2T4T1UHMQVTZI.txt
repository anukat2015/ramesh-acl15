Title: Want to love it.. full of problems
Content:
I love the concept of the Zune, wireless sync, sharing music, so forth. My problem, is as much as I've wanted to love this thing, I've had nothing with problems with every Zune I've purchased. This Christmas I purchased a 120 and 16 gig for gifts and for myself. 
The 120's battery would not hold a charge out of the box. Back to the store to exchange it. Second one seems to work. My 30 gig had the same issue and was repaired by microsoft, twice. 
the 16 gig, was dead out of the box. Wouldn't sync, turn on, etc. Returned it for exchange. The next one worked for a few days, then the backligth stopped working. Result.. it died too. I'm on my third and last.. we'll see how this one works.

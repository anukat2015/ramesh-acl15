Title: Bad Execution and battery life
Content:
I ordered 1 from amazon and I am waiting for about 60 days and they expect to ship it in October of 04. Bought 2 ugly blue ones at another online site and I am having a nightmare with it. It skips like crazy when working out and even after a full days charge dies in battery time after 2hrs of use. The color shading is also strange , it differs from top to bottom. Also the quality of the sound seems poor with the default headphones. I purchased some fontopia ones and it seems clearer. The second mini which was a present was DOA, and calling apple did not help as they want to replace it with a refurb.

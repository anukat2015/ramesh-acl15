Title: Okay, but not great.
Content:
Purchased this product from Home Depot in January of 2006 and used it to heat a very small room, which it did well enough. This year after using it for about a month on and off, the heater would shut down after running for a short time. I cleaned the vents located in the back of the unit and it now appears to be working okay. 
The power cord does appear to heat up to an alarming temperature.
Nice featuers: Oscilating movement, timer and remote.
Bad: Power cord heats up to where it is nearly melting. It will shut down if rear vents get clogged. And it does't do a good job of heating up a larger room. I wouldn't use it for a room larger than a 10' by 12' bedroom with 7' ceilings.

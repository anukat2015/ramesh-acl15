Title: great performance and great price for an ultraportable
Content:
this laptop disguises itself as a netbook in terms of size. in terms of performance this will smoke any netbook out there anytime anywhere.
the actual performance is a bit underwhelming, but that's ok since this is an ultra portable notebook. powered by a core solo microprocessor and in conjunction of intel's gma 4500hd graphics this machine can handle vista home premium quite easily (but i cannot wait for windows 7). dvd playback is superb and the laptop comes bundled with power dvd. all you need is an external drive and some movies =).
if you need an affordable notebook then get this one. if you can wait a bit longer then get the sucessor of this model (the dual-core version). you won't go wrong.
kudos for acer for bring gadgets like these to the market.

Title: Hamilton Beach Beverage Center
Content:
I have had this unit now for 3 months it brews an excellent single cup of coffee, better than a Keruig or Senseo both of which I also own.
The design is a bit quirky but not a problem. The water goes in the front in a draw like device and that has to be closed firmly.  I mention that because if you don't do that the coffee maker will appear to be defective and sputter. I made that mistake only to be embarrassed by customer service when I realized it a user problem and the maker (dumb me).  I give this high marks for making coffee using grinds, less so when using the Pod adapter that is included.  
Bottom line is this is a worth while purchase and as noted it brews a better cup of coffee than the Keruig or pod maker, again both of which I own.

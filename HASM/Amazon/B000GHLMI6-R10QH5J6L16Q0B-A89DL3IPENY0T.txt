Title: Improvement on a great predecessor.
Content:
We owned the predecessor to this coffee maker, the Hamilton Beach Model 47454. We purchased it in December of 2006 and have literally used it every day, sometimes 2 or 3 times in a day. That's over 1400 uses. We paid about $77 and calculate the average cost per use amounts to about 4 cents! The 47454 still works well and we are keeping it in storage as a backup. 
Regarding the 47665 - we were greatly pleased to see that all the features that made the predecessor so good were not tampered with. It is still intuitive and can be set up and used without referring to the manual. The clock has large numbers on a lighted blue display, important when you are squinting at it through sleepy eyes in the morning. It is simple to set the clock and use the auto brew function - a small green light tells you you have successfully set it to activate. It still keeps coffee hot and fresh without scorching for 2 hours. The usual caveats still apply i.e., make sure the pot is seated securely on the base and that no coffee grounds get in the coffee dispensing receptacle. 
Now here's the best part. The only thing we found a tad off about the HB47454 was the fact that the coffee holding carafe was difficult to clean. Because of the cramped space it wasn't easy to get your hand inside to scrub it out with every month or so. We would curse and bark our knuckles every time. But it was a small inconvenience given the performance of the coffee pot. The model 47665 has redesigned the carafe and made it much wider. It is now a snap to get in and clean it. This is the only issue I would have suggested improvement on and voila, it has been addressed. Also, we paid about $20 less for this model than its replacement model.What's not to like?

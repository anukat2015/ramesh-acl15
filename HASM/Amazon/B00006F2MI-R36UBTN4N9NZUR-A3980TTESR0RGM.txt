Title: Great coffee with a great mess to clean up!
Content:
The coffee produced by this product is outstanding, and it actually keeps it warm most of the day (>6 hours).  The down-side is that the unit is cumbersome to clean up, and really needs a lot of care every time you use it.  If you appreciate the quality it provides, it is well worth it.  If you could handle a step below premium in exchange for convenience, consider something else.

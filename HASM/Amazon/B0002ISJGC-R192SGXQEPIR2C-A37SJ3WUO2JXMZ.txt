Title: Decent machine for the price...
Content:
... I just wish someone made a coffemaker at a decent price that lasted more than a year (I'm ordering #3, anybody need a replacement carafe?).  A few points: the spout is not dripless, open the lid slowly so the condensation doesn't run down the back of the machine, and if the coffee grounds splash over and fall to the bottom of the filter holder the clogged 'pause-n-serve' runs all over.

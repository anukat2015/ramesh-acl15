Title: Nice heater and room ionizer for the money.
Content:
This is a great heater, fan, and room ionizer for the money. My only complaint about it is that it made clicking noises as if it was trying to oscillate but was not able to rotate. However, those problems went away for some unknown reason. I've used it for only two weeks so I don't know how it would be for long extended periods of time.

Title: quick heat for small spaces
Content:
Because of a warm winter, I haven't used this heater as often as I expected.  But so far, it has been a great little unit for a good price.  I've set the unit to kick on at a minimum temperature to keep the edge off the cold in a seldom used room; when I need to use the room for a while, it's easy to kick up the heat level and be comfortable in just a couple of minutes, and I don't have to spend a lot of money keeping the room warm day & night.  If it's still working in 2010, its rating  will go up to five stars in my book. Happy happy.

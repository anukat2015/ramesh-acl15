Content:
i bought this because it has the multi-language feature which supports korean, japanese, and chinese language. and it's really helpful, only that it seemed like it doesn't support the id3 tags, so it only displays the file name which is a little bit annoying. also the shuffle options doesn't really work. but other than those, it's an awesome purchase

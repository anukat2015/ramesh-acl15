Title: I love IPods :)
Content:
I never thought I'd need an IPod, but I got one because I can get an addaptor for my car tape player and it's easier to put stuff on an IPod then on a tape.  But now that I have one (and the IDog) I'm listening to music alot more and it's so great.  I also have some books on cds that I've put on it, and it's alot easier carring around the IPod nano then 3 cds per book.  And I love the fact that I could get a pink one, it makes it very distincivly mine (because most of my friends wouldn't be caught dead with something pink)

Title: All is great except...
Content:
The thermostat works great. The only beef I have with it is that the batteries fall out relatively easily. There isn't a guard that keeps them in, only a couple of 'teeth' on one and the pressure of the spring holding the other. It's a pain when you spend 10 minutes programing it, the batteries pop out and then you have to reprogram the entire thing over again. 
As a thermostat it works as advertised, just a design issue.

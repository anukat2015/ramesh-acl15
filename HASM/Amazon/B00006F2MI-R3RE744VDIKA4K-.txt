Title: Best coffee made at home!
Content:
I love this coffee maker.  It is so nice to wake up to freshly made coffee from freshly ground beans. It has more parts and pieces to clean because the coffee grinder is attached but it is well worth the price and time involved.  It makes a very good cup of coffee everytime, depending on the beans of course!  I recommend it.

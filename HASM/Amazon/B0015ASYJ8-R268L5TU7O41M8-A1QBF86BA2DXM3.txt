Title: My first SLR
Content:
It's my first SLR, and I couldn't be happier with it. I hesitated for a long time because I was worried that I wouldn't take the camera everywhere the way I did with my point and shoot. But it's small, light and just as easy to tote everyplace. The lenses are also much smaller and lighter, but with the same quality shots. And it takes simply beautiful pictures. The price wasn't so high that I had to hock my first born for it either, which was the other barrier holding me back.

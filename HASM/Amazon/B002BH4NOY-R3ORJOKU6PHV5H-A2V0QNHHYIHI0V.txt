Title: Runs Hot!
Content:
Bought this laptop for my daughter who is starting college.  She likes the computer except that it runs so hot that you can't set it on your lap.  Who wants a laptop that you can't comfortably put in your lap.  Other than the heat issue it's a great laptop.  Light weight and very portable.

Title: This vacuum really sucks - in the best possible way!
Content:
I'm 2,000 miles away from my cyclonic upright, and I needed a good vacuum without spending a lot of money. This little gem fills the bill. It's lightweight - surprisingly so - but don't let that fool you; most of the cost must have gone into developing the powerful motor.
I took this to a rug that hadn't been vacuumed since Mme. Curie discovered radium, and despite the fact that the carpet tool does not have a power beater, the results were most satisfactory. It came with the floor and rug tool, an upholstery attachment, and a cute little thing that doubles as crevice tool and dust brush. I wish it had a separate dust brush attachment, but that's just about my only unfulfilled desire.
For the $60.00 I paid, I got a neat little canister vac that will serve me well, hopefully for years to come.

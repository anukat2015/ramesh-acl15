Title: Update: Toshiba has offered an update so you can run Virtual PC
Content:
THE FOLLOWING REVIEW IS FOR THE INTEL MODEL NOT THE AMD MODEL OF THIS COMPUTER:
UPDATE MARCH 25:  TOSHIBA HAS OFFERED AN UPDATE WHICH WILL ALLOW VIRTUAL PC TO RUN ON THIS COMPUTER. IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME AS I GAVE THIS COMPUTER TO MY DAUGHTER AND PURCHASED A USED LENOVO COMPUTER LAPTOP FROM AMAZON.
We bought this laptop so I could run my beloved Mastercook program to help me do grocery shopping. I also use this computer to run my Wild Ginger sewing pattern software.
I do like how easy it is to find files and other programs using Windows 7. As much as I loved Windows XP, the search function and ease of locating files, is so much better on Windows 7.
The mouse pad on this computer is a bit fast. I did manage to configure it to the slowest speed possible but it's still mighty fast.
The computer is light in weight, uses the battery efficiently, the display is easy to read, and the computer seems to run cooler than my old HP laptop.
Recommend.

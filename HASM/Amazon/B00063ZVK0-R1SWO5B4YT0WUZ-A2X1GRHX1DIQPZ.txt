Title: Heater does not get HOT!
Content:
Advantages of Vornado.
1.  Compact, one piece.
2.  Outside case is always cool to the touch.
3.  Automatic shut off in the event the unit tips over.
Disadvantages:
1.  Unit does not put out much heat.
2.  Unit is preset from factory to a temp. below 100 degrees.
Do not concern yourself about a fire in this unit as it does not conduct enough heat to start a fire.  I purchased two units, and I had to return both of them.

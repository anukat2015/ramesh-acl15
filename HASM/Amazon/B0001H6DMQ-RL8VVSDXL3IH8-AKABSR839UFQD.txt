Title: Heavy weight, Super sucking machine.
Content:
It sure sucks everything up including carpet itself.  I'm concerned that my carpet will be paper thin in few years.  Long cord is good, but both body and wind tunnel part are so heavy to carry around the house and it is not made for wood floor at all.  I don't think it's worth the money and I don't recommend anyone to buy it.

Title: Great Heating source
Content:
I just got this for my home and the warmth is a GREAT improvement! The price for fuel is 30 to 35$ for a 5 Gal. container. But compared to the cost of electric baseboard heating, I am happy. My wife bought an additive for the fuel to give a vanilla scent which takes away the kerosene scent which is not that bad either.

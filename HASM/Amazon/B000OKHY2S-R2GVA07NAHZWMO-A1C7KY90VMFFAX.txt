Title: Works the way it should
Content:
This is not an air conditioner and if one thinks
that they are going to have an A/C comfort zone level
with this Evaporative Air Cooler then please think again.
I am using the cooler in a all open living/dinning/kitchen(galley)
room which has vaulted ceiling and ceiling fans.
It has worked very well,so much so it has lowered the temp by 4 degrees and keeps the A/C from recycling on and off.
The cooler is made very well and does push out effective cool air(not cold as an A/C would).
When adding ice you can feel the temp difference in the air flow.
This being an  Evaporative Air Cooler, it does do, what it is suppose to do.Nice product and Inox Outlet shipped, handled the ordered in a great manner

Title: Awesome, Fun, Easy Delicious Coffee!
Content:
I attended a conference at the Lowes Bay Coronado (CA) and their in-room coffee makers were Keurigs with a nice selection of k-cups: Emeril Bold, Decaf, Green Tea, Celestial Seasons, etc.
I could hardly wait to get home and order one for myself!  It came with a variety pack of k-cups and brew size options ranging from a 5 1/4-ounce to 7 1/4-ounce and 9 1/4-ounce all the way up to 11 1/4-ounce which is what I most often use with Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold.  I use cream and sugar, so this makes the perfect size and strength mug of coffee for me!
One of sample cups included was a Gloria Jean Hazelnut which I made for a friends in an 8 ounce mug (leaving room for cream) and she said it was one of the best cups of coffee she ever had.
Recently I have seen k-cups available for sale at Henry's Farmer's Market in Rancho Bernado (San Diego area) and I recently saw a nice selection of k-cups at Bed Bath and Beyond.
I only drink 1 large mug of coffee a day, but have tea and sometimes cocoa in cold weather so I leave my machine on all the time -- this way a mug of fresh, hot delicious coffee takes 34 seconds to make each morning and is instantly ready to brew another cup or mug if we have guests.  I keep the Keurig in my bedroom and am thrilled with my purchase and recommend it to any coffee lovers out there! 
I have pretty much given up my Starbucks habit because this is so quick and delicious!

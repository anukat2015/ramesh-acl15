Title: Olympus Does It Again
Content:
Another fine product made by Olympus. I believe in the SLR category, the Evolt e-510 has to be right on top for the price range. Dusy removal and image stabalizer (to name only a couple) are just some of the benefits and plusses that this camera has. I believe anyone moving up to the SLR or upgrading thier camera, can't overlook the quality and options of this camera. A very good "first" SLR camera and it is built tough. The one thing I will mention, is the plastic part of the lens when it attches to the camera. I would a lot rather of seen some sort of metal there but it is the only thing I found that I thought wasn't exactly what I would prefer. The options for accessories is just about unlimited and where the camera is larger than most digital cameras, it is very easy to get a hold of and yet still very nice for tripod shots as well. For some the size may be a bit much for those who like small compacts, but if your looking to get serious about taking pictures, be sure to include this camera as an option!

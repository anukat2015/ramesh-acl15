Title: GREAT MACHINE!  LASTED OVER 1 YEAR
Content:
My machine quit working this afternoon.  It is definitely time for a replacement.
I used the ECM250 machine 2-3 times per day, for roughly 5 days each week, during a period of over 1 year.
Mr. Coffee makes a great product.  Mr. Coffee recently sent me a FREE
replacement Tamper/Spoon- WITHOUT ASKING, after sending them a question VIA EMAIL about the proper tamper to use with my machine.   
I buy my whole beans in large bulk packages at Costco, then grind them with a Krups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Black.  
I save a small fortune every year, by brewing my own espresso.  
This way, I can readily justify a $6 per week habit on 1 local and 2 national lottery tickets.
I intend to buy a new Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine from Amazon.com, later this evening!

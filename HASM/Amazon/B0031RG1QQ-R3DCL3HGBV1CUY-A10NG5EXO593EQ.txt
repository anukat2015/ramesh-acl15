Title: I absolutly love my computer
Content:
I bought the NV59 series about 3 months ago, and I absolutly love it. The best feature, in my opinion, is the BluRay Drive, and the HD resolution. When I viewed my first BluRay disc I could see the pimples on peoples faces, thats how clear it is. The only thing that I have had trouble with is the mouse pad, it kinda has a mind of its own now and then, its kinda hard to describe so I will show you what happens..... I hopeweather is nice the.... It kinda skips now and then, it gets frustrating especially when you notice it after you typed everything you need too and then have to retype. I just use the button that "freezes" the mouse pad, and use a regular mouse. Other then that this computer is a gem, its fast, and there is plenty of room. More then enough room. It is good for a gamer or just to use as a business computer. The battery life is kinda low, but thats never a problem for me as I keep this plugged in most of the time. I think the life is just over 4 hours. That can be fixed by buying a battery that lasts longer or changing your battery settings. Among the many other things I love about this computer, I especially like that its lite, easy to carry around and doesnt weigh you down.... With that said, to sum it all up I absolutly love this computer and wouldnt trade it for anything!!!!

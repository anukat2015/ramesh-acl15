Title: Unhappy Husband
Content:
This Sony MP3 player was purchased for my husband - it is the worst!!!!.  I purchased a Sony MP3 player for myself shortly before buying this for him and I have had no problems.  His is absolutely useless!!!  It constantly gets stuck in a certain mode and you can't do a thing with it -  you just have to leave it be for a few days and then it starts to work again. The thing had completely died - I've owned a sony phone and it was the absolute worst.  I said I would never buy anything Sony again, wrong - I purchased a digital camera (of course you can only use Sony brand memory sticks - not good) and it also turned out to be a bunch of garbage - it died just like every other Sony item I bought.  My Sony MP3 was being discontinued therefore I bought it dirt cheap and it's been working okay I guess - then again, I've only used it about 10 times.   Not a Sony fan.  This is truly the last Sony item I'll buy.

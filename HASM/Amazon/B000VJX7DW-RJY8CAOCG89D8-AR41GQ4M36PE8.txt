Title: Best D300 review Ever!
Content:
A great camera.  I stepped up from a D200, and I find the improvements excellent.  The large screen and self cleaning features are my 2 favorite improvements.  There is little difference between the 10 and 12 MP, but the camera seems to handle noise better and everything works a little more quickly.  I am a semi-pro, and this camera will pay for itself quickly.

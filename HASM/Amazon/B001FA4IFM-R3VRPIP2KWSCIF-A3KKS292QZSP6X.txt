Title: Holmes Space Heater
Content:
We ordered a Holmes space heater because of the unusually cold winter in Florida. The device operates quietly as advertized. It has a single button temperature setting scheme where you tap on the same button to cycle through the settings. Temperature increments are in 5 deg. Farhenheit steps which was adequate for our needs. The device easily keeps a 13 x 15 room warm when set to 70deg. and the doors are shut to keep the heat in.
Overall, for $50 we are very satisfied with the product. I think the product has a 3 year warranty (buyer please verifybefore purchase!). Let's see if it operates as quietly over time as it does when new.

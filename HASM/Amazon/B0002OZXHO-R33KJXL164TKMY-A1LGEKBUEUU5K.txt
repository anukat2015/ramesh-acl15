Title: Best Purchace Of My Life
Content:
This has to be the best thing to happen to music players ever. I love everything about this. The design is dare I say.... sexy. It is so light holds a ton of songs and wraps it all up in a nice little package. iTunes is so easy to use its unbelievable. It works great on windows. But be cautioned you need a case for this thing. It scratches very easily. Battery life is also great(12 hours). The click wheel is so easy to use a retarded mutant baby could navigate with ease. It has some cool games and you can configure it to trasport other files. All in all this is the best f*** Creative and Rio. Get the best get this iPod.

Title: BIG BUDDY IS MY BUDDY
Content:
I bought this heater a month ago to heat my garage 20x32 just over 600 sq ft well insulated. So far i have gone through about two 20# cylnders running the heat at least every night for 2-3 hours and on weekends 6-7 hours a day. The temp in the garage has never dropped below 35 deg, and from there it warms up to 50-55 degrees in about an hour running on high makes it warm enough to work. I have an ac adapter from radio shack pretty inexpensive less than $10. 
All in all i would highly recommend the Big Buddy heater it works great with throw aways although you throw away more than empty cylnders compared to a 20# cylnder. I last bought a 40# cylnder, if that gets me through a month that is reasonable enough to get through the winter.

Title: It will break - trust me.
Content:
I bought this player in June and within a month it began to distintegrate: horrible distortion in sound, screen slowly began to blank out completely, etc. It became unplayable. I contacted Creative and was told to try the firmware download that supposedly corrects this exact problem, which means that many, many units must have done the same thing. I was unable to get the download to work, so Creative informed me that for $25 I could send the unit back for repair. This is a third of the price of purchase!  I will not be buying another Creative product - terrible customer service. I own another micro Creative mp3 player that also broke down, although it took it a year to do so. I am very disappointed with both the product and the customer service.

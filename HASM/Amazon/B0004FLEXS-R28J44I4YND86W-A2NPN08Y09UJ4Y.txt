Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
So many reviews........  I bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and have not had any problems with it.  Makes excellent coffee, does not drip, no rusting anywhere, clock works perfect.  I am a coffee drinker that was tired of getting "tinny" after tasting coffee until I bought this Black and Decker.  Cleaning the carafe was a little difficult, water would not completely empty after rinsing, therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I am buying one for my daughter for Christmas.

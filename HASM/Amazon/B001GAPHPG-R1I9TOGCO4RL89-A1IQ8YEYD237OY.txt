Title: Great camera
Content:
I bought both the Pentax K2000 and the Nikon D60 to do a true "side-by-side" comparison and after a couple of days taking  a bunch of different pictures with both, I determined that the pictures were a little crisper with the Pentax.  I used the exact settings on both cameras and took pictures of the same thing at the same distance and if you look at the final product closely, you will probably come to the same conclusion I did.  Don't get me wrong, the Nikon took really good pictures.  If I would have not bought the Pentax and just bought the Nikon, I would say the Nikon takes fantastic pictures, but when you compare the two side-by-side the Pentax takes a little better picture.  The Nikon went back to the store and I'm now a proud owner of the K2000.

Title: Easy to use
Content:
I am 60 something and find most of the current cell phones and even the IPODs a bit difficult to use with my large and shakey fingers.  But the IPOD touch is intuitive and a delight to use. Wi Fi is very fast and very convienent to do quick checks on internet. Another intuitive, easy to use and understand device from Apple. I got the 8G version, but wish now that I had gotten more memory. Be aware that if you don't turn off the device with the slider, the device will still be in wi fi mode which will drain the battery even if you shut the device off with the button.

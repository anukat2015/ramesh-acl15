Title: Never another HP product
Content:
I purchased two Compaq laptops for Christmas 2008.  Four months into using my laptop, the screen spontaneously cracked.  I hardly took it anywhere and when I did I used a heavy duty carry case.  HP/Compaq took it into consideration for repair, at my expense.  $429 to replace the screen, I opted out.  The second pc has a glitch where the screen has to be repositioned every 30 minutes or so when it goes all white.
After fighting HP on the first pc I have no will to do so on the second.  They don't live up to the "Built to Last" sticker on the keyboard.  HP does not live up to their warranty.  My 16 family members have agreed to never by HP/Compaq products ever again.

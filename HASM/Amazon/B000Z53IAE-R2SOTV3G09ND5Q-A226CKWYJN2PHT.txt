Title: Portable AC
Content:
I will get right to the point. This product is indeed portable and it does blow out cool air, but as you can see just by looking at the picture it has a huge heat exhaust. Its about 13 inches and the tube that the cool air is blown from is only 4 inches wide. This thing blows more heat than it does cool air and you must be sitting right in front of the tube. It will not cool an entire room. Not even a closet. You will have to improvise for the best setup. I was warned but I had to see for my self. I was better off getting a AC with a window kit for the exhaust.

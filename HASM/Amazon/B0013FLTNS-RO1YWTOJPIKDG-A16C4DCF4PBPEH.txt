Title: One Year Old and Going STRONG
Content:
I purchased a MacBook Pro (MBP) last year and haven't regretted one minute of it. When I replace this one I will probably go with the 15" model since the 17" has been a bit big to be hauling around all the time (my notebook and Nikon are always with me).
I've been using mine for Java Programming, Project Management, Photography, Web Site Development, Games and of course other graphics creation for miscellaneous projects. It occasionally runs a little bit hot but I expect it when I'm running Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Parallels with Windows XP running Projects and cruising the web all at the same time.
One of the first things I did (and do) when I get a Mac is REMOVE iTunes (Floola instead), iCal and iChat (Adium instead). I install VLC, Adobe Reader, NeoOffice, Firefox, Eclipse, HandBrake, iSquint, iAlertU, OoVoo, smcFanControl, Transmission, The GIMP, MacPorts, Fink and the Developer tools available on the OS X installation DVD. I also install a plethora of Adobe stuff (Photoshop, Flash, Dreamweaver, Illustrator & Lightroom).
I can't say a bad thing about my MBP. I also purchased the chicklets (metal) keyboard and mighty mouse. I have my own home workstations, but it is very common for me to ignore them in favor of using this MBP. I can't wait to see what next year's models are going to be like, that is when I plan on replacing this one with a shinny new one.

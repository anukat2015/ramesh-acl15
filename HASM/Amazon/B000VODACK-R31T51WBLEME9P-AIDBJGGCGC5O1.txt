Title: Very Good Player
Content:
I purchased this about 6 months ago and use it daily to listen to audio books. The battery life is very good. I drive about 40 minutes each way, and only have to recharge it every two weeks or so. It also resumes in the place I left off. The glossy surface is very tough. I have not been particularly careful with it and there are still no scratches on the surface. I wish that it had more memory or an expansion slot, but it is good enough for what I do with it. One thing that I don't like is that the touch screen buttons are too sensitive and you must lock them with  the switch at the top or you will accidentally activate a function you don't want to. There is not a clear separation between them either. It should be fine if you have small fingers. I have pushed the wrong button a few time because this. I paid around $[...] for this when I bought it and have been very happy with how it works. I also like the very small size

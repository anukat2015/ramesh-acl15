Title: Best little heater I've ever had
Content:
I've had this little heater for a few months now and it's the best one that I have ever had. I use it in my "Computer room" that is the little bedroom at the tail end of my 14x70 trailer. Up here in the Colorado Rocky Mountains it gets pretty cold in the winter. So to save on heat at night I close off the back room. In the morning it can be very cold in here! This little heater will get this room nice and warm in just a few minutes. The temperature settings on the top of it are off a little, but for what it is and what its used for its close enough. On the high setting its a little loud but not bad. On the low setting it puts out a lot of heat and is quiet enough to hardly be noticed. 
  So far I'm very happy with it. The only thing now is to see how long it will last. I would recommend it to any one that needs a small portable heater that doesnt need an exact temperature control. It has been good for a room thats 12'x12' and below zero outside, and should be good for one a little bigger.

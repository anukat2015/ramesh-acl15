Title: This vacuum has been a disappointment
Content:
A few months after purchasing this vacuum the EL6989 (Eureka EL6989A Electrolux Oxygen Ultra Canister Vacuum Cleanerthe power head worked only when pushed forward.  When pulled backwards it stopped.   I have replaced the hose, the pedal release (twice), and both electric wands and it still doesn't work.  it has  not been used hard and for the reputation and premium price, it is a hugh disappointment.  i do not recommend this vacuum.[

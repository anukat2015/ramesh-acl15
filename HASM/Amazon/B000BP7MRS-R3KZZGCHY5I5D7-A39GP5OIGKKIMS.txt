Title: filter door flips open - causes mess
Content:
I got this Braun as a replacement for my 10 year old Braun.  
2 complaints- 
1) I've noticed a plastic taste with several coffee makers..I'll live with the Braun for 2 weeks and see if it dissipates...if not it goes back.  Krups was by far worse in the plastic taste department, so at least Braun it might be OK with some time.
2) The spring loaded filter door latch doesn't firmly hold the filter in the closed position.  It pops open and water drips everywhere, since the coffee filter is in the "out" position.  I initially used scotch tape to hold the filter door closed.  Then I partly disassembled the top and removed the torsion spring.  Now the door stays closed.  The button to release the door is not needed anyway.  For years I just pulled the filter door in or out, and never thought anything fancier gizmo was needed.
I'd have been happier if Braun spent money on better plastic materials with less outgassing...I don't like drinking plastic-flavored coffee.

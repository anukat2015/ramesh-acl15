Title: Works great! Fairly economical too.
Content:
I've had this heater for about a week. Local temps have been between mid 30's to 50 and this little heater handled it perfectly. I'm using it to heat my office, about 220 sqf. Set on the low setting and on the #3 thermostat control it keeps my office between 65 and 75. I plugged it into my P3 Killawatt and it told me that it would cost me around $50 to run it like this, full time, per month.
Pros:
Compact design, lots of options.
Puts out a lot of heat on the high setting.
Silent!
Cons:
Smelled bad for the first few hours of use..not a big deal.
A digital thermostat would be nice, but the thermostat worked well. You will need a thermometer in the room to get it where you want it.
All in all a very nice heater for the money.
I purchased this from Amazon.com and the service was excellent. I paid a little extra for faster delivery and it showed up when promised.

Title: nice heater
Content:
I saw a favorable review on another web site about this heater giving out gentle heat and having worked well for 3 years so I purchased it even though the price was so low that I thought it might be to good to be true.  It is very good and it has all kinds of controls to help it meet your needs.  The heat output is good, will keep a fair sized bedroom warm and we like the gentle oscillation and timer that allows you to have it shut off when you want it to.  For the money it is a very good buy.

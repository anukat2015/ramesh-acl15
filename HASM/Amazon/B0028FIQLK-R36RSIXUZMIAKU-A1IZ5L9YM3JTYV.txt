Title: Great gamming laptop for the price
Content:
This is the second Asus notebook I have owned, both gamming. Overall I will have to say Impressive laptop for the price per performace. IT far out performes other laptops in its price range. The G50 lays down some serous gamming numbers for a laptop. its a perfet size and weight. Product qty overal is incredible for the price. Not much else i can say but got a free laptop backpack with purchase nice qty also.  Asus backs there products periode! I tell you this becuse this is the second asus i have owned they pay shiping to get it to them and back and fix problems very fast. I ussaly have it back withen 5 days or less. I shouldent have to buy an extended warrentys for somthing that should work. so I buy asus they back there products at no extra charge for 2 years and at a great value for you money periode. buy the time the warrenty up technology changed so much its about time to buy a new laptop anyways. Hope this helps.

Title: Great Cup of Coffee!!!
Content:
I had used a peculator coffee pot for years and was sad when it would no longer work.  I tried a couple other peculators and didn't like the results.  I then moved to drip and because we have a great local coffee roaster [...] wanted to grind my own coffee.  I purchased a Capresso coffee maker and Capresso grinder.  I was very satisfied with the burr grinder but had several problems with the coffee maker so decided to replace it with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.  I have had good luck with other Cuisinart products and this was no exception!  It is very easy to use.  The first think I did was test the temperature of the water used for brewing and it was perfect.  With the Dcc-1200 and fresh ground coffee, I am now enjoying great coffee again.  This is the first new product I have purchased in a long time that I can truly say I have found no negative aspects.  A good investment.

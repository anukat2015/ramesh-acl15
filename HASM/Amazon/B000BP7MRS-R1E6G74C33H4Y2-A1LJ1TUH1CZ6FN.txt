Title: Leaks!
Content:
We have owned this coffee maker for less than a year and it has started leaking coffee all over the counter every 3rd time we brew coffee. We can't quite tell where it is leaking from and why it doesn't do it consistently. Each time we cross our fingers and hope for the best. This has been so frustrating! We have run the filter and the cone piece in the dishwasher and maybe this has caused the problem?? We brew coffee twice/day usually and have been more disappointed with this machine than any we have owned.

Title: Everything was OK BUT after 2 days of use noticed cant connect to wi fi due a hardware issue
Content:
Its just a beautiful laptop but iam very dissapointed of it because came with a hardware or system defect and sony service couldnt help to solve it so i had to return it. The problem consist that every time i tryed to connect to wifi windows said it couldnt and just after that present a blue screen with IRQL LESS OR EQUAL ERROR and reboot my pc. I tryed hard to find a cause with sony custumer care and technical service but nothing worked. :(
Hope to be more lucky next time..

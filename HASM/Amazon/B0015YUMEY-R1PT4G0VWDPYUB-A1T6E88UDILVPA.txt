Title: Best laptop in the market. Finally a trouble free  machine that i like to use it everyday.
Content:
I bought this laptop on the 2nd day after it release.  I am happy user until now although it cost more than other PC laptop. But there are many advantages that makes Macbook Pro be the top machine today.
Pro: 
Fast Speed - I am a photoshop user. This machine runs very fast. Almost as good as the mac pro. I run WindowXP and OS X at the same time, very smooth. Some people complaint heat of the old MBP, I haven't experience heat problem at all.  I believe Apple fix the problem in this new MBP. 
Beautiful screen - I have the Matte screen, very bright, nice color. Very good view angle. 
Operating System
OS X - very stable and user friendly. Can't wait for the Leopard release.
Battery life 
last upto 5-6 hours depends on how you used it. For movies, expect 3 -4 hours.
Parallels support 
I didn't miss the Window at all. SupportXP/Vista. Window Xp runs even faster and stable on MBP than the PC.
Slim design, weight 
Only 5.3lbs, lighter than another 15.4 laptop.  
Web cam, bluetooth, Isync, build in Mic. Apple just make very thing user friendly, they know what user looking for. 
At the end, I Iike the touch of the keyboard.
Con: Pricey. But worth every penny

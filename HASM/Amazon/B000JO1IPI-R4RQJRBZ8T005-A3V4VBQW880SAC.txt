Title: A big disappointment! Don't buy
Content:
Unfortunately this iPod has been a big disappointment for me. I am giving two stars only for its storage capacity of 80GB. It can play MP well but it is not able to handle photos and videos to the extent it can handle MP3. Apple is perhaps over rating this. The iTunes software sucks, unless you have a backup of all your photos and videos it is not worth putting in iPod and it occupies lot of space in the computer for synching. I have to look for some other better media player in the market or wait until one arrives.

Title: lots of output for a very small heater
Content:
this little heater is not inexpensive to purchase but it works as well as those twice and even larger in size. The porcelain "chips /wafers" , whatever , serve as the heating element instead of wire resistors as in other plug-in fan type heaters and I have not compared electrical draw but it's small, quiet, and it heats a space like much larger heaters would. I am very pleased with the product and would buy another if I didn't live in such a small space. Perfect for instantly heating your bathroom and it also has a temperature setting so you can use it to regulate heat in your space just as you would any temperature controlled heating device.

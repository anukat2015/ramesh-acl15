Content:
This is the best small vacuum I have ever used.  Prior to receiving this, I bought and returned two others for lack of power.  This one really SUCKS (in a good, vacuumey-way)!!!  
The bagless feature is great because at the end of vacuuming you can clean the dirt-holder and HEPA filter with water and reduce the dust even further.
I have two dogs (one collie), and a cat, and this 12-volt vacuume really does a great job, especially for a canister--much easier to push than an upright.

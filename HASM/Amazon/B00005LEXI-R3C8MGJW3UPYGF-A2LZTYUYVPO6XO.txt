Title: very nice
Content:
Nice little heater, will heat up your garage or any enclosed space in no time. I like the self ignite feature and the safety tip shut-off.  Wind tends to blow out the flame.  Get the connection hose to a larger propane bottle if you will be using this for extended periods.  consider 10000 or more BTU's!

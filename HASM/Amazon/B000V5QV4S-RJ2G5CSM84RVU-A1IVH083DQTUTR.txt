Title: Just buy it.
Content:
After my Digital Rebel XT died on me on the first day of a five day trip to the Amazon, I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I have only used it a few times, but I can tell you it's sweet!  The best improvement over the Rebel XT is the auto-focus ability  -  one giant step forward.  The focus used to wander quite often using my 75-300 IS lens, but not anymore.  Thank you!

Title: No problem filling with water for us
Content:
One thing I've read is some people's trouble filling it with water.  No problems, here.  The reservoir may have a smaller opening than other machines, but we don't have any problem with it.
Also, no problem with the pot dribbling when you pour.  If you try to pour fast, sure it's going to drip.  Pour at a normal pace and you're fine.
Programming is easy.  Having the 1-4 cup setting is nice for times you're making coffee for 1 person.
My only complaint (it's a small one) is the cord could be 1 ft longer.  This would allow us to put it elsewhere on our counter so we could leave the lid open after emptying the coffee so the insides can air dry.

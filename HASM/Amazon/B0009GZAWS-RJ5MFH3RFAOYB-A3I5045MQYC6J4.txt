Title: best investment in a long time
Content:
I love this camera. I love it.
I use D70s at my job. I decided to buy a D50 to save a few bucks. In my oppinion, the D50 performs just as well as the D70. I am completely satisfied.
The camera is very light in weight and is very comfortable around the neck. The camera is surprisingly simple to operate. The manual is very comprehensable. Al camera functions are explained clearly. The standard battery has decient life, but I purchased a 7-hour battery to be on the safe side. I have an overhead light accessory, but the camera's light is marvelous to begin with. The 28-80 lens offers great quality in both close range and long range shots. The resolution of LCD screen is crisp and clean.  
My few complaints are strictly personal. Because I've spent months working with a D70, I am still getting used to what the D50 can and can't do. I am not at all disappointed with the D50 itself. 
Buying this camera and several accessories took a notable chunk out of my wallet, but the cost matched the quality. 
If you are new to Digital SLRs, remember to buy an extra battery, a quick charger, and a memory card. A simple 1-gig memory card should be more than sufficent.

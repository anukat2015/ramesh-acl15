Title: Fatal Flaw in Otherwise Solid Product
Content:
Many of the reviews mention that the on/off switch doesn't work after a while. Well, mine broke after just 2 days. This is because there is a fatal flaw somewhere in the manufacturing of the product, and the button simply fails at a very high rate. I bought one of these at a department store, and it didn't turn on/off at all. Then I bought another from Amazon, hoping to fix the problem and get a better deal, but now the button on this one has stopped working after TWO DAYS! Since I love the design of the product otherwise, I went to the store, bought a switch, and wired it in myself. It looks horrible, and I've spent about 2 hours dealing with it, but at least it works.
Should Cuisinart, an otherwise respectable brand, really be putting this kind of garbage on the market? From the looks of the reviews, this switch is failing very often. I don't write reviews of products as a general practice, but this was so infuriating that I took the time to do so. 
Don't buy this product unless you want to return it sooner or later because of a broken on/off switch.

Title: Whole room of WHAT size?
Content:
This heater might work well in a smaller, enclosed room, but it did absolutely nothing for my open dining room.  One of its flaws is that the heat is emitted from the top, so if you're trying to get your feet warm (Important! helps your whole body warm up), you're out of luck, as the top of the heater is about two feet off the floor.  Also, I don't know if it's just a personal preference of mine or if there really is a difference in efficacy, but heaters that BLOW as opposed to those that just RADIATE seem to warm me, and the room, more quickly and efficiently.
As for the other reviewers mentioning that theirs broke after a short period of time, I'm not even going to comment on that, as I've only had mine for a day.  But between the shortcomings I've noticed myself and those I've read about, I'm not going to take any chances.  This thing is getting returned as soon as I can get it back into the box.  I only wish I'd read the reviews before I purchased.

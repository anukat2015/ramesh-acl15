Title: Underpriced! for the results you can get
Content:
Having shot film for over 35 years, I researched DSLRs for over six months.    Cost was not an issue.  The D80 exceeds every need and nearly every want.  I've sold prints in galleries and have clients who buy stock photography images--though I'm hardly even a semi-pro.  I'm a writer who wanted digital to complement magazine assignments.  The D80 is rock solid.  The battery outlasts the 2Gb memory card.  I use the 18-200 VR Zoom, and if the camera has a shortcoming, it's that 3 fps isn't much if you're at a sporting event.  There's a great focus lock though that takes care of nearly all that might otherwise be a problem.  A buyer needs to know clearly, though, that camera's don't make bad photographs--photographers do.  Learn all you can about the D80 and let it work for you.  It's a great piece of equipment.

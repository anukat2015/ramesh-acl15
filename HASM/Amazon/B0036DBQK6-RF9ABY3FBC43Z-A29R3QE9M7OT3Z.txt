Title: Great little laptop
Content:
This is a great little laptop if you hate (or are tired of) squinting at the 10.1 inch displays of the netbooks, and hate lugging around laptops that barely qualify as carry on luggage.
The size is perfect -- the display and keyboard are perfect.
It doesn't heat up your lap like other laptops. Most other laptops run so hot that I suspect a majority of infertility problems in men could be traced to this problem!
The power supply and the connector are extremely well designed. I especially like the fact that the plug has right tip so that it doesn't project straight out of the PC.
One thing though.. don't expect netbook like battery life. I was a bit hopeful considering the screen size and the 6-cell battery spec. The battery seems to last only about 3 1/2 hours. Which is still easily double the battery life of any laptop I've ever owned.
Not having HDMI is definitely a minus. But I compromised. Also, I wish they'd ponied up 4GB of ram instead of the niggardly 3GB.
All told, I am very happy with this laptop.

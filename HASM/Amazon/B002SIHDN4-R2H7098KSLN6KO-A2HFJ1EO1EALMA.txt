Title: Worst computer I have owned
Content:
Incredibly disappointed in this machine. The quality is 1/10th of the Thinkpads I have owned in the past. It is compact and a good weight but it is no where close to what I need in a portable machine for business. It doesn't even have a vga port! Further it has a psuedo docking station that is a complete joke. The whole machine vibrates from the loud fan and is very annoying when typing on the keyboard. Strongly advise against purchasing this machine for portable business use.

Title: Great for everyday use
Content:
I bought this to make a quick cup of coffee before work -- it works great to set up the night before, hit the button in the morning, and grab the cup and go on the way the door (hence the name, I guess).  I don't have any complaints -- if you don't overfill the brew basket, there's no problem with overflow, and, no, the mug is not the best in the world, but come on, the whole coffee maker costs less than a travel mug from St**bucks.  Overall, it's a great value, and it is a quick and easy way to get your coffee and be on your way.

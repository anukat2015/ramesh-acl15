Title: It is just 'ok'
Content:
I bought this item elsewhere on sale after researching bag-less vacuums that make claims to being great with pet hair. I have three cats, two of whom have very long hair. I have owned and used this vacuum for about a year.
Pros:
Strong suction; decent, general cleaning ability.
Cons:
One| Despite the strong suction (it seems to pull itself forward along the carpet), it doesn't pick up everything. It gets some hair, and leaves some. It picks up most litter, but leaves some.
Two| It doesn't perform very well on non-carpeted surfaces
Three| The filter gets clogged often (the one right before the deposit chamber). And while the filter is easy to remove and clean, it is rather difficult to re-install.
Four| The hose and its attachments are no where near as strong... it seems the vacuum loses much of its strength. The manufacturer's picture of the Turbo brush getting tons of animal hair off a sofa does not represent my experience.
I gave this product three starts because I think it neither worthy of much praise or much criticism

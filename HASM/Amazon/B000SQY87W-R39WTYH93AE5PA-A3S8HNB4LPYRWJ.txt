Title: NewAir ACP-1000E ...Water evaporation STOPPED working??!
Content:
It worked perfectly for 3 months. And then BAMN. Suddenly the water tank is constantly filling. It fills every hour!   
The humidity is not over 80%..Nor is it even 80. It's actually been between 40 ad 60... and fyi (I used to run this while it rained out infact and never had to empty it)  
And no I am not running the de humidifier.  
The only explaination this leaves is somehow the evaportation feature for the condensation is not working anymore? Or something has caused excess condensation n any case the unit cannot keep up with it and am always having to empty the tank.   Really a hassle when this is in the middle of the night and trying to sleep in the heat....
Will be calling the dealer I got it from tommorow. Maybe they have answers?    As I cannot find any ANYwhere. Not in trouble shootig not on any site.   
Really frusterating.

Title: Thinking about a D90, Buy it.
Content:
Not much I can say that hasn't been said already.
The D90 is an outstanding camera, user friendly, takes great photos. I upgraded from a D60 and in short the D60 and D90 aren't even on the same planet. IQ is noticeably better, even more at high ISO's. No more surfing though menus to change settings on the fly, just push a button and move one of the dials. Live view is nice if you like to use it. The 11 point AF is excellent and fast.
If you are thinking about getting one, just do it, you will be very pleased you did.

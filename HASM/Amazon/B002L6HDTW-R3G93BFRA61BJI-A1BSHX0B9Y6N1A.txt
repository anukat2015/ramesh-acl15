Title: Great MP3 player if you just want to listen to music
Content:
The shuffle is a great little MP3 player. There is no display, but if you build your play list in the order you want to listen, it doesn't matter. Frankly, I usually just select random play anyway. Additionally, this "older model" has the volume on the device itself, so I'm glad I was able to find it. The newer units moved the volume control to the headset, which means you are stuck using a headset with a volume control on it.

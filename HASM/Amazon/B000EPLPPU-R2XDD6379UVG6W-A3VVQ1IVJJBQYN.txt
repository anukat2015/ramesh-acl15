Title: Does what I bought it for
Content:
I bought this specifically to use at the gym and on airplanes.  The small size and controls that are easy to use without looking at them are great for both.  
Using iTunes isn't that bad, but you really have to pick ONE computer for this device and only use it with that.  Even if you try just to play the iPod through a different computer it won't let you.  I created several different play lists in iTunes and every now an then sync a new one on the iPod, even though all the lists would fit at once.  I do this because the shuffle does not have its own concept of a play list and forwarding through the songs to find the one you are in the mood for gets old.  
In summary, limited, but good for specific things.  Don't mistake this for a more general purpose player.

Title: This coffee pot is the best
Content:
I purchased this coffee pot for my office.  I love the color as it does not stain, I love not having a nasty, dirty looking carafe and it is so easy to use.  The coffee seems to stay longer without that nasty burnt coffee smell and taste and stays warm for a long time.  I love the ability to program the coffee so when the staff come in first thing in the morning the coffee is already made and ready to drink.

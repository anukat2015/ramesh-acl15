Title: A true masterpiece
Content:
I like the concept and firmness of the designers, they knew what they wanted in the market. Some reviewers are wrong about the absence of the screen, the concept of the design makes the longed and heartfelt desired screen useless, uncomfortable, inadequate and irrelevant.
The only thing I find dangerous from a commercial point of view is the mistake made offering those poor Apple earphones. The inclusion of modest Sennheiser CX300 or AKG K27i would not have been so expensive and the improvement is notable and worth mentioning. Unsurpassable design and excellent sound using the modest earphone and heaphone mentioned or if you prefer to pay an unjustified price ---too expensive--- buy Etymotic Research ER4P. In short: this Second Generation iPod Shuffle is a true masterpiece, ideal not only for jogging or the gym.

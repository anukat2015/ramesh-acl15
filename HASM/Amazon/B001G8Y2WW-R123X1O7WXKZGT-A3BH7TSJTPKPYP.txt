Title: New & Improved
Content:
I love the new look!  We had the older version for about 6 years.  This new one is sleeker and much easier to clean and keep clean (the inside where the grinder sits gets cakey due to condensation).  I got it for $149, used Amazon Prime, and had it in a few days!  I love it.  If you're thinking of getting this grind and brew with stainless carafe, it is nice.  Some parts will have to be replaced over the years like the older version, but the taste of the freshly ground coffee every day is worth it. I never pre-heat the carafe like the directions say because that defeats the purpose of the timer. I've never had an issue with the coffee temperature, it's always hot! I also recommend hand-washing over dishwasher.  The carbon filters are similar to Brita and can be found for cheap at Kohl's. One other note is it only makes 10 cups as opposed to the typical 12 cups.  This is fine for me because it's just me and my husband, but if you need to make a ton of coffee regularly, this may not be a good choice.  Overall, I love it and I'm glad I traded up!

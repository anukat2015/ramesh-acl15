Title: Its old but works great!
Content:
I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to spend a lot of money on an MP3 player. My Dell DJ has froze on me to date (had it for at least 4 years) about 3 times. There is a restart button (just like on PDA phones) that fixes the problem in a few seconds. It reboots and your back to listening to one of your 5,000 songs. The MP3 player is bulky compared to an IPOD but it is not as wide as a standard PDA phone but probably as thick. I have a sports carrying case and it works great for my workouts (running, cycling, and on the elliptical machines). I haven't had it skip and I have even dropped it a few times. Both sides of my head phones work and even when I play it in the car it works on both speakers. I know that some of the Dell DJs had this problem but I can assure you that not all of them were defective. Overall this is a great product for me (and possibly you too) and it is really cheap for the amount of storage it has (8GB Apple IPOD will run you around $200).

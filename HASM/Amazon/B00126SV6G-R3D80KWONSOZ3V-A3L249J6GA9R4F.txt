Title: Good concept, mediocre execution
Content:
I tried the product because the price & form are fantastic.   The unit itself, at least the version I received, has many flaws.  I had to reset the unit several times each week.  When I asked tech support, they said it was a normal unit and to keep resetting.
Some cd's were in the music list properly by title but then not listed properly by author.  Others were exactly the opposite.  I got a message the device was full but I barely had 1 gig of files.  I deleted everything I could and it still gave me the error.  The earphone jack came apart 2 weeks after I got it.  
The software is really unstable and virtually unusable.  If they could fix the reliability of the device and the software that comes with it, I like the functionality and will try it again perhaps in a few months.

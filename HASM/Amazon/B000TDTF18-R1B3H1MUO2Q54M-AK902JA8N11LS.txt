Title: wonderful coffeemaker
Content:
i purchased this item because it was the only one i could find at the time with the front loading feature at a reasonable price. it's nice to not have to pull  the machine out from underneath the cabinets everyday just to add water & coffee. i have been using this coffeemaker daily for over a year with zero problems. aroma brewing feature produces a nice strong cup of coffee. carafe doesn't drip when pouring. my only minor complaint is that the cup measurement on the carafe doesn't seem to equate to the water level on the machine. i just judge by the reading on the carafe and coffee tastes great. some reviews on here mention that coffee is not hot enough, but i haven't found this to be a problem at all. overall, i highly recommend this product.

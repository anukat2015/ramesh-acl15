Title: Good coffee from this little coffee maker
Content:
I was skeptical that this coffee maker would brew a good cup of coffee.  I bought three when these were on sale here for $4.99 (yes, just shy of five bucks).  Figured it couldn't be that bad, and the reviews supported that.  Sure enough, this DCM7 makes great coffee.  Hot, and very fast.  Just need to heed the warnings to use 4" or shorter coffee mugs.  Very pleased with this.  Have one spare, and one is going to my daughter for Christmas.  Even at $15, this is well worth the cost!

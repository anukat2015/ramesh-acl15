Title: The netbook of my dreams
Content:
I've wanted a netbook for a couple years now, but the specs for most netbooks were subpar.  Typically, netbooks only have 1gig of memory, which just isn't acceptable when it comes to playing video or even multitasking.
The Acer Aspire AS1410 is technically not a netbook because it has 2gigs of memory and an Intel Centrino processor.  Even though it has just one core, it's much faster than the Atom chips of most netbooks.
I'm enjoying my Acer so far.  It's light and I can easily carry it up and down the stairs and from room to room.  I don't feel like I'm lugging a huge weight around.  I find myself using the Acer more than my more powerful laptop just because the Acer is so portable.
It's also small and light enough to fit in my carry on bag, so it's great for travel.  The battery lasts about 4 hours when it's being used intensively, far less than the 6 hours of life Acer claims.  However, I expected this since most laptop companies base their run times on running low intensity programs.
The one irritation I have with this computer is the touch pad.  Using the multi-touch feature you can increase the size of fonts and graphics.  The problem is that the mouse buttons abut the touch pad, which no one space between the buttons and the pad.  I often find myself accidentally touching the touch pad while my fingers are on the mouse buttons.  When this happens, the page gets bigger or smaller.  I think I'll get used to this, but it is irritating.
Overall, I love this computer and glad I picked it over the more basic netbooks out there.

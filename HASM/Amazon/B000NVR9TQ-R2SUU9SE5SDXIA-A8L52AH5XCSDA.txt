Title: Do not buy this
Content:
This is the worst A/C I have ever seen. First of all, even though it says on the box "ultra quiet", it is nearly as noisy as vacuum cleaner, you won't be able to sleep or talk while it is on. Also it doesn't cool well, we have a very small bedroom {only big enough to fit a queen size bed and two dressers, with not much room left} and it doesn't cool it nearly as well as our old GE Air Conditioner {that is only 5000 BTU}. I am taking it back today and will rather wait for a nicer one {all the stores are out of A/C right now and this one was the only one we found, but better nothing then this one}

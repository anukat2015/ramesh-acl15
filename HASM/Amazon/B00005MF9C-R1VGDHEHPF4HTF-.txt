Title: Warning
Content:
The one I gave my mother turns itself on and off as if it has a mind of its own.  Once I plugged it in and then went to the tap to get the water, while I had my back to it, it turned itself on.  Thats right it turned itself on.  Unknowingly I poured the water into the resevoir and the heat from the heating element forced the water to turn to steam and spit back out.

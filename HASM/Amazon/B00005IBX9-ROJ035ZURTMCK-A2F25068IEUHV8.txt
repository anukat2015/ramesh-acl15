Title: Nearly the Perfect coffee pot.
Content:
I've been in Love with the Brew quality of Cuisinart coffee Pots since I owned the original Grind & Brew.  Cuisinart continues to make GREAT coffee makers HOWEVER, I have one HUGE PET PEEVE. The Coffee burner burns the coffee way to fast on low!
When I brew a full pot (to drink myself) it may take 2+ hours to finish the pot.  If I leave the burner on Low it still burns in about an hour.  I have to flip the switch on and off between refills to keep from burning my gourmet coffees!
My original Grind & Brew had a LED 10 position burner temperature setting.  Set at 3 or 4 I could have coffee on the burner for 2+hours and it was hot yet not burnt.  This is my third Cuisinart and each on since the first has had this issue.

Title: Nice Surprise
Content:
With most electric heaters this size I've alway seen the elements glowing
orange and becoming VERY hot whenever it's turned on.  But with this heater you don't see the orange glow, but you can feel the heat real well.  I can even feel the heat when I'm more than 6 feet from the it!  It's very quiet and doesn't even make any noise when it's heating up.  Although it costs more than many electric space heaters, it's well worth the price!

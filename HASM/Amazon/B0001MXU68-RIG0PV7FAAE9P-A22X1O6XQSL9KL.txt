Title: Average Coffee
Content:
I recieved this machine as a Christmas gift. I had asked for a Senso.  I HATE the fact that you have to use Melitta coffee.  It is very dificult to find in local stores, Target carries a few varietys...for now.  So basically you'll have to go online to buy your coffee. Senso pods on the other hand are avaiable everywhere. Quite frankly the coffee isn't much better than instant and no where near as good as a cheap french press.  There is no froth like the Senso. I was however pleased with the tea and Ice tea. But then again, is it any easier to use this machine than a tea bag and a cup of water in a microwave?

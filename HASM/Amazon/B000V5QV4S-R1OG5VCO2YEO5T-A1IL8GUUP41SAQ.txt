Content:
I've owned this camera for about 6 months now and love it. I use it as a primary with a 30D as back-up and shoot sports with a Sigma 120-300 2.8 lens. The 6.5fps shutter speed ensures I get the perfect shot and the metering is spot on. I debated buying the 50D when I purchased this camera, but after considerable research I am convinced the pixel density on the 50D is so great, my image yield would be marginally better especially considering I am shooting at fast shutter speeds and high frame per second rates.

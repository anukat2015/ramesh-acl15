Title: Great camera for few money
Content:
This is my first camera in the digital area and I am really happy with the camera.  I had a photography course and I really learned how to use it and enjoy it.  Currently, I am sure that I can take great pictures, 50% depends on the time you spend creating the scenary, flashs, lights, etc. and 50% on your technic and artistic skills.  Honestly, no one needs more than 6 Megapixes, because you can print a great picture 10" x 8" with 6MP, so I think this is a great option, and you can invest your extra money buying a tripod, remote control, additional flashes (Really needed and important).

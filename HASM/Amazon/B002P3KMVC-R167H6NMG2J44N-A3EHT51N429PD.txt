Title: Great Laptop
Content:
Pros: This laptop is so light I love it. I have also gotten alot of comments about the laptop. The keyboard is silent enough for my taste and is very comfortable. The track pad also has some special control features which come in handy. 
Cons: I am not particularly fond of the single mouse button. Its ok but I would rather prefer the two buttons but I will just have to get used to it. Finger print magnet. The outside doesnt really get finger prints but the inside definitely does to the right and left of the trackpad. Kinda annoying and wish it was matte but the sheen makes it look fancy i guess.  The cam is only a .3 MP which is crap but i didnt get this thing for the camera.
Other thoughts: For the one complaining about hitting the track pad while typing, you can turn it off using the function button. As a matter of fact there are many function buttons that are available. You will need to check the manual for those functions. The battery life is what sells this computer however I was a bit surprised by the charger. It is smaller than a normal charger but It gets a little too warm on the border of hot. Hopefully its not an electrical problem. 
I recommend this laptop who needs a light machine with a long battery life. Hopefully it hold up and performs well when I start using my engineering programs. (I am a college student)

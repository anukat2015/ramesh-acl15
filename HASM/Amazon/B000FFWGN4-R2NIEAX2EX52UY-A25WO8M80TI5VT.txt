Title: Great Vacuum for the price
Content:
I was up in the air for months over wheather to spend $500 for a Dyson pet or to just buy a pet vacuum. I really, really wanted a Dyson but in this economy and for our lifestyle, I simply could not imagine spending that much money on a vacuum. I dont care who it's made by. So i bought this bissell pet vacuum and I am very satisfied. It picked up the hair well. I have 4 English Mastiffs who shed a lot! I found that this vacumm picked up all the hair and a lot of dander and dirt from the carpet. At the end of the day, A vacuum will be a vacumm. Its man made and plastic so they are bound to break and not continue to pick up hair after many many uses. Thankfully for me where I bought mine, it has a lifetime warranty which is better than any Dyson! 
I like the fact that the cord comes out the side.
I like that the canister comes off.
not too heavy to take up and down stairs.
I like the new power switches

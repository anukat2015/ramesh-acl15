Title: stay away - mousepad sucks
Content:
Everything is great about this laptop - light weight, looks are good, processor is fine, price is right BUT mousepad sucks - sometimes i keep dragging my finger on the mousepad and the cursor hardly moves. So frustrating. I had to use a mouse, which has defeated the whole purpose of buying a laptop i.e. I cannot carry it around, I just have to set it up on the table and connected with a mouse. I am sending it back. Other users have also complained about mousepad.

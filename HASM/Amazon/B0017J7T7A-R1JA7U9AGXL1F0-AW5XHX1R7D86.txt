Title: I should've bought this at the Apple store.
Content:
I bought this laptop on through Amazon  as a replacement for my older macbook pro, who's videocard failed.  The price dropped significantly within a week of my purchase and Amazon wouldn't make an adjustment so I'm very disappointed in Amazon's service but still love my Mac. The battery life isn't what I expected and this model has been replaced by another model with a permanent battery and up to 8 hours life... so they say.

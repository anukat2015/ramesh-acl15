Title: Not worth the money or headache
Content:
Loved it until it started leaking water all over the countertop after 1 month. Although it's under warranty, I need to pay to send it 1000 miles away to a service center and will be without it for unknown amount of time.  Also, can't send just the tank portion (which visibly drips water when filled). I have to ship the whole unit...of course, the box has been recycled. Definitely not worth the money.

Title: HP Pavilion DV9650US 17" -- HD DVD flaw
Content:
One of the reasons I chose this model was the technology to use this laptop as a digital tv tuner, DVR, and HD DVD player, hooked up to a big flat panel LCD TV display, via HDmi, component video cables, etc.  Well -- when play a HD DVD it only fills up about 1/3 of the screen in hp's "quickplay" program.  No apparent way to use the full screen for the movie.  So much for 17"!  Okay, well -- it should be viewed on the big LCD TV anyway, so I hook it up via HDMI. "Cannot display in this [two screen or other screen] display configuration" blocks image!  DRM-evil strikes to rip off the consumer again!  What a waste!  Why buy an HD DVD drive (or sony blu-ray) if it won't export image to the TV?  Save your money - get a similar model without an HD DVD (or blu-ray) drive.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong but it appears quite pointess at this time. 
This package is otherwise nice.  Though - yes, the tiny shift key is witless, given the giant 17" keyboard!

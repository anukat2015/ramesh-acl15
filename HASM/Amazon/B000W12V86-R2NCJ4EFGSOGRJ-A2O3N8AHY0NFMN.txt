Title: Excelent deal!!
Content:
I bought this computer 2 weeks ago. You get more for the price you pay. 
I read the reviews and people complained about the keyboard been hot. Is not annyoing you can get use to it. 
Reminder: Uninstall and stop services from the bunch of trash applications that come with Vista and HP tools.

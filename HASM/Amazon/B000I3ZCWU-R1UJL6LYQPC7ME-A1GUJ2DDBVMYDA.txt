Title: Amazing Camera and Amazing Pics!!
Content:
This is a superb camera.. I spent several days looking at reviews to decide which SLR camera to purchase and finally settled on this one. I have not used DSLRs before and obviously cannot compare one with other but on absolute terms this one is awesome. You might want to get some additional lenses before you actually are able to do  the fun stuff with this camera..
I find the location of the click button a bit awkward. You have to bend your index finger in an awkward fashion to be able to click the snap..
The rest looks damn good..

Title: Wow, great pics for great price. Opposite of buyer's remorse.

Summary for those who want the punchline:  Moved up from 100 dollar point and shoot, don't have a lot of money, first dslr, amazed.
     I've been using a 100 dollar point and shoot for about a year and a half, and I found that I liked photography, and I was encouraged by others to pursue it further.  So I got 3 pics published in my university's art journal, and now this summer i decided to go for the DSLR, to see if I could pursuit this hobby more rigourously.
    I'm still in school, and so on a tight budget, but I couldn't be happier blowing my summer's first paycheck on this thing.  For 600 dollars, a whole new world of opportunities with photography were opened up.  The dual lenses, lets me try macro shots but also allows me to zoom in for crisp images on those further away items.
    The picture quality is great, you can crop an image drastically and still maintain resolution better than a 5 or 6mp point and shoot.
    I'm aware that Canon and Nikon are supposed to be the top quality contenders, and I envision that several years from now, with a meatier income purchasing one.  But I won't bother for a while, because this thing is fantastic.
   If you are on a tight budget and are looking to bump up to a dslr, this is the ticket: two lenses offer versatility, the camera is a solid platform, and the quality is exceptional.  I was hesitant after I placed the order that it might not be worth the money... but now I couldn't be happier.  This thing has made me serious about photography as a hobby, and maybe more.

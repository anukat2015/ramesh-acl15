Title: worth the $$
Content:
I hate vacuuming, so even though we're on a tight budget, I was determined to get something that I wouldn't curse every time I had to drag it out (and that would last a long time).  This machine is the ticket.  It's beautifully designed, with nice features like the catch that holds the wand upright when you park the vac.  It's incredibly small and lightweight, it's quiet, it's simple, and all the parts click together and apart effortlessly, unlike the $350 Eureka we had that was a pain in the patooti from the day we got it 'til the day its circuit board died and couldn't be replaced.  
A couple of caveats to consider: I gave it 5 stars because overall, it's head and shoulders above any other vac I've owned and I love using it, but the turbo brush is definitely not a power head - it takes some practice to get the same results.  It's probably not suitable for a house with a lot of carpeting - we have bare floors and scatter rugs (that said, it's doing fine with the fur from 2 dogs and a long-haired cat).  Also, the tools ride in a holder on the wand, not in the vac housing, and that can occasionally be inconvenient.  The salesman we bought from recommended the Pisces as being somewhat more convenient - the tools store on board and it's got a larger bag capacity.  But in our little house on our little budget, this machine is really all I could ask for.  I'd buy it again.

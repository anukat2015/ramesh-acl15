Title: Poorly Made Product
Content:
After having the original Shark vacuum and a good experience with it, we purchased the Shark Roadster when the first one stopped working.  We got the vacuum home, opened it up and tried to use - but, it wouldn't turn on b/c the on/off button was broken.  So, without ever even using the vacuum once, we brought it back to Target and replaced it for a new one.  
We used the new one seven times, and on the eighth time, after about five minutes, it overheated and shut off.  We attempted to use it an hour later after letting it cool down and had no luck... the next day the vacuum turned on, but none-the-less, we are going to be bringing the SECOND run through of this vacuum back. We are not a glutton for punishment, so we will not be trading ihis one in for a new piece of junk.  
On a positive not, for a small vacuum, the machine does have great suction. But, it is cheaply made and not built to last (as much of today's products are).  So, if you aren't prepared for the hassle of purchasing and returning the item frequently, I would stay away from this product!

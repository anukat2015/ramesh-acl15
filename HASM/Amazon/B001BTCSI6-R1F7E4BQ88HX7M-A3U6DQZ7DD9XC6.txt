Title: Just awesome!
Content:
I was trying to decide between purchasing the D700 and the Canon 5D MkII.  I liked the prospect of the significantly lower prices of the Canon lenses and slightly higher MP count of the 5D.  But those differences don't necessarily lead to better pics.  Well, I went with the Nikon and am simply amazed.  I purchased the Nikon 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6G ED IF Autofocus VR Nikkor Zoom Lens, the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens, the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G SIC SW Prime Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, the Nikon 105mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor Lens, the Nikon SB-900 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, and a pair of Lexar Professional Series UDMA 16 GB 300x CompactFlash Memory Card CF16GB-300-381 to go along with a couple of lenses I already had from a previous Nikon N8008.  I used this camera on my family's Disney vacation during the week of Christmas to Jan 3.  Photographing Disney at night was simply stunning with the D700.  This is not to mention the incredible daylight photos it produces.  The menus are very easy to navigate and setup your custom settings for different subject and lighting conditions.  I was very tired of the poor results from the point-and-shoot cameras so I decided to take the plunge into real photography again.  I've found a new hobby!  One item that never ceases to amaze me is the auto focus ability of the D700.  It just ALWAYS gets the subject in focus.  I can't explain it any different than that.  Even during low light conditions (night time) it's spot on.  I had a great time taking night shots at Epcot.  The results were awesome.  The camera is a little heavy for a walkabout camera, but the results more than make up for the slight inconvenience it is.

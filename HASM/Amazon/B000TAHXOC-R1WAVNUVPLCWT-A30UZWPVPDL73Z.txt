Title: Do not buy this air conditioner!!!
Content:
We purchased this unit to cool our bedroom, which is about 15x15. It cannot keep up with the heat and frequently trips the circuit breaker. We had another window unit before this one and we never had trouble with it; it was also 8000 BTU. We solved the frequent water-changing problem by running a line out the window beside the air duct. We're going to return this piece of junk and buy a nicer, bigger window unit.

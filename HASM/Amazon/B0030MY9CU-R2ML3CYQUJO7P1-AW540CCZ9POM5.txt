Title: so far so good
Content:
The customer reviews @ Walmart and Consumer Reports convinced me this was the best value.  Best thing so far was at start up, it knew we were using Linksys, asked to confirm, and instant internet access.  Wow!  Second thing worth noting is it's every bit as fast as my new HP 500 GB tower.
Some of the reviews said the unit gets pretty warm so I ordered a three fan cooler and a wireless mouse.  Amazon came through again as even with these add ons, I still paid less for everything then what Walmart wanted just for the laptop.

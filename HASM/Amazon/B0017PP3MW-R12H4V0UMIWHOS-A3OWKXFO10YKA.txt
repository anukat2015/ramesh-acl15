Title: I love this Vacuum!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum from BedBathandBeyond with a 20% coupon.  It is very lightweight and moves around very easily, a great feature for me since I have arthritis.  I have mostly hardwood floors, but it also came with a power nozzle for carpets, which works very well on my oriental rugs. The cord rewind is great and it stores upright and has a telescoping wand and a park feature, useful when taking a break.  The suction is very good and bags are easy to change. Overall, a great compact vacuum, but make sure it comes with the power nozzle if you have rugs.

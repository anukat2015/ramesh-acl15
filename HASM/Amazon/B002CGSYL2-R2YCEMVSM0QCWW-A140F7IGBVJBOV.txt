Title: It's Confusing
Content:
It's confusing.
Does the E-P1 include two wiewfinders? No determinating is forthcoming from Amazon. I bought it from someone else (Beach). Good luck to me for finding a line in. Supposedly it will be all right!
I blame Olympus for this. Is not the manifest on the Web the right, the true? Supposedly. it's true! Nonsense. We get what we pay for, right?
Nonsense! Garbage in, garbage out!

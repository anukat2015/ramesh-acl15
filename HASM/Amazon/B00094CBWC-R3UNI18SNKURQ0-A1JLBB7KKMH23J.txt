Title: better off spending a little more...
Content:
I bought a Vornado heater and was very happy with it.  I wanted another one and should have stuck with a sure thing.  Instead I let the lower price of the Holmes lure me in.  Not the same.  :(  It's true, you get what you pay for.  If you must buy the cheaper heater, go to Target and get 30% off all their heaters now at least.  I just saw this heater for $25 at Target.  I'm going back to Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon and buying another Vornado. Their coupons never expire by the way even though they have an expiration date.

Title: Black & Decker for 25 years
Content:
I've been using the B&D one cup coffee makers for about 25 years.  They haven't changed much over the years and each one has lasted about 5 years.  This is the first one I've been disappointed in it.  It still makes a great cup of coffee, but the bottom is now plastic instead of metal and is "warped" so that the unit does not set flat on the counter.  It is wobbly to the point that I need to prop it up.

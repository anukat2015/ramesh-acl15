Title: Just does NOT do the job!!
Content:
Normally a big fan of all Honeywell products, I am very disappointed in this Surround Tower heater.  It just does NOT do the job, even in the 
relatively small office area in which I have it set up.  Not enough 
heat output to take the chill off, let alone supply a heat source for
a small room.  Do not waste your money--

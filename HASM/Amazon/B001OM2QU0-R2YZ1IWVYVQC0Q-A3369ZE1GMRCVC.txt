Title: Volume too low
Content:
I like everything about this laptop except for the factory preset low volume.. at the 100% setting, it is way too low (and I have normal hearing). There is nothing that can be done to make it louder except to purchase speakers, which is what I did. Of course the speakers require electric current and a table top, so then the laptop becomes a desktop which sort of defeats the purpose of having a laptop. Had I known about the volume issue before purchase, I would not have chosen this one.

Title: Great "my first laptop", but scared to shop online
Content:
The computer  is great my daughter loves it! The only problem I had was with Amazon! I paid extra to have it deliver that Saturday and didn't get it until Tuesday. When I called them that Sunday, they told me it had been delivered to the wrong address and they would send another free of charge. I was upset because they made me feel like it was my fault. My extra shipping was not refunded and UPS was mean to me. Now I'm scared to make purchases online because that was alot of money in limbo and no security.

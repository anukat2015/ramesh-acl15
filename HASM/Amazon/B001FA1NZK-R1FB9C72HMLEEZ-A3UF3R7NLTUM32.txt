Title: itouch 2nd Gen
Content:
This is one of 2 itouch I purchased.....I bought one for Christmas for my 8 year old daughter and my 5 year old  son loved it so much, I decided to purchase a second one for his bday in jan.  This is a much better buy compared to a Nintendo DS.  You can download alot of games for free vs. $[...] a game for the DS.  I am itching to get one for myself but trying to hold back.  I give the 16GB a thumbs up!!!

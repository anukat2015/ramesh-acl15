Title: Lives up to the good reviews
Content:
This Cuisinart DCC-1100 12 cup coffeemaker is everything I hoped it would be when I ordered it. I do not find it difficult to pour in the water as some people said. Coffee is very tasty and hot enough when brewed. I can pour a cup without dripping all over the place unlike the Braun that I replaced. I recommend it!

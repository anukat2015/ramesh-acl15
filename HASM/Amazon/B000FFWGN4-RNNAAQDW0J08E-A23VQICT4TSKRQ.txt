Title: A decent vacuum for the price
Content:
My husband bought this vacuum for me so that I wouldn't have to carry our older upright up and down the stairs every time I vacuumed the house.  In the past, I have owned Eurekas, and this is my first Bissell.  I have now owned it for a year, and overall, it is a decent product, especially for the price.  
When it comes to getting up pet hair, my house is challenge that few vacuums could manage - with three dogs and two indoor cats, keeping my carpets fur-free is a pretty impossible task.  In our house, the main brush on the vacuum gets clogged with pet-hair with every single use, which is a bit of a pain (since this is supposed to be a vacuum designed for pets), but it is easy enough to clean by putting the vacuum on its back and picking out the hair.  The small attachment that comes with the vacuum (designed for cleaning stairs and furniture), while a wonderful idea, becomes easily tangled as well and is NOT nearly so easy to clean out.  Ours stopped working within six months, and after we took it apart and cleaned it, it continued to stop working regularly.  I'm told this is a common problem.  
Still, the suction is decent - about what you would expect for a model under $200, and I love the multiple filters and the easily-removed and cleaned dust bin.  The hose is nice and stretchy, and the lift-off aspect of the vacuum is very convenient, especially since the complete vacuum is very heavy.  If you are looking for an inexpensive vacuum that will last a couple of years and then need replacing, this vacuum is a good choice, and you will probably get your money's worth.

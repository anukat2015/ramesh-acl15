Title: THE ULTIMATE HEATER
Content:
Ok, i searched, read, searched, read, and re-searched and re-read. You get the idea! THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE SAFEST HEATER!!!!! I have a pool table in the garage, and a very small house heated by propane. I heat up my garage pretty well with the 2 of these. You should always use a small fan on it though. The only thing it does not do well is circulate the heat. I ran out of propane 3 weeks ago. Pretty scary, and we were low on money to refill it until next week. I have one of these and a ceiling fan in my living room. My kitchen is open to my LR. THIS HEATED MY WHOLE HOUSE UP. It did not until i turned on the ceiling fan though. That is how i figured it out to use a fan with it. Now, i have no problem heating anywhere. The pros: Heats incredibly well, not a quick heat, but a deep ambient heat. Hard to explain. It heats the core of the room up, not the surface. The sides, bottom, and the top of the heater never gets hot. The back gets a little warm. The only thing that gets too hot is the front, where the heat is coming out of. I have it on a bookshelf, up against the wall, and there is no danger of anything getting hot. I am so impressed with this product. If you are reading this and wondering if it works good, DEFINATELY! The cons: Providing a small fan pointed at the heater grates increases the warmth. I would suggest a small clip fan, or floor model pointed up at it. Overall this is a small extra price to pay for the best heater. By the way, i have 4 electric heater and when used with an oscilating heater with a fan, WOW!!! Super heated! Thanks for listening.

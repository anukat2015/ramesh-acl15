Title: An emergency room visit waiting to happen!
Content:
My Cuisinart 12-cup coffee maker is only capable of making 9 cups of coffee.  If you try to put more than 9 Tbs of coffee grinds into the basket, the water backs up in the basket and grinds somehow get around the filter and fall down into the carafe.  The whole thing gets clogged up and the only way to enjoy a cup of coffee is to empty out a basket of burning hot water or go out to Starbucks.  This happens with both paper filters and a gold basket filter.  Cuisinart sent me another coffee maker to replace this one, but I don't know if I'm willing to take a chance with it.  I think I'll just sell it on eBay and use the money to get a better brand.  This the first Cuisinart appliance I have every purchased and it will likely be my last.  Overpriced and overhyped.  My last coffee maker was a Melitta and that was wonderful for 4 years.  Wish I didn't break when I moved.

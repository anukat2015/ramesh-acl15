Title: Cute but impossible to use
Content:
I just purchased a Zen Neeon a week ago and have had nothing but problems with it. My tech-savvy fiance couldn't figure out what to do with it. While Creative's online customer support has been prompt and curtious, it hasn't been able to fix my player's problems. Maybe I just have a lemon. Here are just some of the annoying problems with my Zen Neeon:
1. The organizational software does not organize by artist or album. So all songs are in alphabetical order. And having to scroll through 5GB of songs takes forever. I couldn't make it past "e."
2. The navigation is nearly impossible. The buttons and navigation wheel are barely responsive. And sometimes don't work at all.  
3. Even if you upload your music by folders for better organization, the player would not let me play specific folders. I could select a song in one folder and then the player would jump to another folder.
4. My biggest concern was the lag-time between songs.  The player would pause itself with one second to go in each song and then make a sound like it was processing/searching for the next song. This would take anywhere from 10 sec (acceptable) to over a minute (not acceptable).  
5. I've only had my player for a week and I've had to reset it several times. The controls just seem to lock up.
Needless to say, I am really disappointed. I love the look of the Neeon. And the size it great. But it is just so frustrating to use. I'm sending it back to Amazon today. :(

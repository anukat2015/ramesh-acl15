Title: Great little device!
Content:
I bought this device mainly for use with Audiobooks and an occasional podcast.  It's small, the sound is good, the navigation pretty simple and the battery life more than adequate for my needs. The music I've tried on it sounds great but I am using headphones rather than the ear buds it comes with.  Its a very good device for the price. 
My only negative comment would be about the terrible packaging it comes in.  These hard plastic sealed units are terrible to open and I've cut myself more than once on them.

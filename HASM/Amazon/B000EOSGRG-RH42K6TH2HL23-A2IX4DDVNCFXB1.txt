Title: Not much of a hand vac.
Content:
I've been very disappointed in this unit.  It has a cheap feel about it,and I don't think it's very well balanced, weight wise. Most important, the suction is not very good for a unit of this size. I've also not been happy with the lack of storage for the included tools.  You'd be much better off with a B&D Dust Buster - little more expensive, but worth it.

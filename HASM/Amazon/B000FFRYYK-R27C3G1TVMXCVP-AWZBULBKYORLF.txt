Title: Great Value
Content:
We have had several Bunn coffee makers but this is the first with the thermal carafe. The coffee does not burn and maintains its original flavor. Also, it maintains the brewing temperature for several hours (even overnight but with some cooling). We have had this unit about one month now and it is always full of coffee (approx. 6 pots per day). We have been very pleased with this purchase.

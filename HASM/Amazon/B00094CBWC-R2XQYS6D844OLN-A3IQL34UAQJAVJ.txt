Title: Horrible
Content:
Let me tell you the sequence of events for me with this heater. 1) I opened the box. 2) I plugged in the heater. 3) I turned the heater on. 4) It immediately switched off and never turned back on. What an absolute waste of time and money, this is horrible. Don't buy this product because it has an automatic switch off that you can't turn off. The thermostat thing is wrong and you can't fix it or override it.

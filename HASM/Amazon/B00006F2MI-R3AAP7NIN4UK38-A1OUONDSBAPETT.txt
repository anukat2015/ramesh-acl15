Title: Looks nice, doesn't make good coffee
Content:
After convincing a new boss that freshly ground coffee beans makes a better tasting coffee, I purchased this Cuisinart Grind & Brew machine. The machine does grind coffee very well (although loud), but not all the grounds are deposited into the drip basket - thus making the coffee on the weak side. I thought it was just the one machine - returned it to the place of purchase for a new one - but it's the same. I wouldn't recommend this machine - I now need to grind the beans, open the grinder and physically remove the ground coffee to deposit into the drip basket - more hassle than anything!

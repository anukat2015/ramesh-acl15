Title: Love it
Content:
I've read many reviews before buying this, and I am very happy with my purchase.  Great design, just a beautiful machine.  Best notebook I have own.  Fast, runs windows and Mac OS, has built in mic and camera, upgraded video graphics chip is fast.  Love the magnetic power adapter.  I don't have any firewire peripherals, so missing a firewire port is not an issue to.
I love the multi-touch track pad.  I spend most of my time using it to browse the web.  This multi-touch feature makes scrolling around a joy to use.  I appreciated it more every time I have to use my girlfriends HP notebook that doesn't have this feature.
My only concern from reading the reviews is about the screen quality.  However when I went t to Apple store to see check out the product, the screen looked gorgeous.  One of the nicest picture quality I've seen.  Maybe I am not an expert in this area, but I am just not able to tell the difference between the macbook screen and a high quality screen.  I suspect most people are the same.  I would recommend going to the apple store to check it out before buying.  
This product is designed for easily upgrading the DRAM and Hard drive.  Since I occasionally run Windows XP in virtualization, 2 gb of Ram doesn't feel like its enough.  Its nice to know that I can easily upgrade the ram when I want to.

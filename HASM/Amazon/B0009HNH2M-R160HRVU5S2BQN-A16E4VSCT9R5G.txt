Title: Utterly worthless
Content:
We have three cats and a dog and hardwood floors. The vacuum lacks the power to pick up anything reliably on the first pass. I have to constantly stop and vacuum off the floor head as only about half the pet hair it picks up actually gets to the vacuum bag. To get anything against the mopboards, remove the head.
On carpet, it's quiet and leaves so much behind that it's essentially cleaning for looks only. It's simply incapable of removing anything but surface dirt, and that it does poorly.
The cord is far too short; a 25-foot hallway is beyond its reach. The tool holder is on the suction tube, making it impossible to vacuum under the bed or behind the refrigerator. The tools constantly fall off the tool holder, and the crevice tool is inexplicably in the vacuum itself.
Even the "bag full" indicator is counter-intuitive. When the red bar is halfway across, the bag is full and power drops exponentially.
This product certainly warrants a zero-star rating. It's likely to be the last Hoover product I buy.

Title: Absolutely love it!
Content:
Upgraded from an ipod shuffle, and I love this ipod (not that the shuffle wasn't great).  Let me give you my favorite things about the nano 5gen: the video quality, and the quality of the screen are phenominal for the size.  Colors are crisp, clear, and bright.  Genius mixes: pick a song, and it creates a 20-song playlist based on the first song you chose.  It's very intuitive and easy to use, and you can fit a ton of songs, podcasts, and videos on 8GB.

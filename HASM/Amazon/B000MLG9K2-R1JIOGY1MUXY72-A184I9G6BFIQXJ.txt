Title: Amazing Camera
Content:
This camera goes above and beyond anything I could have imagined. It works well the my Sigma lenses I already had and you really can use it to point and shoot or take full control yourself. I have taken some amazing shots with this camera. I recommend getting the DVD that describes all of the camera's functions in more depth. It was a great way to learn the camera.

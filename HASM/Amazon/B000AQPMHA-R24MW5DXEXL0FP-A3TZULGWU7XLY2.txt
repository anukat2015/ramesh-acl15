Title: Love my Keurig
Content:
This makes the best cup of coffee, always perfectly brewed and fresh tasting.  Mine is going strong after 2 years of use.  You can run it without a k-cup and get hot water for tea or hot chocolate.  I often run my k-cups through twice but this works best with the darker blends.  My favorite is the Kenya AAA.  It would be nice to be able to choose a larger cup quantity but as I said I just run it through twice for a bigger cup.  You can purchase an empty k-cup holder and run through your favorite coffee but this is not practical for the long term in my opinion because I don't like having to clean and wash the holder.
This would make any coffee lover a great Christmas or birthday gift.

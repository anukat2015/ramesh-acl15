Title: Weak heat, but strong plastic smell
Content:
This heater doesn't draw much power, but it also doesn't put out much heat, and because it's blowing at you via fan it feels even cooler.  It also emits a burning plastic smell.  To get rid of the smell, I put it on the balcony and let it run several hours, but that did not entirely clear up the problem.  This was an expensive mistake.  I give it two stars as it does seem well made, and since others seem satisfied maybe I was just unlucky and happened to get a faulty unit.

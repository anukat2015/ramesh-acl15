Title: Excellent heater for my bedroom.
Content:
I got tired of $200 a month heating bills.  I mearly wanted to heat my bedroom in the mornings and sometimes at night.  This heater is perfect!  With the remote I can turn the heater off and on from my bed.  The ease of use and how it reflected on my heating bill is tremndous.  I love the remote.  I am partially disabled, so getting in and out of bed to adjust the heater can be trying at times.  Yes, it might sound like the height of laziness but it is the best fit for me.  I have a large dog and a cat and the animals do not topple the heater at all.  It has a great base and the oscillating feature warms the entire room just right.

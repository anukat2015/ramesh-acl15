Title: No Cons Whatsoever
Content:
I agree with all the pros that others have listed.  As for the MicroSD slot, just cover it up with scotch tape if you aren't using it.
I had to get a JBuds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones with Travel Case (Jet Black) since my ears are too big, but its included earphone sounds much better than my old (Sony and other) headphones.

Title: If you want HEAT buy this heater
Content:
Wanted to suppliment our old baseboard heaters in our basement and looked around at brands.  Delongi seemed reputible and we had an old oil filled radiator we used that worked well so we tried a couple.  Got the retro model and the safe heat one was back ordered.  The retro model was fantastic and warmed our large baement real well.  Couldnt wait to see how well the other one works.  Other one finally came but I didnt mind the wait since it was summer.  Well let me tell you - it put another model of radiater from Honeywell that I had found on clearance at Home Depot to shame.  The Delongi Safe Heat Dragon warmed our huge family room and the other did not warm a small bed room - maybe I can return the other to Home Depot!
If you want HEAT - buy this model - it is great for the size.  I was amazed!!

Title: Needed An Upgrade
Content:
I recently purchased another Apple Ipod (80 Gig Model) due to the fact that I was using up the memory up on my 30 gig Ipod quick.  Plus the headphone jack was loosening up as well ( sound coming out of one side ). I' ve owned it for 3 years.
When it came time for an upgrade,  I read some reviews in Amazon and didn't know what the negative comments were all about.  My new 80 gig Ipod works just fine and does what is expected.  Nothing more, nothing less. Plus is has new features that leave my 5th generation Ipod in the dust.  Great job again Apple.

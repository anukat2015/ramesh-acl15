Title: Cute and efficient for a great price
Content:
The pretty color caught my eye first.  I am sooooo tired of black, white and stainless steel.  The second thing I noted was the
simplicity of operation.  We are simple folk.  We don't really need
or want all the bell's and whistles that are often added.  We just
want to pour water in one end and get coffee out of the other end.
Included is a reusable filter basket.  You do have to remember to 
turn it off after pouring your last cup--it does not turn off by
itself.  I like the transparent water reservoire and the snug fit
of the pot to the drip spout--less splatter.  Add to that a great
price and the fun of having an Italian import 8-).  Fast shipping
and a friendly company to deal with.  What's not to like?

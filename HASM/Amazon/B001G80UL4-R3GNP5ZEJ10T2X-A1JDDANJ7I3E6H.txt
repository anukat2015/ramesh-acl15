Title: This heater is worthless!
Content:
I purchased this model of heater in November 2008.  It worked nicely for a couple of months.  Then it just stopped completely.  I contacted SoleousAir customer service, and they sent me a replacement which I finally received in April 2009 (end of the heating season of course).  This unit did not work out of the box.  They had me return this one, and I had to call and remind them in October of 2009 that they still owed me a heater and heating season was coming up.  I promptly received a third new unit in early October, which didn't get used until November.  By the end of December, this unit is no longer functional.  It turns off after only a few minutes of heating as if it is overheated.  I called SoleusAir customer service again, and although the people are very nice, I was politely told that the 1 year warranty is only valid from the date of original purchase, and not from when the last functional unit was received.  So, if they throw enough junk units at you to uncomfortably get through 1 year, they are off the hook and you no longer have a heater that works.  DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER!

Title: Coffee Drinker's Little Buddy
Content:
Just skimming other reviews I know I an not alone in my caffeine situation I am the only one in my houselhold that drinks coffee. When I lived alone amd before I received a one cup coffee maker I would either drink too much coffee at once or throw ou a good portion of the pot.
Finally (I hear almost a collective gasp from my fellow{ess} caffiene drinkers} some innovative thinkers came up with a one cup of coffee machine. The coffee this machine makes either its own brand or after stuffing some Folgers and Maxwell House pods in it other brands is quite good. Not quite as strong as my tastes go, but that is largely due to I have coffee cups twice the size of what the machine was designed for, so it is not totally to blame.
This is a convenient simple way to make a cup of coffee in approximately a minute perfect for a cup on the fly. My only real critiqu that is seperate from issues I have getting my oversize mug full is iut could perhaps be a little quieter.
Anyhow a great invention that I have and will continue to praise loudly as I run around all hopped up on caffeine while I wonder "A pod coffee system, what will they think of next? Sending a man to the moon? Oh yeah that's beem done".*
*** I no longer want to hear anyone complain about they can send a man to the moon but they can't brew a cup of coffee maker not that that was a daily overheard complaint.

Content:
I purchased this heater as a Christmas gift for my father.  He needed to heat a small room in an outdoor building.  He telephoned me 3 days after Chrsitmas to tell me that the heater barely put out any heat.  Embarrased, I gave him $$ I had paid for the heater so that he could purchase something that would work, and brought the heater back to my house.  This heater is terrible.  It does heat if you are standing right on top of it, but it ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT heat a room of any size - - I have even tried putting it in my bathroom.  It is great to place right in front of my dog's bed to keep him warm, but that is all.  In fact, it heats so little that I have now placed it under my desk, on hi all of the time, to keep my feet warm.  It never gets too hot, but it does keep my feet warm.  It looks really nice, but does not work. I am very diappointned that I purchased this product, and would never recommend or purchase again.

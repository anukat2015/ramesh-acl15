Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
I have been very happy with my coffee maker. No plastic taste here. I LOVE the on demand feature. You can set how long you want the coffee to stay hot and it does stay hot. Easy easy to clean. The only drawback is that that resevior is not easy squeezy to fill, takes a steady hand.

Title: Apple hits a home run with the late 2008 MacBook Pro!
Content:
The new MacBook Pro is a significant new laptop, aka MBP, Apple's new unibody manufacturing makes the MBP solid. Just holding the MBP you can feel the quality. And this is just my external impression.
Looking inside the MBP you'll be pleased, from the wonderful, full sized back lit keyboard, the super drive, the array of ports, the connecting options, and the new screen. I love the new glossy screen, the colors are so vibrant, the best display screen I have seen on a laptop.
Perhaps the best thing about the new MBP. Is the software. Staring with Mac OSX, the operating system, clearly the best operating system available. And not just my opinion check out what the industry pundits have to say about OSX. Also included is Apple's well received creative programs, iTunes, iPhoto, and others.
I feel in love with Apple products, after many years of struggling with Windows, just try out the new MBP.  I have a feeling you'll love the experience.

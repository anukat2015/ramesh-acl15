Title: Very good coffee maker.  Some thoughts.
Content:
I have been using the coffee maker for many weeks and have a few thoughts that I would like to share.  First of all, since there is no warming plate, and there can't be, it is crucial to take the coffee mug out when the coffee finishes going through the filter.  The mug is open with no top and cools quickly.
Secondly, I decided to get a unit like this when the water drought and shortage in the SouthEast (NC) became severe.  Previously, I had been using a 4 cup drip coffee maker.  I realized that cleaning the pot every morning took water that could be used elsewhere or for the environment.  With this coffee maker, I am saving water.  Maybe not more than three quarters of a gallon a day, but every bit helps.
Third, using a regular filter means that I am not stuck with using pods or making my own or having to clean a filter kit.  Yes, paper filters take landfill space, but they degrade nicely and the water situation is  more critical (for the moment!).
Fourth, This coffee maker does seem to force me into a specific mug, or at least with the same size, with and bottom diameter.  With this coffee maker, the bottom and top diameters are critical, unless one uses a very wide mouthed mug and can get it to fit underneath.
Lastly, and I did save this for last.  I don't think that the coffee tastes that good.  Maybe its because the mug size is 14.5 oz and I don't have the measurements down yet.  I'll have to experiment and see if I can do better.  It does brew properly, but there are no additional  side holes - there can't be - that I have seen in other upper end coffee makers.

Title: waste of money
Content:
i wish I was able to give this a 1/2 star, this is the most worthless coffee maker I have ever bought.  You end up spilling coffee 90% of the time when you try to get it in your cup.  Found you have to lift the lid just a little and then pour.  The burner does not seem to keep the coffee very hot at all, I usually have to microwave it for a little bit to get it to the right temp.  I would not waste my money, very disappointed considering that its a Bunn.

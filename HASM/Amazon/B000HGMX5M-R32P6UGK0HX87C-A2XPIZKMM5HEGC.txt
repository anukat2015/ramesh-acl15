Title: Lovin' it
Content:
Great camera and lens. Took it on a trip to Chile -- lots of shots of mountains, architecture and little kids. The photos look great, the camera was easy to use without any previous instruction, and a 2MB card and one battery lasted me almost the entire 2.5 week trip (got about 800 photos on one card and then switched it out; battery is still good to go).

Title: The D300 is worth upgrading from a D80 for
Content:
I upgraded from a D80 and definitely think the D300 is worth the upgrade.  It some aspects it's night and day.  The image quality in ideal situations might not be that different, but the HIGH ISO performance of the D300 is much better and the 6/FPS of the D300 make it entirely useful for action/sports/nature shots.  That is the main reason I upgraded, the D80's 3/FPS were not enough.
Then there is the far, far superior auto-focus system on the D300.  The D300 focuses my Nikkor AF ED 80-200mm F2.8D lens faster than the D80 did making me not feel the need to upgrade to an AF-S lens in that zoom range.  
The build quality of the D300 is far superior to the D80 and the extra buttons and their placement make it a much more efficient camera to use, that is if you are constantly switching between AF-C and AF-S focus as well as single point and multi-point focus.  No annoying exposure dial to get accidentally moved while in your bag anymore either (sometimes on my D80 it would get accidentally moved from A-priority to M-priority and I wouldn't notice and my first few shots would just be white).  
Then there is the fact that the D300 uses compact flash cards which are more reliable than SDHC cards and far, far easier to handle as they are large and don't have exposed contact points.  
Then there is the other fact the D300's built-in flash can act as a commander to fire an off camera flash (like the SB-600/800/900) which is extremely useful and makes for infinite more flash opportunities right out of the box.
Also, if you find the D80's LCD screen when reviewing shots to have lag when moving around and zooming into the photo, that is all gone in the D300.  That was one thing that really annoyed me about the D80, that lag.  With the D300, the lag is almost imperceptible, not to mention you get a larger and better 3" screen for reviewing shots on.
Another D300 feature I like is "Active D-lighting."  I use this feature often when shooting subjects that are backlit or in shadow.

Title: Works great for me!
Content:
I'm a long time Canon user and have always appreciated how easy Canon camera's worked as well as the quality of the pictures taken. I purchased this eos rebel XTi before going on a family vacation and with the expectation of a future visit overseas.  I wanted to have good quality pictures to remember each by.  Also, I have a 17 year old Canon 650 film camera with extra lenses and flash that also fit and work just fine with the new xti.  You've got to love that about a camera almost 20 years later!  I've taken approximately 500 pictures since this has arrived and find the quality what I expected and hoped for - excellent.  Though I'm still learning how to use all of it's features - I would highly recommend the canon eos XTi to anyone short of the professional with lots of extra money!

Title: Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Programmable Really is 4 Cups
Content:
I've had this little machine for several weeks now. We use it for decaf. I've had no problem with clock function or anything else. Others have mentioned that it's not truly a "4-cup" coffee maker, but I'd like to point out that the standard "cup" of coffee is generally 6 ounces, not 8, and thus the carafe is a 4-cupper. (Check instructions on coffee packaging -- they usually recommend a tablespoon or so per 6 ounces of water, which reflects the standard.) A feature I like is that it turns itself off after an hour in case I forget and spares me the burned coffee taste. I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a thermal carafe. But all in all, a handy, space-saving machine that's value-priced and makes a good cup of coffee.

Title: Love it!
Content:
I have had nothing but Gateway desktop pc's. This my first laptop and very happy with Gatweway NV5921u! Fast,quiet and very cool running! The blue cover looks awesome with the alligator motif! The touchpad has the multi-gesture feature! I have to get used to it but neat feature! The blu-ray player is nice feature and will output to HDTV. Time will tell how she holds up but I think this baby will keep on rockin! 
The only downside might be battery life--about 3 hours-but that is about average I understand.--the blu-ray player really sucks the power BTW! Did I mention how "Light" she is! Way more portable than a 17 inch laptop! The 15 inch screen might be smallish compared to a 17 incher but fine for me! A Webcam is included as well. Grab one now!

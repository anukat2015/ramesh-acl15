Title: Great Product for What it Does
Content:
I just received my new 3g Nano. It is a great product, but for a specific purpose. It certainly will not replace the full size Nano or my Archos 604 for regular viewing. The screen is just too small. However, the quality of the image is outstanding. In my opinion, this product will please those wanting a tiny Ipod, very suitable for listening to music and great for watching a short video, say, while waiting for your spouse in the mall. After an hour or so, my eyes began squinting, looking at the tiny image. It may be ideal for a short flight, but certainly not for a cross country flight. Installing the music is the same as any other Ipod, using Itunes. So far, it functions flawlessly. If you plan to use this unit primarily for transporting videos for watching on a TV, this unit will also do the job. Images on a Tv are equal to those from the full size Ipod.

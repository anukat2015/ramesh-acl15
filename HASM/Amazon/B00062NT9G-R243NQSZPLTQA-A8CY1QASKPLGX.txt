Title: Extended lens life
Content:
Owning a Pentax SFX SLR with multiple zoom lens, fixed lens, Super Flash, filters and various additional attachments, going to the *ist was a no brainer. Now I can travel with the best of both worlds and use much of the fine equipment collected over the years. I can say the 'old' film camera lens and flash works with the 'new' digital camera with nary a hitch. I can carry a single battery source for both cameras. Photos come out as expected. Pentax steady preditable quality continues.

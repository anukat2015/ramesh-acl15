Title: The best
Content:
This is the best coffee maker ever!  We were looking for a non carafe style coffee maker.  The only options were machines that use 'pods.'  We didn't want to be chained to purchasing pods the rest of our lives.  We found the cuisinart coffee on demand, bought it, and love it.  Just unbelievable.  Great hot coffee.  Easy clean-up.  Uses standard #4 filters and your favorite ground.  NO NO PODS=great!

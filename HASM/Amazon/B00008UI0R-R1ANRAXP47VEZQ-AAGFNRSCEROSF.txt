Title: Excellent canister vacuum!
Content:
This is a great vacuum for people with a lot of pet hair.  If not for the "bagless" feature, I would need to use a new bag with each use.  Suction is great!  The variable suction feature works well if you use throw rugs.  Easy to push and pull.  The washable hepa filter is easy to clean, however it seems to need cleaning more than I thought it would.  The only thing that bothers me is that it doesn't seem to follow along very well.  Don't know if it is top heavy or what, but it seems to tip over too often.  Basically, I am very happy with this product.

Title: This camera just feels good...
Content:
I bought the camera refurbished from Cameta Camera 2 weeks ago and I really like it. It feels great in your hand, even better than the new D90 to me. I also have a Canon XSi which feels great in the hand too. I like the controls on the D80 better. It is more of a shooters camera than the Canon. I think they are both great cameras. 
All the pros and cons have been listed in prior reviews. Check out the D80 review at dpreview for all the details. The only feature on the D80 that I probably need to check on is the compressed NEF raw file format. The camera saves RAW files in a compressed format, although the details are sketchy. Nikon claims it is lossless process. I usually shoot large JPEGs with low compression - but I will update this review after I try opening some RAW shots in both Bibble & PSE to compare the results.

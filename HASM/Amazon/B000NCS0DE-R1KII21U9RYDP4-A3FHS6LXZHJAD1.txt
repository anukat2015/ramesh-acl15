Title: Great suction but...
Content:
This little machine has great suction but is limited in flexibility - hard-to-reach areas are difficult. The attachments are so-so. The brush barely picks up at all. The flat tool has great suction but could have a wider surface area. Still, it will go where your big vac won't and it's not too heavy.

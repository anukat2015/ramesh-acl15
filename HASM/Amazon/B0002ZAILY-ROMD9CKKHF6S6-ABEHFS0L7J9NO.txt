Title: Happy Commuter
Content:
I enjoy the commute to work now that I have my iPod Shuffle and an FM adaptor/tuner. Let's just say that I'm not a fan of the local radio stations morning shows. Both the iPod and the tuner together were less expensive than the "fancy" iPods and if I lose these I won't cry nearly as hard. Knock on wood. 
It doesn't bother me in the slightest that there isn't a display because I use the iPod in my vehicle. I figure the last thing people need is another distraction while driving. I can get it ready in the driveway and never touch it again until I store the chewing gum sized iPod anywhere. It's so small!
One negative is that the shuffle setting isn't random, and resets itself to the beginning each day. But the regular play setting saves where I was in the playlist and with over fifteen hours of songs I don't have to hear the same song for weeks.
I'd give the product a five, but... The downloads I buy are not compatible, and I refuse to be price gouged on the iTunes website. So I started buying more CDs after I got the iPod.

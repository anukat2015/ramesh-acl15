Title: Great vacuum for great price!!!!!
Content:
I started with an Electrolux over 30 years ago and moved on to Rainbow about 15 years ago.  My first Rainbow was wonderful and I finally traded it in for a new Rainbow 5 years ago.  It is a piece of junk!  It is totally falling apart and there are no service centers in my current area.  It's very heavy and cumbersome and not easily maneuvered.  So I set out to find a new vacuum that wouldn't cost me a year's wages and would be easy to handle.  I searched Amazon and read all the reviews and settled on this Panasonic.  It arrived and I had it out of the box and put together in 10 minutes.  It's surprisingly lightweight, but sturdy and it has substance.  The 360 degree swivel is marvelous and makes a huge difference in maneuvering.  I used to have to wear "shoes" to vacuum in or the Rainbow would kill my toes and smash my feet.  This Panasonic is so easy to handle and so much lighter that I can wear my flip flops and not kill my toes.  The attachments are contained in the body of the vacuum and that's so handy.  The electrical cord is self winding...again, this beats Rainbow all out.  The power nozzle is marvelous, and guess what?  It is 100 times quieter than a Rainbow...my dogs did not run for the hills when I turned it on.  OMG!  I should have dumped the Rainbow a long time ago, especially when you compare pricing.  I have 3 dogs and I vacuum a lot so even if this vacuum doesn't last more than a year or two, it is still more cost effective than a overpriced Rainbow.  I highly recommend this Panasonic and I am so glad I purchased it.  Now I don't dread vacuuming the way I used to.  Happy cleaning!

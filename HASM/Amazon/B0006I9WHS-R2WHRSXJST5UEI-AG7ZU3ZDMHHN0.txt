Title: A Ceramic Heater that Actually WORKS! (see review, though)
Content:
I have 3 of the Honeywell HZ-315 heaters; one has been used daily for 3 fall/winter/spring seasons, and the other 2 for one fall/winter (so far) in Colorado. All have performed perfectly. 
*** UPDATE (March 2009): One of these heaters that I bought in early fall 2008 lasted through fall and almost all of winter, but crapped-out in early March. It must have a defective component because it now shuts down after only a few seconds running - and at any setting. So, my 4 star rating is now only 3 (but Amazon won't let me change it!). Assuming I just happened to get one defective unit I will replace it with another HZ-315. Yes, I like this heater enough to take a chance on another one! ***
Pros: Inexpensive, efficient, reliable, compact, simple design, 1500 watts of heat.
Cons (minor): No handle to grab to move it around, and heat control dial is on the lower front of the unit - an inconvenient location.
The BEST thing about this model ceramic heater is that it has a serious ~5-inch fan in the back that draws air through the heating element and literally PUSHES it out the front, which makes it VERY efficient! It heats a small bedroom pretty fast and it's just perfect for a home office.

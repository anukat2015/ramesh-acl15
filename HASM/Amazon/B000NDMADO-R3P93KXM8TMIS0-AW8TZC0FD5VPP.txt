Title: Dyson DC21 Stowaway
Content:
I just purchased the DC21 Stowaway and am not as impressed as I thought I'd be. I have a 5 yr. old Riccar canister (supralite plus) which cost me south of $200 and with a fresh bag this little monster creates much more suction power than the Dyson.  The negatives about the Riccar are fewer tools to do a variety of jobs, and having to replace bags. On the plus side it is far lighter and smaller than the Dyson making it easy to move around for cleaning all over the house. The Dyson DC21 has better tools, but the large molded end of the hose which accepts all the tools is so big that it is hard to get into tight spaces when using it without tools. The wood floor tool is great actually for brushing/vacuuming off my microfiber couch which collects cat hair like a magnet. 
So far the jury's still out on whether I keep this vacuum. I was expecting more for a vacuum over $400.
Pro's: 1) tool functionality 2) no need to change bags 3) telescoping handle
Con's: 1) weight 2) price 3) large diameter of tool housing at end of hose 3) less suction than even my meager Riccar canister 4) small round brush tool doesn't lock into place, and keeps falling off while in use
EDIT 6/15/07- I did in fact return the Stowaway because of mentioned flaws. I have purchased several new tools for my Riccar canister and could not see enought positives to keep the Dyson. I had the chance to try one of their full uprights that my brother & his wife have, and it indeed has a ton more suction power than this Stowaway cansiter. Unfortunately my impression of Dyson is now tarnished. 
I think I would even reduce the number of stars to 2.5.....

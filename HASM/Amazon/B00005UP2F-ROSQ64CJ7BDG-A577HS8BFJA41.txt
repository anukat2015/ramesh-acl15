Title: nice compromise
Content:
in my dreams i would like to purchase a super duper ... vacuum, but of course at this point, that is not possible.  this vacuum is a nice compromise between the low end models and the fancy pants ones. i agree with the reviewer who mentioned that cleaning the filter is messy,but that is the only complaint i have regarding this machine.  it's easy to move around and the attachments ROCK - i did everything from lampshades to blinds to mouldings.  i am very happy with this purchase!

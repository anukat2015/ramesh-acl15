Title: All five stars. Terrific vacuum.
Content:
I have owned many vacuums & many hoover vacs. This has been the best by far. It has strong adjustable power, no bags, lightweight & the right attachments. It exceeded my expectations. I only hope that it will last a long time. I use my vacuum several times a day because I have many pets including messy birds that toss their seeds & it isn't a chore taking out this vacuum even for the smallest jobs.

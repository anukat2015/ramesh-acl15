Title: Not Worth the Money
Content:
Died in exactly one year. This wouldn't be as annoying if it wasn't for the fact that Vornado is priced significantly higher than it's competition. Compact design and good proof of concept. It circulates air fairly well, but middling build quality. In fairness, I've gotten more use out of their fans but for space heaters you might want to look elsewhere.

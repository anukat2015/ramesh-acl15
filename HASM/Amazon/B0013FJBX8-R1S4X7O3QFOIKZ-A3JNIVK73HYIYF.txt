Title: 3 stars just because is not preloaded with ilife 09
Content:
The new macbook pro for my opinion it's one of the best laptops around. I'm no t going to be so specific about this wonderful notebook because other reviewers made a good job reviewing it. I just want to say that i don't give 5 stars to this magnific electronic piece just for the dissapointing issue that at this price this 15 inch macbook pro it's not preloaded with ilife '09 as Imacs do. Even the white macbook ($1300 less) comes preloaded with ilife '09. I have to spend about $60 more if i want to enjoy Ilife '09. We paid a lot more of cash and we have to pay more if we want to see running this software on our notebooks. Is not fair. I think we have the right to expect at least a free upgrade from Apple or Amazon. Don't know if i'm missing something or if i'm wrong but i just insist that is not fair.

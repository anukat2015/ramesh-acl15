Title: Great for the price mp3 player!
Content:
My almost 11 year old daughter got an mp3 player for Christmas.  Originally we got her an rca one that was a tad bigger and about $10 more expensive.  The RCA must have been a dud, after less then a week the thing was freezing up, soooo slow and the screen was messed up.  SO we took it back and this Philips one had been my first choice, so we decided to give it a whirl.  Soooo much better.  She is very pleased. It is quick, easy to load and the battery life is amazing so far.  As for the 30 day rhapsody trial....when we loaded the software on the computer for some reason it wouldn't let us sign up, kept giving me an error and try to conact customer service...I eventually gave up, we have plenty of music anyways.  Bottom line is that we would buy this one again, its a great starter for the kids...we may end up getting it for our other daughter for her birthday.

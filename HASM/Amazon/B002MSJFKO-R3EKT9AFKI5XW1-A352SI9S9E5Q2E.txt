Title: got this at great price!!!!!!!!
Content:
Just bought this at bed bath and beyond got it for $110 with the $50 rebate and the 20% off coupon that you always get in the mail from them...So for that reason i had to really get it and i just love it...i'm a big starbucks coffee gal and I absolutely love the lattes and cappu. that they offer and it really saves a trip and plus extra cash...Anyways it is really a great machine i personally don't think its hard to use it comes with a filteration system for the water which is great and all the little stuff like filters and coffee pods don't cost that much...Amazon offer a great deal on them or if your like me bed bath and beyond always sends these $5 off $15 purchase coupons and i just pick them up that way too!!!

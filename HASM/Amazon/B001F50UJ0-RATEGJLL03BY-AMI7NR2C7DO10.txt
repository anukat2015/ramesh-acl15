Title: Perfect MP3 and Video Player
Content:
The Walkman E438 does music, FM radio, pictures, and video well. The sound is excellent, the controls are intuitive, and the 2 inch display is dazzling. Plays Amazon unbox-mobile video movies, also has pictures with slide show. Works flawlessly with Windows Media Player and Amazon's MP3 store. For those Apple die hards, it also plays unprotected AAC.
FM radio is a plus when at the gym (tune into what's playing on the tv). 
Small, pocketable. As with any MP3, invest in some good headphones.

Title: Perfect for Singles
Content:
There is something special about perked coffee.  It's not that it's stronger but more FLAVORFUL.  I've lived with drip coffee makers because they are the only type you can find if you only want a single mug of coffee - but I've always complained about the drip process.  This coffee pot is perfect.  It gives me just one mug of flavorful coffee and it is easy to clean to boot!

Title: Nothing new can be said...
Content:
...about the nano. I purchased the nano for a friend.
Let's talk about the shipping. This is the first time Amazon takes so long to ship the product. I admitt I used the free shipping offer and everything was under their terms, however, in previous shipping experiences I had with Amazon, unit arrived no later than 4 days after the purchase is made.
Nothing to complaint about... just a comment.
Price: Amazingly, cheaper than Apple Store and other retailers (Best Buy, Target, etc)

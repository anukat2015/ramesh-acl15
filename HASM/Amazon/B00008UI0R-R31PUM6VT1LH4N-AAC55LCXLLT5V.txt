Title: Handles my houseful beautifully
Content:
I will start by saying that I have six children, a dog, a cat and a ferret and have owned *many* vacuums over the years.
I purchased this vacuum after being profoundly disappointed by my last vacuum, a Eureka Boss Bagless Widetrack which would clog if you so much as looked at it the wrong way.
After reading some glowing reviews of the Hoover Wind Tunnel Cannister Vacuum's ability to handle pet fur and more on a variety of surfaces, I decided to invest but retained some skepticism, after all, I vacuum *a lot*.
It has been a year now and I have been waiting for it to fail me before I submitted my review, but I can honestly say it has not.
I have wooden floors, carpeted floors and vinyl flooring and it powerfully handles them all. I love that all the controls on are the handle and have found to my surprise that the variety of suction levels actually come in handy (my previous thought being that wouldn't you just want a vacuum to suck the most?) - this vacuum can actually be too powerful at times (say when dusting ornament shelving) and if you accidentally suck up a piece of Lego, it whips it straight into the cannister! I have yet to clog this vacuum! A miracle!
The cannister filter washes and dries easily and I am *always* amazed at the amount of filth collected in it (I clean it after every couple of uses). Being a shorty, I also love the easily adjustable handle.
I really don't have anything negative to say about this vacuum - it is by far the best one I have ever owned and worth every penny.

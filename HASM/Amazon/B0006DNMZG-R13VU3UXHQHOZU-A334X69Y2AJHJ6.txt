Title: Loud fan and terrible thermostat
Content:
I bought this from Target a week ago for $30 based on a review in Consumer Reports.  I returned it to Target this morning.  I do not recommend this unit.  Here are the Pros and Cons:
Pros:
* Small
* Inexpensive
Cons:
* Must keep it 3 feet away from everything since it blows hot air in 360 degrees.
* The unit is loud: it kept my 1 year old daughter awake when we had it in her room.
* The thermostat has no hysteresis.  Translated to English: the unit comes on for 15 seconds, then shuts itself off as soon as the temperature in the immediate area goes up by a degree.  Then, after about a minute or two, it comes on again as the temperature drops slightly.  So basically the unit keeps cycling on and off all night.
Bottom line: if you want it for a garage, it's probably ok, but for a bedroom, get something else.

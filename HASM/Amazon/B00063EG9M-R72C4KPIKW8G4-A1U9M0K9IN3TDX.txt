Title: my 2 cents
Content:
Now I had a lyra for a long time (the old 128 mb that used 2 AAA's) up until a few days before this was written when it was stolen, but it worked great! And about the battery thing yeah its pretty cheap but still durable, I dropped it many times to the concrete. And even into water it was not waterproof but was still working. 
1 problem I did have was after a while due to poor soldering the headphone jack died, but I just soldered it back saved the trouble, though I think that was due to it falling in 2 feet of water. But yeah after that experience I have no choice but to get another one.

Title: First impressions
Content:
This review might seem premature, as the Electrolux has been in my possession for less than 24 hours, but the excitement of owning a quality vacuum for the first time in my life warrants the commentary. My wife and I have owned no less than 15 vacuums between us in the past 10 years. The lackluster quality of the $75-200 vacuum market is a running joke in our family. Let's face it, the sub-$300 vacuums are going to lose suction in the first year and parts need replacing even sooner when heavily used. 
Initial analysis and testing of the Electrolux shows nice quality craftmanship for plastic and an elegant, easy-to-use, quickly assembled piece of hardware. Our 7 and 11 year olds are wowed by her beauty, quietness, and the light weight. I'm very happy to report they might even pitch in and help vacuum the larger rugs in the house on a regular basis -- Eureka (no, not the maker of junk cleaners)!!
I plan to re-visit this post in one year's time. It'll be interesting to see how the vacuum holds up to a solid 12 months of rigorous operation in a busy environment -- we have 3 children, 4 cats, and a Maltese-Poodle mix. Yes, this vacuum is a blessing to say the least.

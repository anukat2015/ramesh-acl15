Title: I'm very happy with my Zune
Content:
I like to go against the grain, and I've personally never liked the look of the iPod anyway, so a went with Zune. I had no problems with installation of the software or syncing my music. Operation is so easy it comes with no manual. The interface is super-intuitive and simple to use. The large screen looks great, and the sound is good.
A few cons to the player, none of which are a deal-breaker for me. I don't mind the Zune software, but I prefer using Windows Media Player and I don't see why you can't sync directly from WMP, considering it is nearly identical to the Zune software except for the skin. In addition, the stylish squared edges of the player make it a little less comfortable to hold, so it's not for runners or anyone looking to walk around holding their player constantly. Also there aren't a lot of accessories out there for Zune, but I found a lot of great stuff on Ebay as far as cases and chargers go.
So all in all, I'm very happy with my Zune. It's a simple player, I've never had any problems using it, and IMO its design is a lot more interesting than the iPod, particularly those ugly little dwarf iPod Nanos they just put out.

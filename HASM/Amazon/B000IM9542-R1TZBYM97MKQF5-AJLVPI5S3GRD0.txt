Title: Sansa c250
Content:
This little mp3 is has a long battery life. I use it about 4 hours a day and throughout the whole week i only charge it once or twice and thats it! Although it cant hold a lot of songs, u can buy an addition microSD for it and it could increase the memory.The screen is easily scratched but u can always buy a screen protector or put it in a case. Lastly for all you loud volumers, half way into the volume option its already loud.

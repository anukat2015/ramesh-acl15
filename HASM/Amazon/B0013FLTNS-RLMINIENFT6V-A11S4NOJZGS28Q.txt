Title: Macbook Pro
Content:
I have been using the Macbook Pro for over 2 months now. I find it a delight to use. Stable, fast and a very user friendly keyboard. I installed iWork, MS Office 2008, Fusion 2.0 and Windows XP for general use. I have been working on both my Dell Vista system and my Macbook and find the Macbook more user friendly and stable than the Dell Vista system. Most of the teachers I work with use only Windows and I was concerned that the documents that I produced with iWork or Mac Office would be a problem, but that has not been the case. All have been very easy to open and use. I am using Fusion and Windows XP Pro very little since the programs on the Mac work perfectly. I can even write PowerPoints on the Mac (MS Office 2008) put them on a Flash drive and read them at school on my HP Vista system without any problem. 
I have used Windows for many years and finally got fed up with Vista hanging, crashing and it loading time. I purchased the Mac to get away from Microsoft and have had great success. If it were not for a few problems with Keynote (maybe I will be able to solve them) and converting to PowerPoint I would not be using any Microsoft products! As a long time Windows user, I recommend you switch to a Mac, you will not be sorry.

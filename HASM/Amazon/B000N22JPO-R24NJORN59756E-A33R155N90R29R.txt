Title: Don't break the carafe!!
Content:
I'm sorry, but the complaints about the small hole to fill is very nit-picky. If you take your time and fill the reservoir slowly, it's totally not an issue.  The coffee maker works great on all other levels, but the real problem I have is we broke the carafe not long after we got it (naturally).  Ok, it happens, but can you find a replacement anywhere??  We had a Mr. Coffee before and you can easily replace a broken carafe for a fraction of the cost of the coffee maker.  I can't even find a replacement on Farberware's site.  That brings down the rating as it's inevitbale that someday an accident will happen and the incompatible coffee maker becomes useless.

Title: Good, but beware of broken buttons...
Content:
I got this at costco when it was $799 and it came with a broken backspace button... Didn't return it because the store I went to was too far. Ended up buying an external keyboard for this... Beware! better to build your own gaming rig than this... Also, this runs very HOT!

Title: Fantastic Piece of Machinery
Content:
I've owned this product for 2 years and I would swear by it. Initially, I found out that the heater wouldn't run so long on 1# canisters so I bought the 1803 hose with quick connect and regulator. I connected this to my 20# tank and it just runs and runs until I turn it off. Their website provided me with additional maintenance tips to keep the heater clean and operational, and I have had nothing but positive experiences with their CS and technical personnel. I would recommend this product to everyone.

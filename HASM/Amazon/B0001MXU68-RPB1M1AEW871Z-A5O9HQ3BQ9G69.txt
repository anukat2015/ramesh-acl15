Title: Great system, but finding pods locally? Not so good
Content:
I bought the red Melitta One:One. I LOVED it for about 2 months. Then I started having trouble finding the pods. I bought this at Target, they quit selling the pods, then Linen and Things quit, no grocery store carries them, nothing local.
 So now I have to shop online and wait for them to be delivered, and unless I want to buy a gazillion I have to pay for shipping too.
 I have tried the other pods, they just don't fit as well and I don't think the coffee is a good. So don't be fooled into buying this, unless you can get the pods.

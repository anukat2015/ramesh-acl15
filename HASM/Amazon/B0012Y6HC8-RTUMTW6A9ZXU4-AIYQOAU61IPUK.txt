Title: worth every penny
Content:
I am thrilled with my purchase of the Rebel XSI. This camera has exceeded my expectations. In comparing it with my friend's XTI (previous model in the rebel line) it has many great updates. It is lighter, buttons are places in more ergonomic positions. The lense it comes with is a great starter lense but I will be saving up for other as the 18-55mm while versatile does not meet all my needs. Also, in shopping around Amazon had the best price on this camera hands down and delivery was spot on.
Fantastic entry level product for the hobbyist or part time photographer. Highly recommended.

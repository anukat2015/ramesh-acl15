Title: A M A Z I N G
Content:
Pros: - great pictures, even on AUTO
- kit lens is great for starting out!
- not as big or heavy as prosumer cameras
- awesome camera for those new to photography
- can be used to practice with auto mode/creative auto mode if you are new to SLRs and are more used to point-and-shoots
- VERY affordable! i got the kit for 724 with the 55-250mm lens (from another retailer of course) and for the money, this camera CANNOT be beat (sorry D5000)
- same image sensor as the one in the more expensive prosumer Canon 50D
Cons: - ef-s lens may rack up in your collection and can only be used by aps- cameras such as the rebel series, 50D, etc. (may not be a con, newer models probably will be backward compatible)
- rebel t1i logo looks a little cheesy on the camera
- the kit lens is rather limited once you get more into photography (average in low light settings, low shutter speed, cheap plasticy feel, etc.)
- can only use fast SDHC cards to record movies
As you can see, these cons are not even REALLY cons if you don't care for things like ergonomics, aesthetics, and video-recording (I don't really care either, but this is a CONS section, had to find something lol)
This is an AMAZING camera! It is my second DSLR ever owned and I have not regretted anything. It has changed my perspective on picture-taking and catapulted me into the ever expansive world of photography and I can never go back to using point-and-shoot cameras (canon sd1000 and canon sx200 were my loves...).
The first cameras I have used is a Nikon D40 and Nikon D3000 from photography classes and they were great starters, but the T1i still outperforms either of them.  My first camera is a used Rebel XTi that I also love, but the color body, scratches, and just overall feel have become just too dated for me.  I had rented a Canon 50D from a local shop and while it may or may not be slightly better than the T1i, the size of the thing is too big and bulky compared. Plus, the difference in price can buy another zoom or prime lens with your T1i!
Speaking of which, after playing with the 18-55 kit lets and familiarizing yourself, try out a prime lens. I highly recommend the 50mm 1.8 (~$90) or the 50mm 1.4 (~$300). You will be shocked to see what this camera can do with such lightning-fast lenses! I have a 50mm 1.4 mounted and have not put the 18-55 back on ever since my purchase back in early November

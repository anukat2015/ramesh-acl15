Title: Very good for the cost
Content:
I like this notebook very much!  For it's price, it can hardly be beat.  Mine came with 1 GB of RAM and a 100 GB hard drive.
I reconfigured it with a higher level operating system and my own software choices, and the higher end stuff I'm running works great.
The screen is simply wonderful--full, bright, vibrant colors and wider than my own desktop.
The keybord takes a little getting used to, at first I kept hitting the caps lock key for the letter "a".  The keyboard isn't laid out wrong, rather it's different from what I'm used to.

Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This is a great vacuum. Its lightweight and has a lot of suction.  The cord is short, but I think its worth the money.  I have only used it on hardwood, but if you need a vacuum that isn't heavy (like for carrying up stairs) this is perfect.  The metal part on the hose is extendable and can be shortened for less storage. I haven't had to replace any parts so I don't know about that department.

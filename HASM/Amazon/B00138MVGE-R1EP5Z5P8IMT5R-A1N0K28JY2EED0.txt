Title: Great Camera
Content:
After reading all the reviews I could find with pros and cons, I just purchased the sony a350, and am very pleased on its performance. The view finder is great (Some reviews said it was too small) I wear glasses and no problem. The color quality is very good, the camera in a nut shell just works great, reguardless of some less than favorable reviews. I have been doing photography for quite awhile, and I just like it ! Besides the camera alone, no matter what kind it is cannot take a great picture, its always the person behind it. So if you want it, like it, then buy it. Also remember Sony has been in the camera business for a while, (Movie cameras, etc. )So they know a little about good color.

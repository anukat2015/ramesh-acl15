Title: This thing is like a Russian Hooker
Content:
It beautiful. . .its sexy. . . but in the morning you are going to wake up with a rash.  Don't let the good looks fool you this is one of the worst portable air conditioners on the market.  This is the third and last time I give DeLonghi a chance.  I have bought and returned 3 different portable air conditioners from them.  They all stink.

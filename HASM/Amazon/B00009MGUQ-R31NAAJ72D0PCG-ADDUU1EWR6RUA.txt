Title: Closes Programs Automatically for No Reason
Content:
The v505bx randomly closes windows such as the web browser, Outlook, control panel window, etc. I'd be working on something and it would just close.  No error messages or anything.So, I took it back to Circuit City with no problems.  They were out of stock on another one.  So, I went to Best Buy and purchased one with the exact same problem.  The problems started before I installed anything or connected to the internet.  Best Buy charged a 15% restocking fee which I am trying to fight.  But, until Sony gets this worked out, I would stay away from this computer.

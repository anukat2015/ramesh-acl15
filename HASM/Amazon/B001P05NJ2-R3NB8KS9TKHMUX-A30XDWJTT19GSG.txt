Title: current student/former PC user
Content:
I've used my 15" MBP for a few months now and these are some of my observations:
Good:
-Sturdy design
-Keyboard 
-runs quiet/cool
-magnetic latch system
-Fast processor
-Display (in some conditions)
-lightweight/form factor
-charging cable
-touchpad
Bad:
-2 usb ports - really?
-battery life is OK
-glossy screen can get annoying in some conditions
Overall, I really like this laptop, but I gave it 4 stars b/c of two main issues. One is that it only has 2 usb ports. Ultraportable 7" laptops even have more usb ports than that. And the second is the glossy screen. 80% of the time I enjoy it - but the other 20% of the time when I'm in the library, the glossy screen actually causes more eye strain and fatigue (my experience). I think on some aspects of this laptop, apple chose form over function - and it hindered the product.

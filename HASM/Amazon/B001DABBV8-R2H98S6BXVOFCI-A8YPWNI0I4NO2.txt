Title: Great Netbook, But minor issues
Content:
I bought the Blue Acer Aspire One (XP version with 120 gigabyte HD) just as soon as one was available.  Did not buy it from Amazon because the price was higher than a local retailer (Micro Center).  Micro Center has dropped the price to the Acer suggested retail price of $349 (XP).  I did see the Linux Version at Circuit City for $307.  So far no real complaints except that the touch pad is difficult to work with and it is not very precise.  Actually the buttons are awkward to use and it often "double-clicks" seemingly on it's own.  I use a mouse now.  So far I have not needed a DVD player since I usually rip my DVDs "for my own use" and load them via the USB port on a Jump Drive or use my card reader.  I purchased a home version of MS Office and simply entered the code. No need for the DVD just the code and it worked seamlessly.    As noted the exterior is very prone to smudges and I find myself cleaning the unit regularly.  I did note that the fan noise is a little loud when used in a quiet room but at coffee shops and other WIFI hotspots it is not noticeable.  Again no real gripes and for the price it does what I was hoping for, a small websurfer with the capability of performing more complex tasks if needed.  I purchased it for the price of a good PDA and it surfs the web better than my iPod Touch.  Its a winner in my book...

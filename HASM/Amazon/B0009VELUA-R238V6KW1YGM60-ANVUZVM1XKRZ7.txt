Title: I love my coffee maker
Content:
Until I got this coffee maker my husband and I would always battle eachother about the coffee pots. I enjoy coffee my husband is an addict. He can never wait till the coffee is done brewing before he gets a cup. The "stop dripping when you remove the carafe" coffee makers are just a bunch of hooey. I would get coffee spilled on my counter all the time. Not a problem with this product. Plus it makes a great cup of coffee. The only thing I would change is the size of the opening you use to fill the pot with water. I do have a problem with spilling water on the outside of the pot. (especially at 5:00am.) Other than that, I wouldn't part with my coffeemaker. Whenever this one decides to go to coffee heaven I will DEFINATELY get another one.

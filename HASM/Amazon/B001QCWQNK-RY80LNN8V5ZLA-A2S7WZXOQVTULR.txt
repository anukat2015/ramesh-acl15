Title: Great upgrade for me
Content:
My first Mac purchase was the first Black Intel MacBook model ever made. I bought it used and have had it for just over a year. I've loved it, but grew tired of the Intel GMA 950 graphics chip fast and wanted the NVIDIA based MacBook in a bad way.
My old MacBook would spin it's fans up at the drop of a hat: screensaver, webcam, flash videos (though Flash on Mac is pretty much poor regardless of your MacBook model. Thanks Adobe). This new MacBook is much quieter and has very noticeably smoother graphics rendering.
At first I was torn between buying the unibody (aluminum) and the white (polycarbonate) models. However, the white MacBook has left me with no regrets. I even bought a second one several days later for my wife.
On May 25th 2009, Apple slightly bumped up the specs on the white MacBook. The updates were negligible for me, so at $894.00, this has been a great deal. 
In regard to the May 25th update to the white MacBook (MB881LL/A vs MC240LL/A):
You'll never notice the difference between 2.0GHz and 2.13GHz or 667MHz and 800MHz RAM in day to day use. The hard drive difference is also small, 120GB vs 160GB. If the 40GB difference is an issue, I've got news for you, you'll need a much larger drive anyways. Forty gigabytes won't go very far for very long these days; unless you plan to time travel back to 2004 or so. My wife and I deal with lots of media, so I immediately replaced the 120GB drives with a 320GB replacements. A 120GB/160GB drive will suit most people just fine.

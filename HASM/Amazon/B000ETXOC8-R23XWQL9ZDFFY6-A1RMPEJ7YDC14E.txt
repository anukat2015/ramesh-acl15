Title: pleasantly surprised
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my husband. I had a friend who bought an mp3 player (not this one!) online, and got burned. I am not very technically savvy so I was not sure what I was getting into. When I told my husband how much I had spent on this, he wasn't expecting anything more than the basics. Let's just say he was pleasantly surprised. This model does as much as the more expensive counterparts, sounds good, and is easy to use.

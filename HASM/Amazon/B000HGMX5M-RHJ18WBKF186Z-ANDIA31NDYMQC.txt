Oh yeah! This is one sweet SLR. As a long-time SLR user switched to digital about 6 years ago I have owned 6 previous digital cameras and find number 7 to be the best in many ways. Ten point two megapixels at high speed with instant startup, Accurate Colors, Great Resolution, Nice Features and Settings, Rugged Case, Intuitive menus, and Easy to learn features make this a photog-addict's dream. Oh, did I mention affordable? Sure we have seen some pretty awesome DSLRs out there but cost has been prohibitive, until now.

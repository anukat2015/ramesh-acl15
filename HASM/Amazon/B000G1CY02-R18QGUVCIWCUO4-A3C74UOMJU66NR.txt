Title: It's true. It shoots sparks.
Content:
I loved this heater. It's a great looking design and blends well with modern surroundings. It worked fine for the first winter, then stored it in the original box for the summer. We got about 4 months out of it this year, it's second winter. It worked pretty well heating a large open room, comfortable anyway. During it's decline, it increased the popping noises during heating and eventually created a glowing lava-like hole about 1 1/2" in diameter. I thought I saw sparks from that spot -- probably should have retired it at that point. It was confirmed a few days later when my husband and I both wheeled around and caught it shooting sparks about two feet from the unit. We also have a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, purchased at the same time, it's currently operational. Another reviewer made a comment about how the oil-filled radiators retain their heat after you turn them off, which is a great point for energy savings.
I'm very research-intensive with everything I purchase. I look for well designed functional products. I've noticed recently that even well respected brands and products rarely reach above average reviews. It's disturbing that electronics seem to have a 1-4 year lifespan without options for affordable service or parts. We better get really good at recycling or put more thought into modular designed products with upgradable parts.

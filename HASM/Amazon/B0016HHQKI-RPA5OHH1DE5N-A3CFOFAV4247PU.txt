Title: stopped working
Content:
"You purchased this item on May 31, 2009".  It quit working a couple days after thanksgiving.  so, it worked about 6 months.
It's very attractive.  It makes great coffee.
One day it simply stopped working.  you can reset the time and alarm.  the light comes on, but nothing else happens.  my unit says it was manufactured in China.

Title: don't buy it
Content:
AT first use I loved this hoover easy to pick up and do stairs etc and picked up dust etc wonderfully. Then after a short while I found it didn't. 
I think the problem is the filter which is supposed to be washable. But it gets clogged up after one room and running it under the tap (what you are supposed to do) doesn't cut it. I scrub it (even in amongst the pleats and leave it to dry which takes a long time and when it is dry you can still see its not clean). When I put it back in, the light flashes that the canister needs emptied (it doesn't) and it just doesn't pick up and you can smell more dust after hoovering than before! (obviously once the dust gets to the filter it returns to the floor.)
The canister needs emptying after each room. And is very dusty when emptying!
Also after changing attachments I found when going back to the original one that it was 'loose' and would only work when vacuuming backwards.
I had an upright hoover bagged windtunnel before which I loved and only got this one as I thought I could save money on bags. But now it has cost me as I now have to go any buy another vacuum!

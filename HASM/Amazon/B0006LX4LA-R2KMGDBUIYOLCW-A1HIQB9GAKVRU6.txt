Title: The little coffee maker that couldn't
Content:
It is cute, but it spills and it's defective. The water spills while trying to fill the maker. The coffee spills when trying to fill the cup. The so-called plate warmer is more of a burner. It doesn't keep the coffee warm as much as it burns it if you don't use it in 15 minutes. But now, after only four months, it doesn't work at all. The automatic timer turns the machine off after 3 seconds and that's being generous. Don't buy it for yourself... Don't buy it as a gift...

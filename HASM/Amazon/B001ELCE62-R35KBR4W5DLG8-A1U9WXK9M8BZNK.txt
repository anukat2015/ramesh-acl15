Title: Piece of Chinese made CRAP
Content:
The thermostat worked for three days and then stopped.  This means that it got REALLY hot because it wouldn't shut down.   Naturally, it stop working in the middle of the night, I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire. The fourth day it stopped working altogether, probably due to over-heating. DON NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP

Title: stylish and cool looking
Content:
This was not the machine I wanted. I read the recommednadtions of the ones i wanted and was disappointed. I went to the store and saw this model. It has a great feel with the rubber handle. It is stylish and looks very contemporay. It is solid and not flimsy at all. I orgianly wanted a all in one with machine, but found they always seem to have problems. Tis machine does what it is supose to do. It bvrews coffee and has a timer. It has the cool little water filter extra whioch gets rid of cholrine build up in the tank. It is a great solid machine.

Title: Everything I expected, but takes time to master
Content:
I love this camera, I had been putting off for years to buy a digital SLR and finally pulled the trigger. I am by no means a pro, but I am tech savvy, so I love all the knobs, buttons, and possibilities to customize. 
I will say that there is no substitue for skill, no matter how good the camera is. Out of the box I started taking pictures and while the quality was impressive, it wasn't exactly magazine-quality or like what'd you see on brochures--that's going to take more skill working the aperture and speed settings using Manual. 
Also, another thing that's very important but often overlooked: Vista comptibility! I didn't even need to install drivers, just plugged in USB and got my pictures. This is not typical! I have several other gadgets (camcorders, printers, etc.) and for some it was a nightmare to get drivers to work. What a relief to see Canon spend the effort to make their products work with current OSs. Thanks Canon!

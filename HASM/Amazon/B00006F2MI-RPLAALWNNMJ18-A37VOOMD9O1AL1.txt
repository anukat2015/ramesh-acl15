Title: Me Neither !!!!
Content:
I wanted so much to like it -- about $100 worth (thank God I got a 30% discount).  But after just two tries and reading these reviews, I'm gonna take it back immediately and MOVE ON.  Why?
1) the finished coffee is not hot, more like warm.
2) the carafe doesn't keep it at "warm" even.
3) the finished coffee is weak, even with addition of more beans
(only made 6 cups, but would have to agree with other reviewers that I can't imagine grinder holding enough beans to brew a strong pot).  And I'm putting in Starbucks Sumatra beans (strong stuff).
4) The water level is difficult to see.
5) I can see just after two uses how the whole mechanism could get clogged with coffee gunk pretty easily and ultimately require daily precise cleaning (not for me thank you).
6) The stainless is nice, but as another poster said, so easily fingerprinted.
7) Oh yeah, it IS a drag to pour from that carafe too -- I didn't have trouble with leakage -- but geesh yeah you do have to practically turn it upside down for the last cup or two.
I think the grind & brew concept is yet to be realized . . . 
Certainly it ain't this Cuisinart (I have the 600 by the way).

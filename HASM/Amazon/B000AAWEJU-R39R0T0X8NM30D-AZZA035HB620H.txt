Title: Disappointed; ineffectual expensive vacuum
Content:
When the hose split in 2 places on my 14 year old Miele, I did no research because I wanted another Miele - I've recommended the brand to anyone listening.  I wonder if this vacuum is now manufactured by a different company?  The S4 Carina is not nearly as good as my original (S2481) - the cord is at least a foot shorter (a real nuisance); the suction is vague and just skims the carpet; the new head is fatter and does not go under my furniture and to switch settings, the tab is too stiff for my toe, so I must bend down to switch from floor to rug (I have area rugs so this is no good) - fortunately, I simply attached my original head (the new one is relegated to the back of the closet) - which slides under furniture and can be "adjusted by toe". (though the suction is of course, poor).  Maneuverability is awkward.
I resent that I spent so much money because I trusted this brand.  If your vacuuming needs are limited to a small floor-only area, and light-weight is important to you, then if the price is right, this vacuum is fine.  Otherwise, keep shopping.

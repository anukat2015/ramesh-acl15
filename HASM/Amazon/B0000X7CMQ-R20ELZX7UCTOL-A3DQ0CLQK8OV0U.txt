Title: ok but .....
Content:
Purchased this coffee maker in Nov. 07. Worked great for 6 months and then stopped working. Water would not go through the maker. Called customer service who stated that I could return it for repairs at any of there service places (which I did). Now 2 1/1 months later, still no coffee maker. Repair shop wants $15 to ship it back. Zojirushi said they contacted the repair shop and told me I would get it back free of charge.  Well still no coffe maker. I believe I will never get it back. Its a good coffee maker, but I'm not willing to shell out another $90 for a pot that will only last 6 months.

Title: Consider the MacBook Pro 13.3" instead
Content:
Why bother with this when the unibody MacBook Pro 2.26 is only $899? Attention college students, Apple has stuffed the educational channels, namely colleges and universities, with 6/8/2010 version of MacBook Pros. If you don't mind the old MagUnSafe adapters, the old ones are good value. They are as low as $899 for the 2.26 and $1,099 for the 2.53GHz.
Consider the MacBook Pro instead.
For those who don't want to carry the bulky 17" or 15.4" just for the matte screen, this is a good alternative? Why? You may apply anti-reflective film directly over the image plane. This is not the same as applying anti-reflective film on the glossy unibody MacBook Pro, because the image actually project about 3mm before hitting the matte film, which degrades the image by reducing clarity.
The plastic body is a vast improvement from the flawed design from May, 2006. The plastic body is more resilient and is not as likely to be dented or be deformed from normal use. The bottom plate is rubberized aluminum. It may help heat dissipation. The previous version has a very poor record with heat dissipation, so hard drive failure rate is significantly higher than any other product on the market (regardless of brand). It is a sliver (like two sheets of paper) thinner than the predecessor. (SO WHAT!)
What's so bad about this unit? 
Let me list the negative aspects of this 'new' product, now I am done with the positive attributes, let me outline the bad and the ugly--regardless of how trivial they might be.
* At $999, it's only $170 less than the MacBook Pro.
* No FireWire of any kind. Apple might as well call this the 'NeuterBook'.
* No IR remote access.
* No backlit keyboard.
* Wider and deeper than the previous version (Sorry, we are not dealing with B-movies, so these are not good attributes).
* A few ounces heavier than the 13.3" MacBook Pro.
* No SD card slot.
I think we are easily giving up more than $170 of convenience and equipment.
Let this product fail. It's not meant to be. Stay away from this.

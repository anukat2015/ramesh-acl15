Title: Wouldn't recommend
Content:
Mine worked fine for the first month, but then quit working. It won't take a charge at all. When I try plugging it into the USB connector, nothing happens. The battery is dead and I cannot turn it on, and the computer doesn't recognize it. I have 3 computers and tried connecting it to each of them with the same results. It's a worthless piece of junk now. I wish I had purchased a different brand.

Title: I love the MacBook...MS will never have me again!!!!
Content:
I love my MacBook.  I was so afraid to change from my long time MS-DOS/Windows usage, but I did it with my most recent purchase and I will never return to a DOS/Windows product again unless I am forced too.  I love the ease of the MAC and I can't remember going this long without some sort of virus or crash like I had on my Windows platform every time I turned around.  Sorry Bill Gates, but until you build your operating system from the ground up like Apple I can't even consider switching back.
I LOVE MY MAC!!!!!!!!!

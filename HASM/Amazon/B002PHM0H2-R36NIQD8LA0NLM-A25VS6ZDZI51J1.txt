Title: Never Ever A Sony Anymore
Content:
I bought a Sony VAIO VGN-FW280J/H 16.4-Inch Laptop (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 7200 RPM 320 GB Hard Drive, BD-RW, Vista Premium) Gray, in May 2009 for the good price of USD 999.99. I didn't open the box for about one month, because I have 2 other Laptops an Apple and a HP. 
Then I used this Sony for about 2 months as a desktop, but not that much, so I didn't move or bring this Sony on th go. Then for somehow it builds moisture inside the LCD, I believe due to the hot weather, I contacted Sony Support, they asked me to send the unit to Sony Repair in San Diego which I did and they received the unit on 10.05.2009. Yesterday on 10.20.2009 at 8 pm I got an email saying that the repair estimate is USD 699.99 plus tax, whaaaaaat?...I called right away asked them to send it back, this is crazy... 
I just can not believe that this is a SONY, one of the biggest company in electronics/multimedia/movie industry. 
I will never ever buy a sony anymore...

Title: Bomb Diggity Mp3 Player
Content:
Okay, it's not an iPod...but it is what it is.  I bought this mp3 player on sale, so maybe that made it a great deal.  However, it is usually priced much lower than the iPod and still retains many of the same features plus more!  
    Sansa made a wise decision when they included a MicroSD port as perhaps the best extra feature for their mp3 players.  You can easily double or triple your data capacity and interchange cards that hold different movies or play lists.  Does iPod offer that?  NO, but probably in the future they will have something similar. 
    Other pluses include the radio tuner, so you can catch the news or  emergency weather information.  I thought the voice recorder option was pretty cool as well.
    I'd say one of the drawbacks is the interface or software running on the Sansa mp3 players.  They are fairly easy to use, and similar to iPod functionality, but I feel it could be better.  With the ability of the Fuze, I think Sansa could have offered a better looking interface and perhaps the function of video games.  However, there is the option of RockBox...
    Looks are definitely not everything, Sansa mp3 players pack quite a punch for the size and price.  For those of you that do care about looks, it has a very sleek designed case and the circular LED back light is pretty cool.

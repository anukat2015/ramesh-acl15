Title: DO NOT buy!!!
Content:
I bought last winter and it worked fine. Wormed up pretty good and I tought that I made a good choice. But......I started using this fall and it worked fine for a couple days. Then I heard sound like something snap, so I turned around and looked. The heater was sparkling and smork was coming out. DO NOT buy!

Title: A real piece of overpriced garbage
Content:
First: No matter what kind of bean you use, it always brews weak, insipid coffee.
Second: The parts are a pain to deal with, and get messy very quickly.
Third: The grinder doesn't grind well at all, gets clogged with damp 'goo'.
Fourth: It clogs and has 'backed up' on many occasions, resulting in a mess.
It's a complete waste of money-badly designed and cheaply made. 
A couple of 'pros'. It looks good on the countertop. The thermal carafe is nice looking.
Seriously: If you want decent coffee, go buy a press or a twenty-dollar cheapie, just don't buy this thing if you are a serious coffee drinker.

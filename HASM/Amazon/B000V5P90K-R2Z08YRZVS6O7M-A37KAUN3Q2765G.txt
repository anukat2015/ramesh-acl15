Title: Sharp, Fast, Well-built Canon Mid-range DSLR
Content:
There are numerous great, lengthy reviews so this one will only be a short summary:
Pros: 
-  Excellent resolution
-  Good dynamic range
-  Virtually noise-free even at high ISO 
-  Great long exposure capabilities
-  Nine point auto-focus system
-  Large 3.0" LCD
-  Built tough (slid from seat to floor and hit metal bar making loud noise yet still alive and kicking)
-  Dust reduction with integrated cleaning system 
-  Excellent battery life, even greater with optional 2-batteries vertical grip
Cons:
-  Poor automatic white balance performance
-  Slow continuous "burst" rate, small buffer
-  No mass storage USB support
Other: Would have purchased the 50D with higher megapixel for greater enlargement capabilities but did not want to deal with just-released model issues, but otherwise a great camera.

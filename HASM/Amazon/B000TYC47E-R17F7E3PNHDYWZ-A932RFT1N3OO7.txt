Title: Loud. Very loud.
Content:
Pros: Heats space. 
Has a timer.
Remote control.
Cons: Manual makes no sense.
Heats small [we're talking two square feet] space.
Auto turn on thermostat control doesn't actually do anything.
IT'S VERY LOUD. I'm not kidding, nobody else in the office will take this space heater from me because it's just too loud.
Thoughts: It's a neat space heater. For the money, you get a lot of features, at least on paper. Realistically it's not a good purchase.

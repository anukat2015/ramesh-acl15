Title: Worthy upgrade from the EOS-30D
Content:
If you own a Canon 30D, this camera is a worthy upgrade.  If you're still working with a Canon 20D, it's a no-brainer.  The 40D is more rugged, has a gorgeous 3-inch color LCD, is more customizable than any previous mid-range model from Canon, and has a speedier 6.5 fps continuous shooting rate that's perfect for most sports.  And I haven't even mentioned cool features like Live View and the automated internal dust-removal system.
At 10.1 MP the 40D has all the resolution most of us really need, and when bundled with the 28-135mm lens you've got every focal length from normal to mid-telephoto (45mm to 216mm equivalent)covered.  Life is too short to be using last year's digital SLR.
The only "defect" I could come up with is the manual for this camera, which is complete in terms of enumerating features and options, but not so illuminating when it comes to explaining how and why you might use these features.  The best book available on Canon digital photography right now is Canon EOS 40D Guide to Digital Photography.  I recommend this camera and this companion book highly.

Title: I Love This Netbook/Notebook!
Content:
I have had this netbook for about a month and love it.  
I started out looking for a 10.1" netbook and had some models in mind, but couldn't decide.  So I decided one Saturday to go to several stores and see them in person.  I then saw the Aspire 1410 and compared the features.  There is no comparison, a netbook or a full notebook in a small package, this is a no brainer  I was sold.  
As a sideline I was originally considering an Asus, but after reading all the reviews about bad customer service, I decided that would not be a good idea.  Where as, the reviews on Acer customer service were very positive.  Fortunately, I have not had to test this.

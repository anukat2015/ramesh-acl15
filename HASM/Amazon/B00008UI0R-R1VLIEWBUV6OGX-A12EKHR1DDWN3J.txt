Title: It ABSOLUTELY had to go back!
Content:
I had this vacuum for less than 24 hours and was so grateful that I could get my money back to put it towards something that would actually work.  I had researched vacuums for a while and decided upon this one because of its reviews, size, features, and mainly that I absolutely LOVE my Hoover Floormate that I bought 8 mos ago, so I trusted the brand.  When my husband and I unpackaged this vacuum, the first thing we noticed is that the wand/ vacuum head does not latch into an upright position- meaning when you pick up this vacuum by the canister and wand, the vacuum head is hanging loosely swinging about- NOT helpful if you have uneven surfaces (or intend to use it on stairs).  There is a "upholstery attachment" which we realized immediately was a joke- the bristles would not stay attached to the plastic component- they just fell on the floor, unless there was enought suction to hold them in. I think what really irritated me is that I have two pets and mild allergies, so I vacuum twice a week, and when I attempted to vacuum with this, anytime I changed a direction it would leave a thin line of pet hair on the carpet.  I definately do not want to see my allergens still on the carpet!  Lastly, the adjustable suction control on the handle of the wand is helpful, however if you added any suction, it would prevent the brush and wheels from turning on the vacuum head, if you didn't, it would pick up very little.  All in all, I could not have been more disappointed.  I looked forward to buying this vacuum for months and now am back to using my old Eureeka, oddly enough, I have an all new respect for it.

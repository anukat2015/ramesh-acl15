Title: 2 Years and still the software sucks
Content:
I have owned the Zen for over two years.  The software has never worked properly.  Customer Support is marginal.  I will never buy another Creative product.
The organizer has never properly synced with Outlook, despite a number of software revisions.
The PC transfer software is intermittent in its ability to transfer playlists, then stops transferring them all together.
I bought this as an anti-iPod move.  Boy, was that a mistake!  I was seduced by the large screen, something about which I really don't care about at this point.  I bought this to be a music player, not to watch videos on a miniature screen.
So, basically, what I've ended up with is an overpriced 30GB hard drive for storing music.  The software is buggy, and has been for over two years.
I'm not an Apple fan, but this piece of dung may change all that.
Creative does not support its products.  Stay away!

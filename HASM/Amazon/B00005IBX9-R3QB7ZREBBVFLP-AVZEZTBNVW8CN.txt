Title: Great coffee maker, no real complaints
Content:
While I received this coffee maker for free via credit card rewards, having used it for the past year, I can say with certainty that I would have shelled out the money for it if necessary. It looks nice and well-made, is easy to use (albeit it's a bit tall), makes a great cup of coffee, and has the additional perks other reviews have reported (solid construction, 1-4 cup setting, variable-temperature warming plate, filter, etc.). 
The only criticism I could possibly come up with, as has already been mentioned, is that the cup markings inside the unit itself are difficult to see. This can be particularly troublesome, as there is no external reservoir indicator. However, as I measure using the carafe (which is very easy to do) rather than the reservoir markings, it's never been a significant issue for me.

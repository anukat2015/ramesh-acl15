Title: GLASS TOO THIN
Content:
THE COFFEE WAS GOOD BUT WASHING THE GLASS POT WAS A PROBLEM.
THE SMALLEST BUMP FROM THE FAUCET AND THE GLASS POT CRACKED RECOMMEND A THERMAL POT FOR THIS PRODUCT.
ALSO THE FILTER BASKET DID NOT CLEAN EASY EVEN AFTER USING A PAPER FILTER IN IN.  RECOMMEND A PLASTIC BLACK FILTER AND ALSO USE A PAPER FILTER IN IT AS WELL.

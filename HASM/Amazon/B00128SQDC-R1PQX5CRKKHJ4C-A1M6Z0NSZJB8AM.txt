Title: Best Digital SLR in its Class
Content:
I bought this camera for my family's special Disney World vacation and took about 1,300 pictures with it over an eight days period and was utterly stunned by the results.  It was really easy to use, performance was lightning quick and the zoom lens on digital SLR feels so natural.  I can take pictures pretty much as fast as I can press the shutter which is really great.  I shot mostly in Auto or Potrait mode and the picture quality especially of potraits were breath-taking.  People's skin and complexion were exceptionally sharp, soft and natural looking not washed out like my other point-and-shoot camera.  And I absolutely love the wide angle composition that I was able to get from my 18-70mm lens so I get the people and the landscape at the same time.
It's a significant premium over my Canon Powershot S3 point-and-shoot camera but well worth it.  I am starting to learn to use it's more advance feature for creative photography and loving it even more.

Title: Everything we wanted with easy setup
Content:
We wanted to cut back on costs as well as use less energy, so we researched programmable thermostats and chose this one based on the good reviews.  After installing the thermostat and using it for a few days, I can say that we are VERY pleased and that it lives up to the good reviews.  It came with everything needed to install as well as very detailed instructions on installation and on using the many customization features.  It's tedious to set all of your daily options - I mean, you have the option of setting four different programs a day! - but after it's set, it's very easy to just let it go and you only need to hit one or two buttons to override without changing your saved settings.  It also doesn't reset your features if the batteries go dead, which is good to know.

Title: Great Performing Laptop So Far
Content:
Have used now for over a month and have found this to be a great little machine.  Only problems I've had are related to Win 7 compatability and not the Laptop.
Pros: Great speed
      Full keyboard with number pad
      Easy volumn adjustment with visible slider
Cons: No separation between touch pad and buttons - too easy to get both fingers on touch pad

Title: No improvement over TX series
Content:
This is not an improvement over other HP tablets.
1.  The viewing angle in tablet mode is completely unusable.  You have to hover right over the screen or the colors and details get lost.  In short, this has a very, very narrow viewing angle.  This is one of the promised corrections of new devices such as the iPad and the Fujitsu series tablets.
2.  There is minimal improvement of processing speed over the Tx2 series.  The drive at 7200 rpm helps, but it is rather a disappointment.
The good news is that the battery lasts quite a long time (ca. 4 hours with media, do not believe the 9 hour claim).
This was a huge disappointment overall.
In tablet mode you have to rotate the tablet backside so the back is now front if you connect a ceiling (classroom) mounted projector...someone needs to write a driver that rotates the tablet view independently of the VGA out signal.

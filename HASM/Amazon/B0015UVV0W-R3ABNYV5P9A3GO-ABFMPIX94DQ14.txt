Title: Could've been better.
Content:
I had been using the non remote control digital Vortex heater for years now and love it.  It's better than the conventional heaters and heats up the rooms fast and evenly.  When my heater broke which is a common problem with the digital vortex heater which have a tendency to break after about a year. (I was on my second one but kept buying because they work so well)  So when I saw this remote control version I wanted one in my room because I'm lazy to get up at night to turn it on or off and since my heater broke I picked one up.  Love the design and remote control......... HOWEVER this new version is not as nearly as powerful as the old Digital Vortex Heaters.  The max temperature you can go to is only 85 degrees but the old Vortex is 90 degrees and I do notice a big difference in power as the older can make the room super hot in a short time but with this heater it can get very warm after some time but I do miss the power of the older heater.  That's my only gripe but other than that it's a good heater.

Title: good mixer
Content:
This is a very nice product, HOWEVER, it should be slightly hotter at drink temperature.  Also, the liquid does stick in the pot every time.  I even used water only instead of milk.  It makes no difference.  Those are my only 2 gripes and they are minor.  I still recommend this neat little cocoa maker.
  I am a band patient and this mixes up my whey protein for a great hot morning drink full of protein. I add a TBSP. of benefiber and a scoop of Ovaltine plus my scoop of Protein.  The recipe book is quite good also.  More stores should carry this product, but they don't.  Go figure!!!

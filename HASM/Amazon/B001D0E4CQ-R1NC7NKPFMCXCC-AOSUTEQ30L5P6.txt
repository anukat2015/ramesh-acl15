Title: It does more and less as advertised...
Content:
I have had this item for almost 2 weeks now. I have a mixed bag on this player so I will try to keep my review as short as possible. 
I have had mp3 players since they became popular 10 years ago. I have mainly had Ipods but I had an early Archos and Zune.
I do have to admit that after the first day I wanted to return it. When I connected it to my computer and started to upload video files, within 5 minutes the screen went dark and it shut itself off. I tried for what seems like 20 min to restart but nothing, absolutely no response. Luckily an hour later I just pressed power one more time and it started back up. No one would blame me for wanting to return it however all I have done is print out the return bar codes and decide to try it for a day or 2. Since then there are definitely good and bads.
Pros: Great video quality, ability to adjust the aspect ratios some, plays a lot of video formats (.mp4, .avi, .mov), good sound from headset and speaker, love the amount of space of the hard drive, very intuitive
Cons: Battery life is maybe 4 hours video, takes 8 hours to fully charge, it has reset a couple of times, web browser is a little clunky, you have to pay for additional codecs to play certain formats and installing them is another headache
It was either this or a PS3 and I still havent returned it. I also havent bought the DVR accessory but its looking like I will soon. It is good but if I knew about the codecs and accessories I would have thought about the PS3 a little more.

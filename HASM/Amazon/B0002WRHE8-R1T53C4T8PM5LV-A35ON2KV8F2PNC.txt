Title: Works fine for me
Content:
I question the ethics of an individual who makes a claim that an item they purchased is a lemon..only to mention a few brief words that they are in full conscience going to sell the lemon to some other poor unsuspecting sucker. Making critical comments about a manufacturer selling lemons and then turning around and doing the same demonstrates the fact that perhaps not everyone opinion on somthing should be trusted. 
I have this product it has been running on High with ONE cylinder in it for 2 hours now and has warmed an uninsulated 22x22 garage nicely on this windy 35F degree day.

Title: Nice product
Content:
This heater has been a wonderful addition to our family.  The reviews that say this is unable to heat a room are lying.  Today the temp is -20 and so the house is rather cold, we keep the heat down to save money.  I have the lasko heater in the computer room for when i'm working.  It easily heats the 12x12 room on low.  On high it doesn't take long perhaps 15 minutes.  It blows the heat quite far and the whole rooms seems to warm.  I think it performs best when sitting on floor.  This heater does all it claims and is a very nice product.  The grill is not over hot to touch on low setting which is nice to know with children present.  It does make noise though, not too loud but could be bothersome.

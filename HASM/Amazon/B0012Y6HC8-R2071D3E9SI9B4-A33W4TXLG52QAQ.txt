Title: Nice Camera
Content:
This is my First DSLR, so I can't compare to others, but picture quality is NICE. as DSLRs, all will have a learning curve, but it is truly an amazing camera.
DSLR does NOT replace a point and shoot in portability, so don't plan to replace your point and shoot camera with this, and costs add up once you start adding extra lenses, but the pictures are awesome, and the possibilities are endless. It is not a professional camera per say, but pictures from it make it to published print all the time.
It's that good.

Title: Great storage and sound, low battery life
Content:
Battery life : was supposed to be 24 hours. It failed. The battery lasts 12 hours or less. That's without me playing games or videos or changing songs constantly. 
Storage: Its amazing! I've fit my entire music collection in there and its still got room. 
Music Quality:  Perfect. The sound comes thru so clear and pure. Even when I download the music from old scratched up cds it modifies it and the music sounds better than it did on the CD. 
Cover flow: Can be really obnoxious as its impossible to turn it off. When I need to turn the volume down on a song that happened to be louder than the rest it requires me to pull the thing out of my pocket and turn it so it thinks its vertical and then i can get to the volume. This process is actually very unnecessary and as cover flow is not really useful, its annoying. Coverflow looks very cool though. Sometimes, when very bored, it's nice to go through, but putting it as a menu option would have been a better choice. 
Video games : I didn't realize that it would come with games, so this was a pleasant surprise. The included games are a great boredom.
I also bought these earbuds to go with it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IG66VS
They work well.
Even with the not great battery life, this is a five star item.

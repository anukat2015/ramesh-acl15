Title: Frustrated
Content:
I've had this machine for over a year.  Great tasting coffee but a pain to maintain.  It's extremely slow in making the coffee, taking sometimes over an hour to make one pot of coffee.  Cleaning with vinegar doesn't help speed up the process. Now I've quit using the machine because the water runs out of the bottom just about as fast as I pour it in.

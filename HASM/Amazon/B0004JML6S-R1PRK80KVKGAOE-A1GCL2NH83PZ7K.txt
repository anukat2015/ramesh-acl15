Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
When my old maker broke, I tried several (at family and friends houses, bought and returned one), then decided on the steel Cuisinart.  The coffee just wasn't as good as my old Krups.  Bought the FME2 (just like the 4) and it has made amazing coffee for almost three years.  Better than starbucks by a mile, as good as Peets.  This one is a winner.  The earlier negative reviews seem based on nothing but incompetence, if you actually read them.

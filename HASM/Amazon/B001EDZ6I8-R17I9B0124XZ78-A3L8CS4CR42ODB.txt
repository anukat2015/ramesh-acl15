Title: Vornado Personal Space Heater
Content:
This is a great product!! It works especially well under my desk at work. I live in Michigan and work in an old, drafty school building. When the winter winds howl it is VERY cold in my office. This space heater is just right for freezing cold, blustery winter days. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't get really, really warm. I previously had a similar type of under-desk heater, which died last winter. This current model is not as powerful as the old model. It is still nice and toasty warm, but on days when the wind-chill is below zero it has to work harder and longer to keep the warmth flowing. HOWEVER, I would be very, very uncomfortable without it. I'm very happy with this item.

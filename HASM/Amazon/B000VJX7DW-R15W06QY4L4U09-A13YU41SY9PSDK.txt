Title: Won't autofocus, a dud
Content:
All I've read here are rave reviews but my experience is that the D300 is vastly overrated as a shooter. I bought mine brand new at Best Buy with a Tamron zoom lens and right out of the box it wouldn't autofocus properly. The motor would whirr and the lens tried feebly to focus in on a the subject without success. 
Took it back to Best Buy and we tried a Nikon 55-200VR lens and that didn't work any better. I was going to try another D300 but they were out of stock and I was already soured on this product. I've owned Nikons before -- I still have the remarkable D40 -- and was looking to step up. For the hefty $2,400 price (with lens), I expected a lot more. Deeply disappointed. 
I wound up buying a Sony A700, a vastly superior camera in most respects, even with the kit 18-70 lens, and never looked back. Plus I saved $1,000 to boot. 
Nikon has a good rep, but the great d40 notwithstanding Sony Alpha-Series cams outperform in many ways, including easy of use, photo quality and build. Nikon has the edge in customer service, however. And, value-wise, hard to beat the D40.

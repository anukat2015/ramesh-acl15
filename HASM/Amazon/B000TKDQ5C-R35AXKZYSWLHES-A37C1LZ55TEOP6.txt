Title: Great Heater
Content:
I bought this heater for my cubicle at work because it is pretty chilly there. This heater has made my work environment much more comfortable without taking up a lot of space. I enjoy the fact that it has an adjustable thermostat as well as the fact that it turns itself off and on in order to maintain the temperature. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a small but powerful heater.

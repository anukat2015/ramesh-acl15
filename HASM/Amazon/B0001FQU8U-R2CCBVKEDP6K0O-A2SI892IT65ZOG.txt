Title: Well.... I like it.
Content:
After considering cutting holes in walls for wall mount units or trying to fit those ugly window jobs that always look jerry-rigged from both the inside and out I decided on a portable unit.  I purchased the KW85 and had it installed within an hour after getting it home on a rather hot day.   That alone was a pleasant surprise.  So far (2 months later) it still works just fine.  
I did take the precaution of running the dehumidifyer first for a couple of hours after initial installation so that the compressor would not be working so hard to cool the space.   I also made sure that I followed the manufacturers recommendations on the unit placement and exhaust hose installation.  If the intake vents are obstucted I can see how the unit would not work well, if at all.
Bottom line - if you have a minimum 3 feet x 4 feet space you can put it in and still vent properly this unit works wonderfully.  If you don't have the floor space to dedicate to it and or would have to put a tight bend or more in the exhaust hose then you will likely be disappointed. 
Sitting in cooled comfort with no holes in my walls... :)

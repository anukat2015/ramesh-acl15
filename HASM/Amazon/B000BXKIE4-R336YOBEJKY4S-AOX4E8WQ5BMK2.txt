Title: Nice vacuum with electrical problem
Content:
Had a 30 year old Electrolux canister vac and loved it.  It finally wore out so I purchased the Electrolux brand again.  Love all the new features and it all works well except for the electrical connection when using the brush roll feature to vacuum carpets.  When the hose is extended completely, the brush roll stops, when it's loosened, it runs again.  My husband and I determined that the 3 prongs on the hose that attach to the canister become disconnected enough when the hose is taught to stop the flow of electricity to the brush roll.  Hope this is an easy fix.  We purchased the vac about a month ago and this problem was evident from day one.  Electrolux is a good company and we hope they'll fix this minor problem or replace the vacuum.

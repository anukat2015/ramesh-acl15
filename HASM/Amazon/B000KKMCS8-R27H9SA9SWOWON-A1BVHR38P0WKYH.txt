Content:
After reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I was so excited for it to arrive! My apartment gets so drafty in the winter.  Unfortunately, when it arrived, I could hear something rattling around inside. Upon closer inspection, I realized that there was a completely loose metal screw INSIDE the heater, which was impossible to remove without completely dismantling the heater.  I didn't even turn it on, for fear of what could happen, and I promptly repacked it and sent it back via UPS.  It cost me $13.32 to return this item, and I have nothing to show for it.  Instead, I ventured to a local hardware store and found the Pelonis Oscillating Ceramic Heater with Thermostat (a much cheaper heater) and it's working great in my small studio. My advice to you is read the return policies carefully before making a purchase on Amazon! Not all people selling include return shipping!

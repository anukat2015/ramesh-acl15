Title: Sucks great!!!
Content:
I've had this vacuum for about six months now.  So here's the facts...
I wish there were more attachments.  Though I must say the turbo brush works great!!!  I have a leather couch but the cushions are removable and our dog has the coat similar to a shepard, and long hair golder retreiver.  You have no idea what gets stuck on the not leather fabric underneath the cushions.  WELL I use the turbo brush and it brings it all right up.  Use it one way starting away from you and then move towards you vertically.  Works great!
When using the handle and hose part make sure you turn off the vacuum before you move it after your done.  Since the brush still works while your using the hose when it's still on and you move it carpet fibers get blown everywhere.  
And emptying the canister can be messy sometimes but I take a garbage bag and push part of it under the canister while still locked in place then unlock it and empty it that way so your not carrying crap away and through the house.  
Overall the sucking power on this surpassed out 10 year old rainbow so I'm very please with it just not needing water.  I would like more attachments to be made for this like longer hoses or longer extension arms.

Title: Well made, excellent for the intended purpose.
Content:
I have a lot of hardwood and tile floors and stairs. I also have some deep pile carpet and upholstery and a beloved kitty cat. 
No seat in the house is too good for him to shed upon. As much as I love him, I don't like what he leaves behind. I had a Panasonic upright commercial vac for 15+ years that served me well and although still functions it is not right right for my new floor coverings, nor does it do a good job of removing the cat hair.
I am very pleased with this vacuum. I believe another reviewer wrote it could suck the chrome off a hitch -- that's an accurate assessment. It is powerful but has 2 settings, high and low so if you want to vacuum your hitch and leave the chrome intact you can.
Things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars:
Cord storage. My Panasonic had a manual wrap too but this machine has no way to keep the cord from raveling off when moving it. I got a velcro strap to remedy that. 
No on board tool storage. I have to store the extra tools (crevice device, upholstery brush, etc) in a bag hanging in the garage where I keep the vacuum. A Kenmore canister I had had a lift top with storage for these.  
There is no way these things would stop me from buying this vacuum again. 
Someone commented that positive reviews for this vac were from Metropolitan employees. I don't know about that but I don't work for them and don't know anyone who does.

Title: Powerful Compact Vacuum.
Content:
I am very pleased with this vacuum cleaner.  I am impressed with the amount of debris it picks up compared to other vacuums I owned.
I do clean out the dust catcher after each use, along with cleaning and washing the filter with water.  
Had it now for 6 months, and it is still running great.

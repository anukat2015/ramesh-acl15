Title: acer 1410
Content:
nice compact very lightweight, decent battery life.
at acer.com you must install your own win 7-- but do it, as it speeds the computer dramatically.
not as fast as my acer netbook w win 7 and intel duo processor ($550), but for the price, this one is still a bargain.
cover shows finger prints badly.
great brite screen, full keyboard, good for men fingers.

Title: Awesome
Content:
I paid $100 in total for my 4GB Zen V Plus. Much less than I paid for my daughter's Ipod Nano. It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  But the sound quality, ease of use and how light it is just works.  I really love mine and now my daughter wishes she could have gotten mine instead.
I have seen some complaints about the controls for someone who has big hands and I can see how that might be a problem, but isn't for me and I am just the average girl.
I would reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a 4GB. Be sure to shp for a bargain, because they are out there.  Truthfully if you can get a bargain on the 8GB Why not go just a little bigger and have more space. 
I do wish it was just a little bigger and a had a little bigger screen, but for the price and the size this is awesome!

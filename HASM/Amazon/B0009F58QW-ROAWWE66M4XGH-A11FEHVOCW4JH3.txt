Title: Cools well but noisy
Content:
Great in what the company says it does, but be prepared for the noise.  Most of the noise appears to be produced by the fan which blows very strongly.  Inexplicably, it seems there are only two fan settings:  stronger and strongest.  Engineering to avoid noise producing turbulent flow may also help.  The grills of my two units also do not turn down due to poor fitting, either a design flaw or a production error.
On the other hand, customer service is great!  The vinyl window kits did not fit my narrow windows, and they quickly sent me the foam ones for free.

Title: BUNN - A mark of excellence?
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my mother so I don't have personal experience but, I do have feedback from the my mother's home.  The first thing is that the cover for the coffee pot is flimsy.  Secondly it will do as it states, "It will make 12 cups of coffee in 3 minutes" but, it will not slow down the brewing process for fewer cups like other premium coffee makers.  Thus the idea is good but the 'maker' needs a few more bells and whistles to bring it up to a standard of excellence that the name implies.

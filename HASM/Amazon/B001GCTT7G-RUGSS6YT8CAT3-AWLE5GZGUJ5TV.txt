Title: Devices Malfunctioning
Content:
Dear Sir/Madam,
I'm sorry to inform you that I received the Apple MacBook MB466LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop with a malfunction in the hard disk! I sent you a message with this concern, but there was no respond from your side! I had to buy a replacement from the local market.
Furthermore, the used speaker I received (BOSE SoundDock) is malfunctioning as well, it makes noise and the remote control is not working!
I am an old customer for amazon.com , but this is the first negative experience I have ever since I started dealing with you... I expect that you guys check on any item before you send it to the customer, shouldn't you?
This is the case, what do you think?
I appreciate your prompt respond.
Best regards,
Abbas Rahim

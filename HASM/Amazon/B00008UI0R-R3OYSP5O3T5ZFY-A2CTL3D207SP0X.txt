Title: Wow!
Content:
I am amazed and kind of embarrassed at the amount of household dirt this  vacuum collects. Easy to use because it helps pull itself along. Only complaint is that I have to empty the cannister very often. It may be a smaller collection area (capacity) ,or I just might have more dirt to collect ( I have three cats). We have much more "suction-power" than the Electrolux it replaced for less than half the price!

Title: Improved but not perfect yet
Content:
I recently had the older model Grind and Brew and loved it.  Unfortunately, the motor burned out on it which led me to purchase this model.  Overall, I think this is an improved model except for one problem.  The water level measurement system [is not good].  It's very hard to tell when you've reached the level you want unless you're a tall person.  I'm 5'10", and while it's on my counter, I have to move it to the edge and stand on my toes to see when I reach the right level.  Other than that, I think the parts are easier to clean and that's why I gave it 4 stars.

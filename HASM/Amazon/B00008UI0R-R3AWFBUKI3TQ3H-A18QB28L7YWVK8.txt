Title: please don't waste your time and money on this
Content:
This is the first time I've been moved to write a review on Amazon and sadly it's because the product was SO crappy.  We bought this vacuum cleaner just about 3 months ago and were completely underwhelmed with its performance (variable), weight (heavy), size (totally unsuitable for use on stairs), and many electronic spinning attachments, all of which seemed to get clogged up regularly.  The last straw came today when I was vacuuming dust up from a hard floor in one room of our house, heard a sort of "poof" noise, and looked behind me to see clouds of black smoke billowing from the vacuum cleaner.  Needless to say, it is dead as a doornail, for no apparent reason.  When I called the nearest dealer, and explained what had happened, the guy from the shop started laughing and said this model is poorly made and breaks down all the time, that the typical wait for parts to repair is 3-4 weeks minimum, and that his shop no longer stocks these vacuum cleaners because the quality is so lousy.  I really regret having bought this.  I have had a bagless vacuum in the past (Dyson) and it worked fine - the issue is with this make and model, not the concept.  No more Hoovers for our house.

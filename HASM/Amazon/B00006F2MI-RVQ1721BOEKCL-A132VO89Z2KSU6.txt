Title: Great coffee
Content:
We got this machine as a wedding present a year and a half ago, and I can safely say that it is our favorite wedding present... It makes delicious coffee in the morning, and my husband and I hate getting coffee outside now, so it actually saves us money as well!
It is annoying to clean out the machine after every use, but on the other hand, setting up the machine the night before really makes me look forward to the morning. We live in a 2br apt, and I leave the door open so I can wake up to the grinder. It isn't quiet, but it is a good way to wake up to the morning. By the time I get ready, my coffee is steaming and waiting for me. 
One thing I noticed is to get 1 cup of coffee, I have to use 3 scoops (the scoop is included) and fill the water up to the "3" mark...but the amount of water required to get to 1 is really minimal. 
Great machine, I'd highly recommend it. Mine gets used 4-5 days a week, and we don't have any problems with the machinery. Maybe that's because we bought ours at a retail store and it didn't get bumped around? Bummer because I was going to buy my sister one from Amazon.

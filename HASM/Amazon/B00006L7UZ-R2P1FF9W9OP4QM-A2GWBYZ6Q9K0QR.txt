Title: Good cheap garage heater
Content:
I purchased this heater about 2 years ago to keep my garage about the freezing level, principally to melt ice and snow from the cars, but also to provide a comfortable sleeping environment for my dog (and to keep his water from freezing).  For this purpose, it works very well, and even keeps the snow melted from my snowthrower, which I keep on the opposite side of the garage.  It was quite easy to install after getting all the proper fittings and hoses, which are not included.
I do have some complaints, which keeps me from giving this 5 stars.
1. Clearance is very important.  When the burner ignites, I'm always alarmed because of the small ball of fire that the heater emits across the burner.
2. Because of the radiant heat nature, I have burned my hands while working under the heater, similar to getting a sunburn.
3. I've had problems with the pilot light going out.  It is easily adjustable with a screwdriver, but is very sensitive and this was very annoying to fine-tune in the beginning.  I still have to adjust it about once a year.
4. The garage always smells like natural gas.
This heater worked well in my situation, because I had natural gas stubbed into the garage when the house was under construction.  Had I not done this, I would probably opt for an electric heater next time, and this means you need 220 volts.  Depending on the size and type of heater, most also require some type of vent.
I would recommend this heater as it works as advertised for my 625 SF garage.  However, I also recommend you explore other options first.

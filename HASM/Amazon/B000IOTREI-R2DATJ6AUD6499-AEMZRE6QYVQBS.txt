Title: a slight adjustment
Content:
My basement office--a.k.a. 'the man cave'--is for me not unlike the Garden of Eden. Still, about 20 mornings per year it's just a little too cold.
I could attack this with the home heating equivalent of using a hammer to kill a mosquito, turning up the heat and arming every single corner of the place to about five degrees above the status quo. But that costs money.
Instead, I bought the Presto HeatDish Plus Footlight two years ago for those cold winter days when my favorite space in the house needs just a touch of extra warmth. It's got good adjustment and, with a little practice, can be focused on the area where I sit in front of my desk in my stocking feet and do the thing I do.
I recommend this economical, highly concentrated, easily adjustable solution to one of life's cold zones.

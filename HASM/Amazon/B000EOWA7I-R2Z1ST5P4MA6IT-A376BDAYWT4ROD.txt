Title: Nice little vacuum
Content:
This is a nice little vacuum ideal for a car. I dont like dirt, leaves and dust which settles down by the driver side due to constant in and out. This thingy is perfect for spot cleaning. Its wet and dry vacuum giving it an edge. the suction is good at 12V. Not noisy and i dont care even if it was. My friend and me ordered these together. unfortunately his does not work. It doesnt start when plugged in the cigarette lighter socket. He is going to get a different product.
Anyways, its a small tidy machine. i repeat its good for spot cleaning. it doesnt suck like the regular home vacuum guys.

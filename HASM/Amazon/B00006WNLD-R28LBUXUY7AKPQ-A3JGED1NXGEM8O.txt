Title: Disappointing.....
Content:
The on/off switch broke five months after I purchased this product -   bought it in May 2009; switch malfunctioned in September 2009.  I only make one cup of coffee a day, so it wasn't a matter of over-use.  Prior to this, I'd been very satisfied, but now I feel like I've thrown money down a hole.

Title: Keeps me quite toasty!
Content:
This heater definitely puts out a lot of heat. I use it at work pretty much everyday. I mostly keep it on level 1 but sometimes i'll put it on level 2 for a minute or two. I have it right next to me so it really can't stay on level 2 for too long. You'll melt your face off! It sounds like it might be loud but when you walk a couple feet away you can't really hear it. That could just be because of the room I'm in. I've been keeping the heater on 8 hours a day and I still haven't had any problems with it. I've had it since August. I'm probably going to buy another one for the house to save on the heating bill.

Title: Great product
Content:
I received this computer yesterday.  I love it.  I'm not a computer expert and I got it up and running in a few minutes.  Easy to use.  I was a little leary of Vista having heard about problems but have encountered none so far.  My old laptop was a hulk and I had run out of disk space.
This one zips along.

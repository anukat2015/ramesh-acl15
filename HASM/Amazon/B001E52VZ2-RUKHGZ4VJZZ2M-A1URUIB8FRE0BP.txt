Title: Best Light-weight vacuum ever
Content:
This is my second Eureka Mighty-Mite. Although I still have my 15 year old Mighty-Mite The Boss but  have now put it in my Garden House to vacuum up potting soil I drop. I have done everything with that vacuum including using it to vacuum my back porch, leaves and all. Hubby put a hole in the hose about 5 years ago and sealed it with Duct Tape and it is as good as new. It is making a lot more noise now and overheats after it is on for more than 10 minutes, hence my decision to get a new one. It is so light weight that although I have had two hip replacements, I have no problem at all carrying this vacuum up two flights of stairs.
If this Boss holds up half as well as my other one, I will be more than pleased. Just make sure you get The Boss. All others are not as good.
Oh, this Boss has more Amps than my other one as well !!!

Title: This will make you angry
Content:
Well before you get all thrilled about this vacuum cleaner, please realize it is only a vacuum cleaner.  However, if you read all the reviews on nearly all the Miele models you will find people nearly ecstatic about them.  
Don't be fooled; this is an excellent vacuum cleaner and you should buy it as I have with no regrets.  It is quiet, does well with carpet, is light and nearly no exhaust gets out to fill your lungs.  But ask any European about it and they will all scratch their heads and tell you that nearly all the vacuum cleaners in Europe are quiet, light, etc. just like the Miele (which is of course at least designed and likely made in Europe as well).
When you buy this Miele, you will notice it is not rocket science coming up with this design.  Why don't ALL vacuum companies make a decent vacuum like this?  Why are we stuck with the junk sold from Hoover, Kenmore, Eureka and others that ruin your hearing, break by just looking at them and blow dust all over the house despite supposedly being called HEPA certified?  
I really have no idea as it could not be a question of money.  Do you think people in the U.S. clamor for a heavy, loud, polluting machine where parts fall off?  It is only when they try a Miele (or equivalent European brand) that they gush with excitement about how wonderful it is.  The other side of this happiness is obviously their annoyance of their past experiences which we can guess was a Hoover or Eureka.  I am angry that not all vacuums are made this way.

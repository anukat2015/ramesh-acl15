Title: I wish I hadn't bought this
Content:
It's fast and has a large memory.  It DOESN'T have a Bluetooth transceiver so you need to plug in a separate device for devices.  Sometimes the video driver crashes and flickers.  The physical plastic covering cracks easily and the softkeys (the lit up buttons just below the screen are stuck).

Title: Great little coffeemaker!
Content:
I purchased this little gem when I was on an extended stay at a friends house where they didn't drink coffee. It was inexpensive and brewed 2-4 cups which is perfect for one person. I liked this little thing so much I took it home with me. The coffee brewed quickly, tasted good and was decently warm. 
The only problems were finding the correct size filters since the 8-10 cup filters bunch up and cause a mess. I would buy a couple of bundles of filters at a time when I found them. The other problem was that the digital timer lost time. It seemed to fall about 10 minutes behind each day so after a week it was totally off! 
When my fiance and I moved in together, we shared this appliance in our small apartment where it's compact size was perfect for our micro-kitchen. It was also easy to store on a shelf when not in use. 
I bought this in Aug/Sep 2005 and then yesterday it just stopped working for no apparent reason. I definitely feel I got more than my money's worth out of it but we are now buying a 10 cup coffee maker anyway.

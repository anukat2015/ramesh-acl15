Title: My second Euro-Pro Lightweight Vacuum
Content:
This is the best little vacuum I have ever purchased. I had the first one (a different style but same mfg)
for 8 years and keep it in the garage for cleaning the car and the new one stays in the house. It makes
cleaning up small messes simple and fast and is great for getting around the corners and edges where my
big Kirby doesn't reach.  I use it on smooth floors instead of stirring up dust with the broom.

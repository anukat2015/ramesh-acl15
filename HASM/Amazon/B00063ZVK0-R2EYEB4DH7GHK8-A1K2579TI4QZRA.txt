Title: Best!
Content:
This heater is a quiet, no hot spot, plastic-enclosed safe heater.  It is designed for, and works best in, relatively mild climates or for making a single room more comfortable.  If your nighttime temps regularly drop below 30 degrees, this is not the heater for you, unless it is used as a single room backup.  If you live in a climate like I do, San Francisco, where low temperatures are frequent but of minimal duration, this heater is perfect.  To expect a relatively low-wattage appliance to heat your entire home to 75 degrees from 35 degrees in 20 minutes is ridiculous.

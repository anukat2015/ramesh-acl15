Title: finally, a good vacuum
Content:
My vac arrived in a timely fashion and in brand new condition (as described).  I'm very happy w/it, although my hubby hates canister vacs.  However, I've had nothing but bad luck w/all of the uprights that I've purchased.  This vacuum handles easily and cleans well-but I must admit I don't use it very often-my weekly cleaners do.  I have been pleased w/it the times that I have had to use it though.

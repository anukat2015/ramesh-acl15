Title: Extremely happy with this Coffee Maker!
Content:
The reviews for this Black & Decker coffee maker are all over the place, and I don't get it.  This machine is just as good as it says on it's box.  
The carafe is called "Perfect Pour" and I do agree with that.  I specifically wanted a machine with a decent pot that didn't spill all over the place.  You can pour easily and quickly without spilling a drop.  And I didn't think it was difficult to fill the machine either: another great experience, without having to mop up the whole countertop after it was filled!!  (We bought a cheap CoffeeMate machine a few months ago but it made such a mess I couldn't stand it anymore. )
I like the "Blue Glow" control panel on this Black & Decker model. It's like a nightlight in the dark. It's easy to figure out the controls, too. 
The reusable coffee filter is great.  I'm glad to see these are making a comeback. I always did like them.  The paper filters tend to fold down while the coffee is brewing and then you have grounds in your coffee.  But that doesn't happen with the permanent filter. 
The machine comes with a strange dipping stick with a basket on the end - and no explanation.  My brother figured out it's a charcoal filter that helps improve the flavor of the water, apparently.  I don't know where we are supposed to put it however.  In the water reservoir? Do we stir it around in the water before we put it in the machine? That part is a mystery. It's probably a good idea but instructions would be nice. :) 
Yes, I love this coffee maker.  I bought it March 2010, and this is apparently the most recent model there is.  Perhaps some of the earlier models of this design had some flaws, but I don't see any problems with it now.

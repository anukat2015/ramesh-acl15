Title: Malfunctioned on the second use
Content:
We purchased this item from another retailer last week. I used it the first time and I wasn't impressed but content (for the reason outlined below). Then, my wife tried to use it and the rotating brush wouldn't turn on. We repeated tried to turn on the rotating brush using the switch on the handle to no avail. Then I banged the head then pressed the switch and it turned on. 
Pros:
- bagless. I wanted a bagless canister since my last one used S bags that cost me $3 a bag.
- compact and light
Cons:
- The brush is weak. Compared to my kenmore canister, this brush is slight and lacks rotating power. I tried to feel the suction and it was weak too. That said, it was still picking up dirt. So I don't know whether Hoover found a way to pick up dirt while making the suction and brush weaker than normal.
- It malfunctioned on the second use.

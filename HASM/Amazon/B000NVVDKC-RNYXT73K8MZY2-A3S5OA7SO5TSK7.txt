Title: Best Camera for the price!
Content:
I did a 3 months research before I bought the E510. I don't regret my choice. It is an excellent camera with excellent kit of lens. I just bought the Zuiko 70-300 to complete the kit. I read a review that says someone had some water damage in the camera. I live in Miami and took mine to the Everglades several times, plus to a boat trip last week. I had no problems at all. 
I take photography classes and everybody in the class has either a canon or a nikon. We have to enlarge our pictures to 12x18 to show them in class for appreciation and my pics have an amazing quality. Teacher and classmates have beeing impressed.I carry a much lighter equipment than my colleagues when we walk for hours in our shooting classes in the Everglades. If you buy this camera you won't go wrong.

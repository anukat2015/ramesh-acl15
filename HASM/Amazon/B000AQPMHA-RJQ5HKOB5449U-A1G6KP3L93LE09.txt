Title: Works but NOISY
Content:
This is my second Keurig brewer -- I love K-cups for fresh coffee and tea. My other Keurig brewer was purchased several years back and is a Ultra model B50. Still working like a top! This one works just as well and I really like the revised cup sizes on this newer model. But relatively speaking the new one is VERY VERY VERY NOISY when the machine takes draws the next amount of water into the heating chamber. Placing it on a soft surface makes no difference in the amount of noise.

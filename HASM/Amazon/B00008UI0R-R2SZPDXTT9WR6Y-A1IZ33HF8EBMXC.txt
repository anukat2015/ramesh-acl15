Title: best vacuum ever!!! Love It!!!
Content:
I love this vacuum cleaner. It is light and easy to use. It keeps my rugs looking great. I have 2 labs that are shedding and all of their hair is readily picked up. The tool to do the furniture is great and works magnificiently. It's powered by the vacuum cleaner. I actually feel like an advertisement for it. I just have to tell people how great it is. I would say the only down side is cleaning the canister and filter. But I don't mind. It's better, I think, because you don't have a bag of dust mites and allergens sitting in your closet, waiting to be thrown out when the bag is full.

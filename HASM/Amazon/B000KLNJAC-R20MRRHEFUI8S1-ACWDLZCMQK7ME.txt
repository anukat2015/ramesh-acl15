Title: So far so good!
Content:
We purchased this exact same heater locally and we've been using it for about 45 days now. I was discouraged to see someone rated it so low because we are very happy with the heater we purchased. It has preformed beautifully in the time that we've had it.
I will say this though, this is the sixth portable electric heater we've purchased and only a couple of the models have lasted longer than a year. We had a Delong that simply stopped working and I haven't been able to figure out why. 
If this one lasts the entire year, without trouble, I'll be happy.  :)

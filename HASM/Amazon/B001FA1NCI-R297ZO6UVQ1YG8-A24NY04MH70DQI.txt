Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
I've had other MP3 players but this one is a great value.  The menus are easy to navigate, the controls are just as you would expect, and the battery lasts for about 8 hours if you are only listening to music.  If you play the games, the battery drains quickly.   The only feature I did not like is that you cannot charge the unit with the cable that it came with while you listen to the music.  As soon as you plug the ipod to the computer it "docks" it, charges and doesn't let you use the menu.  When you undock it, all is normal again, but the battery doesn't charge.  I purchased an inexpensive wall/car charger that does let you charge and use.  I also bought a silicone skin cover, and a screen protector that I would recommend.  Size is perfect, storage size is great for most users.  8gb is a lot of music!  Price on Amazon was the most competitive, shipping was free and you may also save on state taxes.  The headphones are good and do feel a bit "big" so they don't go into my ears snug but the sound quality is very good.   I would recommend this MP3 player to anyone.  If I lost it or it broke I would definitely buy another.

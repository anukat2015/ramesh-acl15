Title: Think twice before ordering
Content:
I was so excited to upgrade to a higher capacity Zune, so imagine my disappointment when after 3 days of receiving my new, bigger Zune the hard drive failed.  I spent a frustrating hour on the phone with the Zune technicians only to be told the hard drive failed (really?!) and I would have to send it in for repairs.  I was out a month, between shipping it to the repair plant in Texas and having them strap it to a snail's back to return to me when it was fixed.  Not to mention I had just purchased a one month Zune Marketplace pass, which they didn't honor even though I didn't have my Zune for the month it was valid.  
I would seriously encourage anyone to think twice about ordering a Zune, period.  The software is nightmare to navigate and the Zune Marketplace is a joke in my opinion.  When I got my fixed Zune back I signed up again for a Marketplace pass, only to find out that a lot of stuff I had downloaded into my collection before my Zune broke was suddenly no longer available.  It just really isn't worth the money and hassle, because unfortunately this whole thing has been one big headache and expense for me.  I wouldn't do it again.

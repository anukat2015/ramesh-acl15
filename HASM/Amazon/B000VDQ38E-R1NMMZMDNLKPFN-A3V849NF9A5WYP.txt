Title: Good power
Content:
After letting out 10-year-old dinosaur die a slow and painful death I opted for this vacuum.  We have a dog but he isn't much of a shedder but we have 3 kids and live in the country so we have dirt aplenty.  I did have to attach the hose and top part of the handle and stick the attachments on.  It only involved 1 screw and a Phillips screwdriver, no big deal.  After about 5 min it was up and running and its first quick run in the living room produced enough fine dirt to fill the collection cup about 1/2 way full, we had just had the carpets cleaned with a steam cleaner 1 week before.  I was pretty impressed.  It is heavy but has enough power to help propel itself and it is significantly quieter than our old Dirt Devil.  The hose seems long enough for my needs without being cumbersome and the 6 inch turbo brush worked great on my couch picking up junk that collects in there. I have little use for the flip- down pet hair grabber but can see its usefulness though I am unable to comment on its actual effectiveness and the other attachments are designed for long pet hair they have a rubberized coating that I think would grab hair off of furniture. I found this vacuum at my local Wal-Mart for $132.00 so I think the price is reasonable for the product
pro: powerful, 6inch turbo brush
con: heavy

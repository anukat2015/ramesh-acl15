Title: Dolce Gusto or Keurig?  The winner is... Dolce Gusto!
Content:
I deliberated between the Keurig Breville and the Dolce Gusto and, in fact, bought the Keurig before seeing the Dolce Gusto at Sur La Table.  Fortunately, the Keurig never made it's way out of the box.  The Keurig definitely offers the most variety in the coffee line and with a pod adapter you can use your own coffee (I happen to be an illy fan so it originally won me over for that reason alone).  But I was sold after walking into Sur La Table and asking the rep to demonstrate the Dolce Gusto. The Latte Macchiato was delicious and looked and tasted like it came from a local gourmet coffee shop.  Since I'm an occasional latte drinker, the Dolce Gusto turned out to be the perfect machine for me.  The only thing I felt slightly misled about is that the cost per drink is 2x for the drinks requiring a milk capsule because 16 capsules yields 8 drinks for $10/box, which is a lot more than the 25 drinks you get from a box of Keurig pods ($10/box). So the cost of the DG is much higher in the longrun.  But then again, you can't get the specialty coffee drinks from a Keurig. Since my family members typically order the specialty coffee drinks when we're out, we're going to enjoy the Dolce Gusto for sure!!  It's a great machine and looks cool too.  I hope they make one out of stainless steel eventually.

Title: THE TAKE OVER!!!!!
Content:
My Zune is great, Microsoft has done it again...I love the fact that the sound is so great. What sold me is that I didn't have to convert my MP3's to MP4a format etc...I loaded the software, and I was off. Like many of the other reviews the software needs alot of work. 
My Pro's:
1. Great Sound 
2. UP and Down stand for UP and Down, no circle motion to scroll thru you list!!! Thank you!!!!
3. Playlist function allows you to play hours upon hours of music.
4. The radio function Wow this was smart! I have gotten alot of use out of it already!
My Con's:
1. The Battery life as others have reviewed, is somewhat weak, 
however I love that its usb powered, while at work my usb cable goes on and for hours the music bumps.
2. The Software...is kind of tricky to understand. At First!!!
3. The free pass to download music, you have to actually purchase the license to burn the actual files to disc, in case you want to share with others.
4. The Wireless function... 0 use for it now..
All in All this is a great MP3/Wma player, I am having a ball with this thing. If you want an alternative to the IPOD, you will not go wrong with this!!!MICROSTRONG IS COMING FOR YOU APPLE!!!! THE TAKE OVER!!!!

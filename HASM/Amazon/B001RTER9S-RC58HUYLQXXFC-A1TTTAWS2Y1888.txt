Title: Great portable air conditioner!
Content:
Though much larger than a window version, this unit, shaped like the penguin after which it's named, allows for the cooling of individual  rooms on demand, rather than wasteful central air. Just like the gas heating stove I installed in the room I use most, I can close off the same room and cool it down for a fraction of the cost of full house cooling.The filered air is an elixir on those uncomfortable days. Sometimes I turn it on for a while, at a higher temperature, just to get some filtered air in a stuffy room.
Well worth the price. When once of the venting parts arrived broken, a friendly customer service person sent me a replacement within a few days.

Title: Good, but controls are awful
Content:
(-)
...what was Creative thinking about when it designed the controls for the unit; not just to say they are invisible in the dark, it is hard to operate them in general - why are they so small?!. 
(-)
The WiFi function is not that important - I would not even offer one and keep the price lower, or instead invest in supporting DivX playback
(-)
limitted or No DivX playback.
(-)
The screen cannot be turned off completely during blayback - wasting the battery resources
(-)
Bookmarks do not recall the position of the track in the album - making audio books listening difficult.
(+)
X-Fi does work

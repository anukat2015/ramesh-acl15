Title: Everything you need , NOT
Content:
When i first tested out this vacuum, i have been satisfied with pretty much everything, about it, the button, the features, ease to use, and empty container.
since i have been very exited about it, i left it plugged in the electrical outlet, after 30 minutes, i tried to turn in on, and it wouldn't, then i tried to clean the filter, and oblivously the power was down, i quickly referred to user manual, about some kind of circuit breaker, they said there was one on the brush, but it didn't do a thing, 
with the small letters in the manual it was written "not leave vacuum plugged in when not in use"
i mean how stupid, they thought of everything, but the the thing that would commonly happen, maybe i got a defective unit i don't know, this vacuum goes back, i have being using electrolux products for over 15 years, and they have been great, but this.
I don't think these days saying "what you pay, is what you get" actually works anymore.

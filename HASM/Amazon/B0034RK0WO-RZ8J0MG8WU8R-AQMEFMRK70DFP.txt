Title: A wonderful computer for the price!
Content:
After exhaustive research, I decided the Toshiba Cosmio x505-870 powerhouse had the best specs for the best price. This was the next in a long line of Toshiba laptops for me. I was hooked after my first one about 10 years ago. Due to the design, durability, price, and support, Toshibas have always been my first choice and I would, and do, recommend them to everyone that asks. The Cosmio X505-870 is my new passion. My only complaints are minor and cosmetic. The slick surface of the keyboard and the awkward multimedia and power buttons are the only hindrances I have found. The new, positive design elements far outway the problems though. The toned-down color scheme, the disable button for the touchpad, and the beautiful 18.4 screen(although not full 1080p) to name a few. There were some issues with the BIOS that Toshiba addressed directly, so I would suggest updating the BIOS immediatly after creating your restore disks. I don't think it would be possible to regret the purcase of this system, and I recommend it whole-heartidly.

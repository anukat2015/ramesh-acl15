Title: Why spend more
Content:
Why buy a bigger computer? I have had this computer for 4 days and boy is it hot! I am not much of a gamer but Avatar is fantastic. This game runs flawlessly with all the bars to the max while browsing on the internet with Delphi 6 running in the back ground. Blu-Ray movies look so good that I will carry this ASUS anytime I have to make a trip or go camping this summer. Lite Scribe was a pleasant surprise.
Pros                                                                                       Fast, Looks Nice, Very sharp graphics lots of memory Ability to extend memory with a flash drive or SD
Cons                                                                                       Yes it do get hot especially at the exhaust port get a cooler

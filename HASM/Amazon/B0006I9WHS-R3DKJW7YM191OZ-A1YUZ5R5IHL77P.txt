Title: Good, efficient heater, but a little noisy
Content:
I bought this heater for my office, which being in an old turn-of-the-century building tends to have a hard time staying warm in Winter.  I've got a few Honeywell air purifiers at home working, so I stuck with this manufacturer for this purchase.  I'm glad I did.  PROS: it heats my office (10x15) quickly and maintains the desired temperature; controls are easy to use; it's small and easily placed out of the way.  CONS:  the fan is a little noisy; wish it came in black like most of the other appliances and items in my office.  I'd recommend this little space heater for anyone with similiar needs.

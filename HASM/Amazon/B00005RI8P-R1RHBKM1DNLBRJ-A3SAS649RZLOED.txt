Title: 500 MHz ibook
Content:
I bought a 500 MHz ibook.While it's true that the 10 GB model does fill up rather quickly - be realistic - a laptop is a toy, unless you're truly using it as a total desktop replacement.  I actually do more of my daily work on my ibook now than my regular Pentium 4 station - and that's a good thing.  My ibook rocks..  now I just need an ipod.  Granted, you will need to up the ram.  I'm maxing mine out at 640 MB.  I read one reviewer saying it was hard to exchange files between PC's & Macs...  but exchanging files between pc & mac platforms isn't hard.  Some programs haven't come to mac yet, but I seem to like the programs that mac has better - for example, itunes rules...Anyway, I'm not gonna ramble anymore - just face the facts.  Apple builds an excellent laptop (it's really eye-catching, and sturdy), and when you compare the two, there's no reason to get a PC laptop, in my view (though tons of people still do).  :)

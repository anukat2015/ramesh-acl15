Title: This thing really cleans!
Content:
I've had a Dyson for the past 5 years. After owning my Miele for a week I've been shocked about how much dirt the Dyson had been leaving behind. My hardwood floors and area rugs have never looked cleaner... and that's saying something as I'm a clean freak with 3 kids and I vacuum everyday. The powerbrush feature is a must. Without it it's not worth having. It made one of my old rugs look brand new and the brush head itself works great on hardwood floors (with the powerbrush function turned to off for floors). The other attachments are also great for cleaning curtains, ceilings, baseboards, etc. If your home is mostly hardwood floors and you've owned an upright previously you'll wish you'd purchased a canister vacuum long ago. 
This vacuum didn't get 5 stars from me because of the cord length. It boasts and extra long cord which makes me wonder what on earth the regular cord must be like. I had to unplug and replug my Dyson 2-3 times to clean the downstairs floor of my house. I have to unplug and replug the Miele 7-8 times! I find this so irritating that I took off a star, and almost took of 2 stars. 
I honestly don't know if it is worth $600 or the heart attack my husband had when he opened up my Amex bill. Not having had a chance to compare it to a less expensive machine I can't be sure. I am however a vacuum cleaner fanatic and in my experience you get what you pay for.

Title: Delightful  D40
Content:
I purchased this camera for my daughter to use in her photography class. This is a great entry level camera that is light in weight and easy to use. The quality of the photographs are remarkable. I also purchased a  Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens, that I recommend highly as well.

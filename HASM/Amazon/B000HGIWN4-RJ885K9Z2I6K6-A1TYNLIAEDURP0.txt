Title: Very Happy
Content:
I researched the Canon EOS 450D and the Nikon D80 for quite some time. All the reviews for both cameras were very positive (making it even more difficult to choose.) Finally decided on the Canon because of the updated feature set and the higher resolution. After checking a few stores, I finally was able to put an incoming camera on hold (with a down payment) at my local Circuit City. After three day's of use, I ended up returning it for the Nikon D80; don't get me wrong, the Canon was a lovely camera but for me it came down to the ergonomics and build quality. Before buying the Canon, a photographer friend who uses all Nikon's commented that both cameras are good cameras but the Nikon could be likened to a Mercedes and the Canon a BMW (no offense to BMW's of course). At the time, I had no clue what he meant, but after using the Canon, and previously demoing the Nikon, I knew what he meant. The Canon's hand grip and significantly lighter weight were uncomfortable for me. The included kit lens (although stabilized) also left much to be desired. Although subjective, the build quality, weight, and ergonomics (button placement, feel, and additional external LCD screen) of the Nikon D80 are very pleasing.
In the end, I think anyone interested in either camera should do like the reviews say and try them out to see which feels better, something that I wasn't able to do as the newness of the Canon did not lend to the stores wanting to even open a box for me to compare. I think anyone would be happy with either, but for me, I'm very happy that Circuit City's exchange program allowed me to exchange, no regrets with the D80 - I love it!

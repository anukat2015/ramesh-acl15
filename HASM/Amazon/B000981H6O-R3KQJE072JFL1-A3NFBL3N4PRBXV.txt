Title: Does what I purchased it for
Content:
I purchased this little hand vacumn for quick clean-ups around the house--grass and outside stuff that gets tracked inside, as well as around the kitty litter box, in corners where dust collect, in front of the fireplace, etc.  It does all of these very well.  My only negative comment is that it does blow dust when you are in tight spots.
I would recommend it highly and would purchase it again.  The shipping was fast as well.

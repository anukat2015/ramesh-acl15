Title: Pros and Cons
Content:
Please note that I just got this machine yesterday.  Today I used the espresso side and the coffee side.  The review I am giving is based on these uses only.
First of all, this is one nice looking machine.  I love how it looks on my counter, and I really like the fact that the frother can be tucked in when not in use.  
When the machine came out of the box, there was a very strong smell of plastic.  I immediately put every removable piece through the dishwasher.  I was worried, but NO there was NO plastic taste to anything that I made.
Some things about the espresso side that I was very very pleased with:  the frother worked very well, moreso than with other Mr. Coffee machines I have used in the past.  The lid to the carafe was a rubbery material rather than hard plastic, which is good because with my last machine I had a problem with the lid falling into the carafe.  I made a great cappuccino in a very short period of time.  I will agree with other reviewers that it was warm rather than hot, but I don't anticipate this being a problem.
Now, I read the reviews stating that the coffee pot leaks from the lid when pouring, but it was not in my mind when I was pouring my first cup.  It leaked in a horrible way, all over my countertop.  I really hope it isn't hard to remember to hold the top open.  Luckily, I only make coffee when I have company over...  it is the espresso side that I will personally use every day.
I think that the sheer sexiness of this machine makes it a keeper, and for a coffee pot and espresso machine in one, it wasn't a bad price.  I don't HIGHLY recommend it, but I wouldn't recommend against it, either.

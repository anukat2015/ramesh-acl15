Title: excellent
Content:
Bought this laptop 1 month ago, cant complain about it. Config is awesome, nice processor, good for multitasking, 500gb hd is great, and the video card(main reason i choose this laptop) runs modern warfare 2 on high, with no lags. The laptop looks great, and the keyboard(which is a copy of the on in the macbook) is way better than the regular ones.
Pros: nice HD, great video card, good keyboard, nice av controls.
Cons: No blueray(not an issue for me).

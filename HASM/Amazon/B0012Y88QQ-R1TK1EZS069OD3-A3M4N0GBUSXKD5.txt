Title: Amazon was best value
Content:
We purchased this after comparing it to the Nikon D60.  It is a little more expensive, but seems to be of higher quality and feels better to hold.  Quality of build so far is pretty good and its use is pretty intuitive.  So far, no issues to report on negatively.

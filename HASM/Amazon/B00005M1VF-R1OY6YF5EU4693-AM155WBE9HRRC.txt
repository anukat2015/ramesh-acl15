Title: convenient and reliable little coffeemaker
Content:
We've had this coffeemaker for about 10 years and use it daily (more than once, often several times) and it is still going strong!  It's great for having fresh coffee at any time.  My husband will not drink coffee that's been sitting around on a hotplate, and since we drink different types of coffee, this machine is great because we just make it separately.  We do have a smaller one-cup coffeemaker, but since we use travel mugs a lot we prefer this one.  Our regular coffeemaker gets used only when we have company.
I was surprised by all the negative reviews as our on-off button has never been a problem, we've brewed coffee into all kinds of mugs and cups without difficulty, and it always comes out tasting good.  However, I can't comment on the uneven distribution of coffee between two cups since we tend to make one at a time.  If that happened you'd have to be there during brewing and remove the cup that filled first and push the other to the center, which would be inconvenient.
For our purposes, this coffeemaker is great.

Title: Agitator belt problems
Content:
Agitator belt broke once, came off three times in eight months use. Quite a nuisance to disassemble to fix this. Local vacuum cleaner repair shop,(very experienced mechanic), said this was a frequent problem with this model but was good for his business. Advised that only way to avoid this is to operate at much less than this model's powerful full suction especially on rugs. Very disappointing since my wife is now reluctant to use the cleaner since she knows it will happen again - and won't let me even touch it! We bought this because our old Hoover lasted 14 years with no problems!

Title: Extremely capable, Great 1st DSLR
Content:
This is just what I wanted.  It's not complicated, but very capable.  Still far beyond my current capabilities, but between the camera and the Dummies book by Julie Adair King, I am taking noticeably better photos already.  I am going to get a lot of use out of this camera, and the more I learn, the more impressed I am with it.  Not having video is not a negative for me.  It's a great camera for still images and that's what I want it to do.  I bought a $150 HD flip camera for video.  If you are deciding between brands, the others are probably really good too.  But I am thoroughly happy with what I chose, and I did not spend way too much.  If you are coming from a point and shoot like I was, this is a great choice.

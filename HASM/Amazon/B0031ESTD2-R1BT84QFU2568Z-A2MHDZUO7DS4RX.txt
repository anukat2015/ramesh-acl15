Title: Summary of this monster!
Content:
I've had this laptop for about a week now, and I love it!  I love the apperence, but the mouse cicker is a finger print holder, so i wipe it like everyday.  This lsptop is a perfect size to, small but perfect, not to small.  The built in cam and mic is great because I do a lot of traveling, so Skype rocks!
Now this laptop is fast, at everyday uses.  But I don't do anything major, im a student, so Microsoft Office, and just web browsing.  
I do alsso use this laptop for personal stuff.  I have Itunes, the Itunes store runs slow, but everything else is good.  I was suprised how loud the speaker was.  It isn't blasing but its perfect.  The glossy screen isn't much of a problem.  The battery lasted for me about 4-5 hours denpending on what I'm doing.  I do alot, im a geek.  
But i sure would recremand this to someone, it's a great laptop for it's price.  For the memory of this, I don't download stuff often, so I hven't had to upgrade yet. 
Windows 7 makes this laptop the best!
It is just such a nice laptop.

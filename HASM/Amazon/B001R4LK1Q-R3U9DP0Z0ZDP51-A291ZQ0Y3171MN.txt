Title: Not as pleased with newer improved (?) version
Content:
Like the looks but coffee doesn't always make it into the cup when being dispensed. Coffee pours to close to the side and down the front with many of my cups, which no doubt is why the bottom tray is bigger and deeper than before. Would like for the red light to go off or indicate green when coffee is ready. Beep is too low if not beside it to hear when the coffee is ready.

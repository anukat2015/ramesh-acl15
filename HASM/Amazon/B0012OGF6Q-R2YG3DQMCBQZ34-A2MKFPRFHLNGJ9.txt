Title: A truly great DSLR
Content:
This is a wonderful camera. I've had it for almost a year now and have used it from New Orleans to San Francisco. The stock lens is a great lens to start out with and takes wonderful pictures. Compared the the 80 or higher it has fewer options when concerning quality of the pictures taken. This is a great camera to start with and with the right lenses a great one to even build on. I highly recommend this camera to those that wish to begin photography and like to catch those moments that are often missed by digital cameras.

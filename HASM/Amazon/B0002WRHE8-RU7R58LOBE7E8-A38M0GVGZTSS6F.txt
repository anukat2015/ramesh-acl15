Title: my Big Buddy
Content:
I received my Big Buddy for Christmas 06 from my Dad.  I've used it extensively at meets and wouldn't be without it.  I called Mr Heater to find out which hose connection was the best for using a bbq tank and was told to use the hose that snaps onto the connector on the left side of the heater. This thing rocks!

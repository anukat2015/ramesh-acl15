Title: lacking critical features, robustness
Content:
Great stills quality. Good ISO (but not excellent like the D700 or D3)
HD video mode sounds enticing but is practically unusable for pros/artists who demand precise control of the camera gear.
Is this camera built to shoot home videos? or for creative professionals? Please take away the Full Automatic video mode and give us control over aperture and shutter speed and ISO!

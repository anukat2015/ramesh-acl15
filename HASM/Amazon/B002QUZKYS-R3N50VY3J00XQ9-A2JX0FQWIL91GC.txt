Title: best computer I've had
Content:
I must have owned at least 50 computers (about 8 laptops) by now and this is an example of how they just keep getting better. 
They display is improved and really gives color and sharpness to your drab old photos. The large square keyboard keys are a joy to type on. Mousepad takes some getting used to since you have to use the left side since the right is reserved for (new W 7) pinching etc. But there is a key to disable the pad (and then use a USB mouse)
The unit stays remarkably cool and the battery lasts 3.5-4.5 hrs (I think)
Seems to pick up more wireless signals and stronger
Incidently the notebook has 4 usb inputs! - 2 on each side!
Volume + and - keys are nice when watching DVD's
It doesn't have built in bluetooth but evidently another model must because it has a (disbled) bluetooth on off key
It comes in a small box with just the battery and charger and very little literature (most is loaded on the hard disk and available online. good - less clutter
I made the single repair disk but haven't done the big 5 disk image. I also deleted MacAfee
Windows 7 seems amazingly solid and simple. By far microsoft's best effort. It eliminates a lot of clicks. Features a dedicated show desktop hover click in lower right. Simplifications abound. After a while you seem to forget how easy everything is to do without losing the way you have done thing for a long time. You can think more about what you are doing and not on how to get the computer there
So far only one problem with Win 7 (perhaps my recent update fixed it) is that the desktop has twice lost icons I have placed there

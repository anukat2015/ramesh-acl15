Title: works great after 2 years!
Content:
I LOVE COFFEE.  Fix that - I love GOOD coffee.
I used to have a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker for about 10 yrs, & it finally died.  So, I bought another one.  They didn't have the same one anymore, so I bought the one most similar to what I had.  Ugh... it made the WORST coffee.  It was all watery, & if you tried to compensate by adding more grounds, or making the grind just a bit finer, it would clog up, & overspill from the top.
So, I gave that replacement Mr. Coffee coffeemaker away.  I woulda paid for someone to take it, really.  I'd rather go without coffee than to have to look at the sad excuse for a coffeemaker.
I was complaining about my lack of coffee at brunch one Sunday, & my dear friend said her sis just got this DeLonghi coffeemaker as a gift from her job, & didn't need it.  So, they gave it to me.
I've had this for over 2 yrs now, & I LOVE this DeLonghi coffeemaker.  I haven't used the programmable function yet, but love that I can if I wanted to.  Love that it shuts itself off in 2 hrs, b/c everyone forgets to turn it off every now & then.
I LOVE the brew select button.  It DOES make the difference.  I can actually taste the difference if I use it or not (stronger cup if you use it; or I won't use it if I'm making for company who don't want the stronger cup).
Bottom line.....  IT MAKES GREAT COFFEE.  My coffee tastes better than ANY coffee-house coffee I've ever had!  Isn't good coffee really all you want from a coffee maker?

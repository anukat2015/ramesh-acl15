Title: Not very reliable
Content:
I have a German Shepherd so I thought this might be a good vacuum for my carpets.  The first few days I was fairly happy with it.  I've now had it for about 6 months.  I've had to replace the belt five times.  After speaking with repair people I've come to the conclusion that the belts were put on properly and that it's something with the design of the vacuum.  
Not only do the belts constantly break down, but the machine doesn't do a very good job to begin with.  I have a small area rug that is black, so you can really see how much hair is on it.  I can never get the hair off of it.  I've tried everything.  It just doesn't come clean like it has with other vacuums.  
The lint brush in front is totally useless.  It just prevents me from being able to vacuum all the way up to the walls.  
The attachments are decent, though.  I've had more success hooking them up to my shop-vac, though, than with the vacuum.  
All in all, this vacuum has made me very frustrated, sick of spending ages trying to get hair off of carpets and sick of replacing belts.

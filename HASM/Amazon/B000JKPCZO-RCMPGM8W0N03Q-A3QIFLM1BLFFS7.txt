Title: Worth the extra $$$
Content:
I hate to vacuum and for years used lower-priced models, which I found noisy and awkward to use. Then I tested the Sebo K2 and was instantly hooked. Its powerful suction gets the job done quickly and it's highly efficient, but what I love most about it is its ease of operation and quietness. It's so quiet my cat doesn't even wake up. The best way I can describe it is think of a Rolls Royce compared to a  Lada. Who knows? I might even start to like vacuuming........The only reason I haven't given this dream machine 5 stars is because after all, it is  pricey and you should get what you pay for and I think the power cord's a bit too short

Title: Same as i-pod Nano, but way cheaper.
Content:
Nice thing about Zunes is that they're pretty much the same as i pods, they're just always cheaper.  The Zune does have what the i pod doesn't.  Zune has radio and Social network.  Sound quality is nice with really good ear buds.  The battery life is only okay, but that is only for this model of Zune.  The bigger Zunes have longer battery.  The video quality is great.  And since the Zune Marketplace sells video now, so you can use that to its full potential.  It only comes with 5 games and you can't get more, but Microsoft will more than likely add more later.  Overall it's awesome, and the other Zunes are even better.

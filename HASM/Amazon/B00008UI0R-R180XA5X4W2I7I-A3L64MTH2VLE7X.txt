Title: SO IMPRESSIVE EVEN MY 16 YR. OLD  WANTED A TRY...
Content:
Slick modern look, but who even cares about that when so much power is packed into such a lightweight unit.  I no longer wanted the clumsy uprights but was hesitant about the weight that would probably be needed for an effective canister.  No problem with this featherweight, and the quick release, easy disposal dirt cup just keeps everything at a maximum effectiveness.  You can control the suction as you go which makes it easier to keep fringe on area rugs from getting caught.  I hope it is as durable as it is effective; it will be hard to go back to any other type of vacuum.

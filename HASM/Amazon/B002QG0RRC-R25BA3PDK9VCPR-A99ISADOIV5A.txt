Title: Junk!  Would make great coffee, if it would only work
Content:
Purchased this machine on November 25 and it made absolutely amazing coffee over the Thanksgiving weekend.  On December 1 we woke up to beans in the basket but the water did not brew.  Tried again with no luck.  We called Capresso customer service and they immediately sent out a replacement that we received on December 4.  Well, the new one brewed water and would grind beans, put would not open the path for the beans to dump in the basket.  0 for 2 and no way I am going to go 0 for 3.  Eliminate frustration and look elsewhere for a coffee maker, this one is not ready for primetime.  Which is a shame because the 6 pots of coffee it did make were absolutely fabulous.

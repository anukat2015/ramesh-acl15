Title: H.P. Pavilion excellent choicel
Content:
I'm still a satisfied Toshiba customer. However, after carefully researching specs and reviews of other choices, the HP Pavilion was the best buy. HP Pavilion DV4-2161NR 14.1-Inch Laptop (Black) Faster RAM (DDR3), huge Hard Drive (500 GIG), and a 2.13 Processor.  The cost was a little more than I planned, but the trade off for satisfaction will be worth it.  The only issues has been the 64 bit OS.  Although not the fault of the computer, I haven't been successful in getting Microsoft 2003 Office suite to load. My only concern was when Norton's was doing some maintenance the hard drive was quite noisy.  Other than that it runs quiet.  I haven't tested the burning features.  Although my experience on cam-coders is limited, camera quality appears above average.  Sound is impressive and the ability to adjust the sound by touching a lighted control is a great feature.  You can turn off the wireless with a simple touch also.  Battery life is only fair. Over all this is a outstanding laptop with desk top features.

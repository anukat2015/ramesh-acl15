Title: Great handy vac - and kids offer to help!
Content:
Picked this item up as I was tired of hunching over with my cordless hand vac to pick up daily dirt off of my hardwood floors - grass clippings, dog hair, small dirt & crumbs, etc.  It works great, it handles big spaces and the biggest benefit?  The kids (ages 5 and 3!) fight over who gets to vacuum because of it's super-rolly, neato, easy to use design.

Title: you'll like this camera
Content:
This camera is really good.  The lens that it comes with provides clear pictures.  I'm an amature photographer and i'm really still trying to learn how to fully use it and i learn  things every time i use it.  I still can't get over the quality of the photos that come out of this camera.  I went boating with friends not to long after I got it and I was taking pictures of them tubing and 99.9% of them came out looking beautiful.  I even took a video with the camera and even with the bumpyness of the boat the video was awesome and it captured the sound of everyone on board.  If your looking for a awesome camera for the money this is your camera.

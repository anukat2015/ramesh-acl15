Title: Note to Krups:  head back to the drawing board!
Content:
I've used Krups products for years and when my last espresso machine, a Krups Novo (it was 15 years old) finally bit the dust, I trusted Krups for a new one. Well, this XP may feel like a solid unit however, its out-put is certainly not. This unit is noisy, the frothing is a joke, and the the coffee is less than ideal. 
I don't know what that company did, but this unit stinks.  I now have the agonizing task of trying to return this.  Don't buy it!

Title: love it!
Content:
This is such a great vacuum! I initially bought a dyson but returned it as it wasn't worth the money. This vacuum is so much more than expected! I did fill a bag on my first vacuuming of the entire house. Now that it thoroughly cleaned the carpet,  I have vacuumed the house several times and the bag is still not full. I don't think the small bag will be an issue at all. The carpets look new and the floor is clean as well. The cord isn't the longest, but the automatic cord rewind more than makes up for it.

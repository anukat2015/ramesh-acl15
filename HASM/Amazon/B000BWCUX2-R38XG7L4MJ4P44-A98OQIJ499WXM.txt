Title: The best vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
First of all, I've never bought into the notion that a pricey vacuum does any better job than a less expensive Hoover.  Until now.  I did my research and checked Consumer Reports.org extensively before forking over big $$$ for this Bosch.  It is worth ever nickel.  It's quiet, does an excellent job on all floor types and is extremely easy to maneuver compared to my old Hoover wind tunnels.  If you have the cash, I HIGHLY recommend it as a good investment.

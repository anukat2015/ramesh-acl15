Title: Too noisy for baby's room
Content:
This heater makes rather loud clicks at seemingly random times.  Not sure if it has or will wake up baby, but I'm not about to take any chances, he is not a good sleeper as it is.  Plus, the clicks get amplified over our monitor and wake us up.  I think I will try the "eco-heater" next. 
Addendum: Well, we kept this heater for the baby's room.  The loud clicking has subsided for the most part, and it does work well, and is compact.  When it does click or creak, it does not seem to wake him up.  Also, it seems to be more stable than the taller versions.

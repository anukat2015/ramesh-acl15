Title: First Mac - Loving it!
Content:
This is my first Mac. I had almost no Mac experience prior to this computer. I love it! 
Really fast set up and start up unlike Windows.
The track pad has so many functions - scroll, zoom in, zoom out, left and right click, switch program, etc.
The aluminum case is really solid (except my friend accidentally dropped his luggage and his Macbook was inside and it made a small dent...still works perfectly). 
Battery life on this is great so far! If you are using the laptop and charging the battery it will take a while but once fully charged it's 2+ hours.
You can connect to other MacBooks via Bluetooth. Easy to connect but it's slow to transfer large files.
The only con I can think of as a first time Mac owner is that I am still learning all the different commands. And now that I'm used to using my Mac I press the wrong buttons when I'm using Windows. I am also having trouble using the same button functions/commands in Microsoft Excel :(
It's a great deal from Amazon (no shipping, no tax) and it was delivered about 2 - 3 days after I ordered it.

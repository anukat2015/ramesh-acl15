Title: great option for runners
Content:
yes, the MZ-S1 is heavier than most newer MD players.  and yes, it's pretty bulky.  but if what you want is a functional player to carry with you while you run, this is a great product.  once you figure out how to use the strap, you can run without clinging to the player-- it feels very natural in your hand.  contrary to what other reviewers have said, i find using the joystick controller very natural; it's great to be able to control volume without feeling for the remote, or for a dial somewhere on the player.  also, it NEVER skips.  the player i used to run with was slightly smaller but less sturdy, and i had to spend way too much time worrying about holding my arm steady in order to keep it from skipping.[note:  i have not (and will not-- i use another program that works fine) used the software that comes with the player, so i can't comment on it.  i also never use the headphones that come with audio equipment, so i can't comment on them, either.]

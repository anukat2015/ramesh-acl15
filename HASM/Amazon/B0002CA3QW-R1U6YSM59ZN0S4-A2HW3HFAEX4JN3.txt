Title: Awesome Coffee Maker
Content:
This is the BEST coffee maker I've ever owned. The pot keeps the water warm ALL day. I was amazed. There's a changeable filter that makes the water taste funny the first few times, but it ends up getting better after the 2 to 3d use. I haven't used the cups yet because I'm so pleased with the carafe's performance. I'm sure they will be equally as good. The programming feature is a time saver if your husband remembers to turn it on that is. :)
Anyway, this thing is great and I would recommend it to anyone!

Title: Just a few flaws
Content:
This is a good vacuum cleaner, but it has a few flaws that prevent me from giving it five stars.
(1) The handle is flimsy.
(2) The dirt cup is way too small. You have to empty it all the time.
(3) The upright segment tends to tip over easily as you pull it around.
(4) It really needs the optional floor blush to be a complete system. You can order one separately, but to me it should just come with it.
On the plus side, the vacuum has good power and strong suction.

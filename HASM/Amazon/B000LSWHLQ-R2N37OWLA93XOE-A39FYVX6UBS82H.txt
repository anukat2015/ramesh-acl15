Title: Mobile Veterinary Practice
Content:
This unit was purchased as a water heater for surgical procedures and wound care in my ambulance that serves as a mobile veterinary practice treating large & small animals in Maine. Great compact unit that is sturdy and very efficient. Well worth the price.

Title: Very Disappointed!!!!!
Content:
The unit was horrible to install.  The screws are too long as the other reviewers have stated.  The top that "easily" slides off - forget it.  There is no way to slide the top off so we installed it with top on.  We had to use hacksaw to make the screws shorter so they would work.  Now that we finally got it installed the coffee pot leaks between the black plastic and the stainless steel!  Since the incorrect screw length and the leaking coffee pot was reported by another reviewer, I think Black and Decker has a lemon.  It looks so nice installed so I gave it one star.   But if the leaking coffee pot is going to be a problem we will probably return the entire unit and wait like the other reviewer for B&D to release an improved product.

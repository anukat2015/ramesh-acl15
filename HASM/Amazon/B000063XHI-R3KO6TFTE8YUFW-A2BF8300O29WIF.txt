Title: Not brainless ease of use... but superb coffee
Content:
I have owned the MT-500 for about two months and am completely happy with the coffee it is capable of brewing. The water brewing temperature is exactly right on my machine (195 degrees F) and the brew time is OK, if just slightly long (about 5.5 minutes for the full pot of  "10" cups - 1.6 liters). I will admit that it took me a while to find the correct brewing proportion of coffee / water. In the end I use 75 grams of medium roast drip grind for the full pot. If I use any more coffee than this the brew basket will overflow and it makes a mess. SO... be warned that this machine takes a little patience and experimentation to master but the results are outstanding.

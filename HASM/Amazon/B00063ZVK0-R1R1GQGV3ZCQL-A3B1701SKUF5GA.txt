Title: lil' thing works great
Content:
I'll have to say I was a little worried when I opened the package and saw the size. But I plugged it in and in 15 minutes my 15X12 living had no more cold spots(NICE!) I do have a ceiling fan but unless its on medium the air on the floor stays the same and then it's too much wind anyway. the temp would vary 10 degrees from floor to ceiling. But not now. and my legs and feet really feel the difference. I also like the quietness even on high and the fact that the lcd displays actual room temp

Title: Awesome camera for new dSLR users
Content:
For a long while I had the desire to make my pictures "grow up" by taking the step to dSLRs. After much research I decided on the Nikon d60, although all our other cameras are Canon. I have not been disappointed!
The manual helps you learn how to operate the camera on a basic level. I learned how to improve my pictures and use all the features with the help of books from Amazon or Barnes and Noble. Do not rely on the manual to teach you everything. LOL
I have taken thousands of pictures with my camera and continue to improve. I love my d60 and get a thrill each time I put in my hands.

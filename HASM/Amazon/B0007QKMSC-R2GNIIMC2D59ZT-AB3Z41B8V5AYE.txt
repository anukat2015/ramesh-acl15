Title: Great Camera for the money
Content:
I am far from a professional photographer but I think anyone can take great pictures with this camera.  I did alot of research before deciding wether to replace a privious pocket digital with the Rebel and I am glad that I got the Rebel.  The picture quality is great and the fact that the camera is very user friendly is also obviously a major plus.  I've always been one to take and share pic's and most people have noticed the change in quality of the pic's from my old camera to Rebel.  I still havn't used all of the features but have played around with some nighttime photography as well as daylight and indoor and have been very pleased.  Some of the features I don't know that I will ever use but I figure that if I ever decide to pursue them they are there.  The only down side to this camera that I can think of is, if your looking for an pocket size camera then this is not for you.  The Rebel is much bulkier but, in my opinion, the inconvienence is well worth the quality and flexibility that this camera offers you.

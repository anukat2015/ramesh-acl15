Title: BLACK MAGIC!!!
Content:
Wow, The Mrs. purchased this coffee maker for me for my Birthday!  Out of the box this was an easy set-up followed the instructions and had my first pot in approx. 15 minutes.  Don't worry only the first pot takes that long, and from then on it is 1.5 minutes for 4 cups of coffee (makes 10).  My wife has never been a coffee drinker but once we purchased the Bunn she has taken an interest we experiment with many grinded beans, and honestly say that this coffee maker brings the taste of a fine coffee house right to our kitchen.  We read the reviews and talked to the old ladies in the family and they all said purchase the BUNN hands down!  Yes, the water is kept warm all the time for on the demand coffee or hot water so your electric bill may go up a few pennies a day, and honestly this is the only draw back I know of.  I also understand the Customer Service for BUNN to be exceptional from reading other reviews.  Black Magic will be my conclusion regarding this Maker!

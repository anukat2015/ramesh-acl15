Title: Looks nice but is almost useless
Content:
I couldnt figure out why this wasnt in stores but now that I own it I know.  I'd return it if I could simply walk it into a store, but to go through the hassle of mailing it back, I'd rather keep it.  But it is almost useless. It looks nice, you dont have to keep it in a closet, so that is convenient.  I bought it to keep next to the wood stove just to get the dust and ash, pretty low expectations really, Im not even talking about crumbs. And it is almost useless, in the time it takes to finally suck up just some dust and ash I could've lugged out the vacuum cleaner.

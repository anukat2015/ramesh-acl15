Title: a good heater.....worth the money
Content:
This is much better than the standard cigarette-lighter ceramic heaters sold at stores like AutoZone.    For one, it doesn't blow your fuses every hour- the direct hookup to the battery bypasses the fuse grid and installation was fairly easy.
Second the heating element itself is much larger in comparison to the over-the-counter model.   
This worked pretty much as I expected, its no replacement for a heater core of course but takes the edge off freezing temperatures and is a heck of a lot better than having nothing.
The only complication I had was in very cold weather sometimes all the windows would fog up due to the heater, had to keep wiping occasionally.  
Also had a scary experience once where I tried cleaning the windshield on the highway with the fluid button on a really cold day but because the cab was relatively warm but the windshield still cold, the fluid got all icy and I suddenly couldn't see out at all (driving 70mph in traffic, this was a bit of a fright).  Had to pull over and scrape the crud off outside.  watch out for this!

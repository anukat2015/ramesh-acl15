Title: Best place to shop for MP3
Content:
hello folks, I bought this Sandisk clip as my backup. I have the Fuze which I like very much and its use of the scroll wheel. The clip has a up, down, sideways button wheel. Very easy to use. Great for Microsoft compatible computer. Its features is Music, radio & Microphone. The fuze tends to be a bit better for sound but both are good. Enjoy the gift of music. Up the Irons!

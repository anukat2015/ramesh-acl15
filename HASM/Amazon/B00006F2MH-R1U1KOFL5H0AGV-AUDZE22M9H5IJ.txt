Title: I LOATHE this machine
Content:
I had owned the old Grind & Brew (twice!), and my husband thought the new one might be better (we both didn't like the cleaning).  This one is EVEN WORSE.  I completely agree with the other reviewers that it's a true SOB to clean...and the coffee isn't good enough to justify the time spent doing so.  A maid in my own kitchen, indeed!  For the $$ they charge for this piece of junk, Cuisinart really should do some SERIOUS R&D on how to make a Grind & Brew machine that can be dismantled to clean all the crap that gets stuck on the little shelf below and behind the brew basket, not to mention the toxic-looking waste that gums up beneath the grinder.  Gimme my old Grind & Brew ANYDAY!  But, I think I'm going to jump on the vacuum pot bandwagon - America's Test Kitchens said they were great, and that's enough for me!

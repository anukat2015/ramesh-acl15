Title: Olympus E-520, an excellent choice
Content:
I was shopping from my first DSLR and finally settled for the Oly E520 after shortlisting it with Canon XSi [450D] and Sony A300. Some of the features that made me go for it are mentioned below:
- a nice package with 14-42mm and 40-150mm lenses
- the quality of Zuiko lenses [and they are smart to market them as optimized for digital photography]
- SSWF dust removal system [which according to some works the best]
- Live View [XSi and A300 have that too]
- In body Image stabilization, which means that you don't need expensive lenses with stabilization [A300 has in-body stabilization too]
- the camera felt better in hand than the other two 
- the Olympus brand 
- Intuitive Menu 
I have both the CF and xD cards on it. The xD card box has a code that activates Art and 3D feature on the Olympus Master 2 Software. 
For someone who is moving up from the point and shoots, the Oly E-520 is one of the best choices. I have been using it for a week now and everyday I learn something new about it. 
Overall, it's one of the best and I have no hesitation in giving it 5 stars and recommending it highly!!!!

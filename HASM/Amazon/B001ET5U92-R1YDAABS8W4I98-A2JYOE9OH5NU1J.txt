Title: A good option to buy
Content:
I wanted a very good DSLR , looked the D300 and Canon 50D  but I inclined to NIKON .
Then the D90 came to the market and I was a little confused and a couldnt decide betwen both D300 and the D90
The differences are just a few and I can live with out them. The body construction, SD card(D90) instead Compact flash (D300) 11 point for Auto focus instead 50 ...
The price difference allows me to buy an extra battery, memory cards a good caring case, filters, different accessories and in the near future the GPS unit (I'm waiting the releasing from NIKON)
The only difference that bothers me a little is that the D90 grip is a little small for me in comparison from the D300  but besides that everything is fine. For this issue you can buy the Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack, but don't think this will increase the the shoots per second you can take as in the D300, only increases the battery duration and allows you to use AA batteries, also gives you a vertical position shutter button.
Very easy to use and understand ALL the functions and buttons, not complicated menus.
I bought the Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX  (the same that comes with the D300 KIT) instead the one that comes with the with because I wanted a more powerful lens and also I read as this lens  is better quality and believe me IT IS AMAZING
If your are not pro and only want a VERY GOOD DSLR professional style  this is a good and wonderful option, believe me 
You'll no regret

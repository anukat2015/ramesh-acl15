Title: Mini Ipods & functionality
Content:
The Ipod shuffle is much smaller than the nano and in fact a lot of functionality is lost in this mini ipod. However, it is perfect for the younger members of the family or for older people who are not interested or cannot manage technology well. It is very simple to use and the bright colors make it fun to carry around.

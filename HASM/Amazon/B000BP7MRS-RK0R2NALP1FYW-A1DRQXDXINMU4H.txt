Title: Disappointing over previous KF187
Content:
I Purchased the Braun KF590 about 1.5 months ago and am disappointed with this coffee maker over Braun's previous 12 cup Flavor Select model  KF185.
This model looks nice but falls short in certain areas. You have to position the gold filter in the basket just right or the basket will not close all the way. The previous model had a slot that lined the filter up and this model does not. You have to make sure that the Carafe is positioned just right on the warming base or the coffee will run down the back of the coffee Carafe. This is due to the pause lever not being compressed all the way and the coffee builds up in the basket and it does not drain into the Carafe. The filter basket is not secured as well as the previous model and sometimes when you swing it out it will fall off causing a mess with the coffee grounds. This machine also should not be called a 10 cup model either as it really is more like a 6 cup model. This model also does not have the brewing strength adjustment like the Model KF185 had. On the plus side it is compact but also that is why it does not brew as many cups. It seems to brew a good cup of coffee though and it is hot enough. Also the water filter and the gold fllter is the same as the KF185 which helped because i had some of these left over from my KF185. I only paid $44.00 for it or i would be even more disappointed with it. Also i noticed that none of the department stores carry the Braun coffee makers anymore so i wonder if that is because of a lower quality product. I am not sure if i will buy another Braun coffee maker again unless the raise they quality up to what it was.

Title: Sony Alpha 350 DSLR 14.2MP Camera
Content:
I am very pleased with the Sony A-350 DSLR Camera that I purchased on Amazon.com  The camera arrived just two days after purchased.  I am a photography student and this is my second Sony DSLR.  My first was the Sony A-100, also an excellent camera.  The photos that I have taken with the A-350 are outstanding.  I have produced a series of butterfly photos, taken in my flower garden that are selling as fast as I can print and frame them.  The excellent color and detail that is produced by the Sony A-350 is amazing.
I reccomend this camera to anyone who is a serious photographer.  I reccomend also that you purchase it at Amazon.com, because they make sure that you get what you are promised and that you get it delivered quickly.

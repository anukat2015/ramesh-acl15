Title: Great deal for the money
Content:
I got this laptop for $197, but I think even at the regular price of around $350 it's a nice "starter" laptop.  The display is bright and clear (widescreen), the sound is amazing (how do these little speakers put out that sound?), and the "build quality" seems solid and sturdy.  Because it's a single core processor and has limited memory, I wouldn't suggest this computer as a primary system for most people.  It's a great second computer to check email and surf the internet.  I am impressed with the card slot and HDMI out.  It even appears to have a built in modem for those who are still on dial up!  Also happy that it has built-in wireless.  
The specs on the HP site say it's about 7 pounds... feels like more than that to me but I haven't weighed it.  I would NOT want to carry this around as a work laptop on airplanes etc as it's too heavy for travel in my opinion.
Out of the box it was very easy to set up, and so far I am happy with this laptop.

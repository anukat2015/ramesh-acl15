Title: Don't expect to get this in one piece
Content:
Like others have said before me, the Engineer that designed the packaging for this unit needs to go back and get his degree again. This unit arrived with the box falling apart and was delivered upside down because the bottom was falling open. Parts were missing and the unit was broken. 
This is not the type of unit you want to purchase and have delivered across the country.
I called Amazon (In India) and after several calls was able to get them to replace the unit with the Delonghi.

Title: Good Coffee Maker
Content:
I got this for "free" a few years ago from Arrowhead for signing up for Starbucks Coffee delivery. I came back to research different Coffee maker and found these reviews, some of which are hilarious. This machine will not make the coffee taste better or worse than other coffee makers. You need to buy quality coffee beans to get quality coffee. How many people does it take to screw on the lid? Word of advice, turn the lid counter-clockwise slowly until you hear a soft "click", that's where the thread begins.  Slowly turn the lid clockwise, visually confirming the lid is parallel to the top of the carafe. Those who are getting puddles around the carafe instead of inside, and you have confirmed the lid id tightened properly, when you swing the filter holder closed, check to see it has not folded over.  Most of the filters are bigger than the filter holder, I fold mine at the crease, and the water ends up not going into the filter and the ground will flow out of the holder and clog up the drip causing a mess.

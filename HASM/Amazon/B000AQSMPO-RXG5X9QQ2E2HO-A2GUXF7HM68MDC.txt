Title: Great Coffee - any flavor, quick!
Content:
The wife and I enjoy waking up and having a perfect cup of coffee in the morning without the fuss and mess of preparing 10 cups that we won't consume all at once. The Keurig has simplified our mornings by allowing us to brew any flavor we desire, independent of each others likes. If I want coffee, and the misses wants to sink into a cup of tea, it's as easy as placing the right K-Cup into the Keurig.
We also own an art gallery in New Hope PA. When people come in to browse, one of the first things we do upon them entering, is offer them a cup of coffee or tea, especially in the Winter months.
Even they are more amazed at our hospitality and willingness to brew fresh hot beverages for then in a matter of 60 seconds. Make us look like champs! We wouldn't part with our Keurig for anything.

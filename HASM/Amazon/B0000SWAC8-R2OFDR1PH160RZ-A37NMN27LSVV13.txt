Title: Great Machine!
Content:
This vac was recommended by our allergist, but after reading some of the user reviews I was a bit reluctant to buy it.  I have to say that after 3.5 months I am extremely pleased with this unit.  This thing has incredible suction...the first time I used it I think I filled the bag almost halfway and this was less than a week after vacuuming with the old machine.  Also, despite the power, this vacuum is pretty quiet.  I have no complaints at all with the performance, nor have I had any problems with it.  Everything is still good as new.  I love that it's easy to connect/disconnect the parts.  I do have a couple very small gripes.  The first one is that the power head could sound better.  It works great, but the outer shell vibrates and makes it sound cheap.  My other complaint is that the attachments on the handle will not stay attached.  Their location is great, but since they fall off constantly it defeats the whole purpose of having the stored there.  Still, the performance of this vacuum more than makes up for those two gripes and I highly recommend it.  And yes, this vac really filters the air well.  I am using the Clinic bags and I'm not at all afraid to get my face down by the exhaust and breath the air.

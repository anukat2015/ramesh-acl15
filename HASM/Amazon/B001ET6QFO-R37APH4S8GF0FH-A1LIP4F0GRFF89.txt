Title: Good, but not exceptional
Content:
This is a solid camera. The performance and usability are excellent.
The image quality is only so-so. Canon clearly went too far with the resolution on this one. The low-light performance is not significantly better than my 3 year-old Rebel XT (although the resolution is twice as good). I am rather disappointed with an only barely-usable ISO 6400 and lots of noise in the shadow regions. Even shooting in RAW is somewhat disappointing. Further, you really need a very good lens to take advantage of the 15MP. 
So overall it's a nice semi-pro camera, and the screen is wonderful, but it does not live up to expectations.

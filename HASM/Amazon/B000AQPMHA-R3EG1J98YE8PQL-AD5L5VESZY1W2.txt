Title: Cool machine, weak coffee
Content:
The idea and design for this machine are very good.  The ease of use and lack of mess are very good.  The cup of coffee that it brews is not so good.      The vast selection of coffees is enticing but no matter what type I used the  product was 8oz. of brown water.  Granted I like stronger coffee but for some reason this machine seems to make VERY weak coffee.  I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if the unit is defective.........

Title: I just love it!
Content:
I just love this vacuum.  My cleaning woman loves it, too.  At the beginning I thought I made a mistake because it takes some reading to understand how it works.  However, if one takes the time, this machine it's incredible.  the first thing I noticed was the clean odor when vacuuming.  I don't have to put any kind of deodorant or pellets in the bag.  Secondly, as you vacuum longer with it, the amount of soil in the container dimishes and now it takes about an hour of vacuuming before we have to change the water.  We have tested it on rugs, upholstery and windows, and once you get to know how it works, it's really good.  I am very happy with my ROTHO Twin TT and as much as I love my Miele, this one has become the queen, in my house.

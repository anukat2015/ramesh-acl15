Title: Stay Away -- Hardrive problems -- Stay Away
Content:
I have had this product for 2 years. I barely used it the first year b/c I was still using my old Dell (the laptop this Toshiba was supposed to replace), and I had to send the Toshiba to the shop for hardrive repair just before the warranty expired.  After being in the shop of about 2 months, I got it back.  Now it about 6 months later and the warranty has expired and I'm having the same problems.  I've been researching the internet and this seems to be a common problem for these Toshiba's.  I guess I'm back to my old Dell (which is still working).

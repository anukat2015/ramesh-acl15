Title: Early review but so far... this piece is stunning!
Content:
This is my first (D)SLR. And I have to qualify myself as one having NO photographic skills except to point the lens in the right direction ;) Bought Canon SX20 IS as I wanted a simple camera with nice zoom and movie mode but SX20 was a complete disaster. So, decided to upgrade to T1i based on several recommendations. Have been reading and learning about photography and playing with this camera & kit lens for about a week now. So far I have been impressed with the handling of the camera and the image quality. Images in fluorescent light are off, but at least I know that AWB is not easy. The menu sometimes is a bit of a pain - like selecting sepia tone etc - you have to hit so many buttons. 
Video looks good on camera but lots of jerkiness/streaks while playing on PC - due to slightly older (2 years) computer + software. Converting these MOV files to VOB does not show any problem and plays smoothly. I think it is the auto exposure compensation (not flicker noise) that causes some changes in light while panning but I am not sure. Havent worked on it too much. 
I am sure I have only skimmed the surface on what this camera can do but truly this is a great buy.

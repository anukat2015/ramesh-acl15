Title: This is the best vacuum EVER!
Content:
Granted, I suppose I'm a bit of a geek, but I LOVE this vacuum. It's not as loud as some people have said - particularly when I use the "floor" function to clean the carpet around my skittish bird. The canister follows around after you very easily despite the stated weight, and the "15-inch powered nozzle" makes use of every bit of its size - the suction runs clear across the bottom of the nozzle and actually pulls some out-of-reach items towards it. It picks up things that my more dexterous little vacuum couldn't even grab. Finally, the "telescoping extension" feature on the wand is amazing. I hadn't read about it in my research, so it was like an extra little surprise. Oh, and the propulsion when on "carpet" mode is spectacular. It's a solid, responsive, well-designed little buddy.

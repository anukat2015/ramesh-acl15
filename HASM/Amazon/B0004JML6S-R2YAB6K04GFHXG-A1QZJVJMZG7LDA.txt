Title: not a bad value for the money
Content:
I just went to Big Lots and bought the FME4, as advertised for $30.00. Wow, it's been a long time since I had coffee this hot. Had to buy a new pot because my less than a year old Cuisinart was leaking as soon as I filled the reservoir. It never did make coffee this hot! No, it is not the strongest material, but since every pot I buy begins o leak after a year or less, I am tired of paying big bucks. It's working great for me.

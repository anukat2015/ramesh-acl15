Title: LITTLE Machine
Content:
I have had this for over a year and I am not disappointed that I got it.  I have owned uprights since I began purchasing vacuums.  We own lots of pets with long hair and we have carpeted stairs.  I got tired of lugging the upright up and down the stairs and almost falling on several occasions.  When I saw this and ours happened to quit I decided to purchase and I am glad I did.  Besides some of the comments which I agree on their pros and cons, the only con I have is that while it is compact and lightweight the bags are small.  If you have a good number of pets be prepared to change bags frequently.  I don't mind the small bags since the machine is easy to carry around the house to use and up and down stairs.

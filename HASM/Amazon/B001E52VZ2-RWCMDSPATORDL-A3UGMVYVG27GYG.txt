Title: Light and efficient
Content:
This is a great little vaccum. I use on hard wood floor and it has become my back's best friend. The only downfall is the power cord 1) it's too short and 2) you can't retract it. Aside from that, it's exactly what I was looking for, cheap, light and efficient. The suction is amazing!

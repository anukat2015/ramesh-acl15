Title: Makes Great Coffee!
Content:
We've had this coffeepot for 3 years.  The built in grinder - where you grind and perk by pushing one button, is terrific, and of course we can really tell the difference using fresh ground coffee beans. I like using fresh French Roasted beans, and programming it to start just before I awaken. We've never had any problem with it. The charcoal water filters are expensive, and you have to clean out the coffee grinder each time you use it, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

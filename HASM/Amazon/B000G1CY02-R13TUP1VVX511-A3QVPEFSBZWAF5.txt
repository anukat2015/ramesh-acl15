Title: Room Heater rather than People Heater
Content:
I had a quartz radiant heater before I bought  this one and I expected the same results, but this heater gives out most of its heat through the top and therefore heats the room instead of what's in front of it.
It has an option to be wall mounted, which is what I had planned to do, but the back becomes very hot and I wouldn't dare mount it next to a wall.
I have it in my 12x10 computer room and it does a very good job of quickly warming the room since the room is small and I can close the door. When I'm in my open floor plan living room though, I use my quartz heater since it heats only me and doesn't waste energy heating the whole room.

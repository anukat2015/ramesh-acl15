Title: As Powerful As They Come
Content:
I'm simply thrilled by how well the Panasonic MC-CG885 cleans! At 12 Amps, this vacuum cleaner is as powerful as they come! The powerful suction helps in tackling large areas with amazing speed and ease. It works very well on both bare floor and high pile carpets. On carpets, the motorized beater brush provides plenty of torque to quickly loosen any deeply embedded dirt or pet hair. It should take at most a couple of passes to clean an area, even on very dense carpets.
Attachments
-----------
- Cleaning Attachments:
The only fault I can find with it is the lack of an upholstery tool and a floor brush. Besides the main bare floor/carpet attachment, the unit comes with only (1) a small dusting brush and (2) a crevice tool. For the most part though, the lack of a floor brush attachment is not a big deal since bare floor/carpet attachment is really light and maneuverable. Besides, I use my Shark Cordless Hand Vac in conjunction with the Panasonic to tackle the hard-to-reach areas. For upholstery cleaning, I suppose the dusting brush will have to do.
Pluses
------
- Lengthy Power Cord
The length of the retractable power cord is 28 feet, so it provides PLENTY of slack for even the largest rooms. It can be quickly retracted by pressing a button.
- 4 Adjustible Heights
The height of the floor/carpet cleaning attachment can be adjusted for vacuuming bare floor and low pile to high pile carpets. There are 4 height settings: XLO, LO, MED, HI.
- Quick and Easy Assembly/Dissembly
The unit can be quickly assembled for use and quickly dissembled for storage after use.
- Easy-To-Clean Beater Brush
The motorized beater brush, unlike those on some vacuum cleaners, can be easily cleaned -- no more impossibly tangled mass of hair and filth on the brushes.
- HEPA Air Filter
The tiniest amount of dust in the air can trigger my nasal allergies (that's why I use a Honeywell Air Filter). If you're an allergy sufferer like me, you'll appreciate the Hepa filter on this vac, which traps the smallest dust particles to prevent them from being released back into the air.
- Economical Replacement Bags
The replacement bags are easy to replace without causing dirt and dust to spill out and make a mess. A brand new bag may look small, but the slightly elastic material will stretch out as needed to contain the dust and dirt as it fills up. Each bag can actually hold a lot. The vacuum uses the Panasonic AMC-J3EP replacement bags - they come in a 4-pack and are very affordably priced. (Note: this vacuum comes with a vacuum bag included.)
Ergonomics
----------
- The Power Switch/Slider has 3 modes: Off, Floor, Carpet. It is conveniently located on the handle and is designed to be operated with the thumb of the hand holding the handle of the unit. This makes it possible to maneuver the wand while freeing up your other hand to reposition the cannister when needed.
- For those who are right-handed, the handle is free to rotate up to 90 degrees counter-clockwise to help accommodate the natural position of the wrist. Sorry, lefties, this ergonomic feature is designed only for those who are right-handed.
Conclusion
----------
Last but not least, I must mention this thing is a beauty, so it won't be an eyesore when it's not tucked away in a closet. It's well-designed and looks to be very well-constructed - I'm looking forward to using it for many years to come. For me, the only drawback is the limited cleaning attachments. Still, I have rated it 5-stars based on its impressive cleaning ability, ergonomic design, and looks. Yes, the price is steep, but price aside, if you're looking for a powerful vacuum cleaner that's easy to use and maintain, the Panasonic MC-CG885 OptiFlow Vacuum Cleaner is it.

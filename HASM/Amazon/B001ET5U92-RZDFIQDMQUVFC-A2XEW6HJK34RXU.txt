Title: Excellent camera
Content:
This is my first Nikon camera and I have to say I am extremely impressed.  If you're at all familiar with manual settings, you'll find the D90 to be extremely well laid out for making any change required on the fly.  Once you get that down, there are many other layers of settings to tweak as well.  I bought it with the Nikon 16-85mm VR lens.  Picture quality has been outstanding.  Only thing I have to complain about (and maybe it's adjustable in a menu that I haven't discovered yet) is that the file numbers will reset themselves when you format the memory card, thus the potential for duplicate file names when you download the pictures.  But that's a very minor complaint.  VERY highly recommended.

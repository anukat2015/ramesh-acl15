Title: Product As Expected
Content:
My decision to purchase was based upon comments & product reviews indicating the Zojirushi kept the coffee "HOT" longer than any other mostly due to the stainless steel receptacle surrounding the coffee grounds as well as the thermal pot.  After 3-4 hrs. it's pretty much the same as any other except the coffee does not taste "cooked".  It's sleek & doesn't take up as much space as my old "station" system but it's definitely not as conveneint as one.  I think the twist-open top indicator could be improved.   Also like the permanent filter purchased which improves coffee flavor.  Overall I'm not sorry for the purchase but would recomment lower expectations; as unless you drink the coffee within the first hour or so it's pretty much the same temp as any other system.

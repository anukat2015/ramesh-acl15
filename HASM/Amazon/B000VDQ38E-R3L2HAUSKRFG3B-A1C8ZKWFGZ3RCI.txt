Title: At Last-A Great Vacuum!!
Content:
I have two cats, both shed ALOT. Plus they track litter no matter what I do.  I have tried several vacuums before purchasing the one.  I used it over the weekend-it worked great!  When I saw how much hair and debris collected in the cup-I was a little disgusted in the poor performance of my previous vac and the cleanliness of my rugs!  I practically had to scrub the carpet over and over with the old one.  This one was practically self propelled compared to that one.  Vacuuming is no longer a chore!

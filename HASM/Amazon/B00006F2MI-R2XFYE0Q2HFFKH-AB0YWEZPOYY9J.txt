Title: LOVE IT
Content:
I have a Cuisinart grind and brew (with the glass carafe) that I bought and took into work because I purchased a Stainless steal GE coffee maker for home.   To say it was junk is an understatement!  I loved the first one so much I purchased the Cuisinart grind and brew with the chrome carafe for home.   It makes great coffee and keeps it hot for hours.   The only thing that is different is that I have to use a clear measuring cup to put the water in because you can not use the carafe to measure the water...totally worth the trouble.

Title: Terrific Hoover Cannister Vaccuum
Content:
I really like this vaccuum cleaner.  I like the the power (with 3 different power levels), the edger and having the controls on the handle.  I have not had problems with the size of the cannister.  It lasts thru one cleaning and I empty it. I appreciate the reviews written on the Hoover upright.  I was going to buy that until I read the feedback. That saved me a lot of headaches.  The bagless system means never losing suction because of a tear in the bag. Wish I had bought a vaccuum like this years ago. If you want affordable power - this is it.  Love it!

Title: Fun While It Lasted
Content:
This was a powerful little pick up machine for the first month or so. Despite following all the rules about charging and recharging cordless batteries, my purring machine soon migrated to a low growl and then nothing. Unfortunately, I didn't located the warranty and receipt until the day after my warranty expired.  I ordered a new battery from the manufacturer. After a couple of weeks, I received a post card from Euro-Pro saying "Due to the large response, the item you've requested is temporarily out of stock."  Translation... this hand vac isn't very reliable and we can't keep enough replacement battery packs in stock to support it.  After waiting 2 months for this battery pack, I finally called the manufacturer and was told a shipment wasn't expected for another month. They offered to send a remanufactured hand vac instead, so I agreed.  I'll keep you posted if it works any better, but after all the hassle, I still wouldn't recommend anyone else go through this much hassle for a hand vac!  My first post about this product was unexplicably removed, but I hope this one actually gets posted so that customers will be able to make an informed decision before buying this product.

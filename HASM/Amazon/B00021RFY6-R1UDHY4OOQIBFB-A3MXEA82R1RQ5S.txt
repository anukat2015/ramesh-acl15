Title: Kinda Loud
Content:
I like my new machine, but inside parts don't seem to fit in as crisply as I would like in such an expensive coffee maker.  Regardless, aside from the noise - it's much louder than my old coffee maker that also ground coffee beans - it looks nice, makes good coffee, and I hope to enjoy it for years to come.

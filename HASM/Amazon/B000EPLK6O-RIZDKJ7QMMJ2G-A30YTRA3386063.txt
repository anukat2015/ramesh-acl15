Title: Here's the real scoop - at least IMO
Content:
I have only had the Zutto coffee maker for less than a week, but can already say that I like it a great deal. It does not have all the bells and whistles of many other coffee makers, but it does make great coffee into a glass, not un-insulated metal carafe. It does have a water level indicator, unlike the only other (as far as I know) four cup cone-type filter machine. Having the removable water tank is a great feature. Now, let me talk about some of the negatives mentioned in other reviews. Some have said that a gold-tone permanent filter will not fit. I don't know where they got that information; I have one and it fits and works beautifully. As to the coffee not being hot enough - 180 degrees is supposed to be 'optimal' for brewing; I measure 173.8 on a very good digital cooking thermometer right after brewing. I can't believe that 6.2 degrees makes that much difference, and I do not consider this "not hot" as stated in another review. I have no trouble holding the lid in place while pouring. I see no splatter of hot water during brewing. No, you cannot get a cup during brewing, but with a coffee maker this small, the short wait should not hurt. I now use a smaller amount of coffee than I did in either a Black and Decker or a Mr Coffee and get stronger, more flavorful coffee with more aroma than with either of the above. What's not to like? Oh, you have to turn it off manually...Oh well!

Title: Cuisinart Coffee maker
Content:
I have been using this coffee make for about 30 days and am quite satisfied. The Stainless steel pot keeps the coffee hot; how long depends on how much is in it - the more, the longer it stays hot. It looks good and does not take up much room on the counter. I particularly like that it shuts off completely after brewing; no hot plate that keeps clicking on and off.
The only negative feature, but one i'm willing to live with involves having to turn the pot almost upside down to get the last of the coffee out. But it's a minor thing.

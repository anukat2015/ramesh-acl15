Title: Good for desktop replacement
Content:
Pros: you get a powerful laptop for a sweet price, works fine and the new software and options with Windows 7 are fun to use
Cons: the chassis isn't well made nor is the keyboard, it's a good laptop for you to hookup a mouse and keyboard and monitor to and use it at home while being able to take it out occasionally, but a highly mobile person on the move might want to get something more sturdy - the lid on mine is already kinda loose

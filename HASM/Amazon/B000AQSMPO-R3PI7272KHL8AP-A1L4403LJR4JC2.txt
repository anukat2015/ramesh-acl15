Title: Best buy!!
Content:
Just bought the B60 Keurig & I was debating between B30, 40, & 60...and boy am I glad I chose this one!!  First, I loved the price of B30, but the downside is that you would have to refill the water tank each time you want coffee.  The B60 is a little bit more but I love that the B60 has a big water tank and can last me many cups before I need to refill.  Second, I love that I can set a timer on my keurig.  My husband gets up way earlier than I do...and I can set the timer to 6am so by the time he walks down to the kitchen, the keurig is on and waiting for him.  Its awesome.  Lastly, I love that it produces a great cup of coffee.  I ordered a bunch of variety packs so I can figure out which ones are my favorites...but so far, the coffees that I have tried are great.  
I was a little nervous reading a lot of the other reviews of how their broke easily or stopped running...but so far, it works great.  If it continues to work like this (which I hope it does)...there is nothing but love for this little machine.  I love it.  No mess, no clean up....with 3 little boys running around the house, every time I get a cup of coffee...its definitely a treat. This is an AWESOME buy.

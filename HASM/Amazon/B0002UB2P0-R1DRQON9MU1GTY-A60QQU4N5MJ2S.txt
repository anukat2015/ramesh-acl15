Title: Broke as a Joke after 2 months!!!
Content:
I recieved my RIO carbon as a christmas gift. I loved it.. NOTICE I said LOVED!!! It died for no reason. I didn't even have a chance to wear the plastic off the back if it. It was not scratched, dropped, wet or anything... 
I called Rio to see what they could do. I have yet to experience the drama that comes along with the exchange. But I am very let down because I liked it. 
I hated the fact that I could not seem to get things to play in the order in which I wanted them. I have not even gotten a chance to experience listening to a downloaded book on it... 
My advice is Get an IPOD I believe they are more reliable. Then when I asked my friend for his recipt from Radio Shack it was blank... the Ink faded... SO what am I to do now?
Save your $$ the Rio is not ready... It SUCKS!!!

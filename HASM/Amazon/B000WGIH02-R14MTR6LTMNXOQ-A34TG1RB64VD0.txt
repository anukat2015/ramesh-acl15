Title: Samsung does not give information about their products.
Content:
Great product if you do all your research. Samsung did not give any resources on the bluetooth ability of this product(the only thing that seperates it from any other product). Samsung makes Bluetooth stereo headphone called Samsung SBH170 for $69 to $89. You can use two with the YP-P2, but only one will control the player. They should have just improved on the YP-T9B(bluetooth model they never brought to the U.S.)it was a much more sleeker model and more ergonomic(it would fit into your front pocket of your jeans)the P2 is bulky and looks like an old Ipod. The radio does not work with bluetooth(Samsung failed to mention this). On their site they show pretty pictures but no helpful information. They even still show one of their T9 models on explore lineup but when you click on them it takes you to MPfreedom that cuts out the T9. They do not like to update their site as this player the YP-T9B bluetooth is still yet YTB announced release date.

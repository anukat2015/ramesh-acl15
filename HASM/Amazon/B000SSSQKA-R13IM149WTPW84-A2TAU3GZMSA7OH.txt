Title: Dont' buy for carpetted floors
Content:
I am very disappointed in this vacuum's performance on carpet. It just does not do a good job on carpet. It does poorly with animal fur on carpet. The suction is poor even at the maximum level. The canister flips over easily and turns itself off. I regret this purchase of a canister vacuum. It does well on tile but not on carpet. I'm going out and buying an upright vacuum today.

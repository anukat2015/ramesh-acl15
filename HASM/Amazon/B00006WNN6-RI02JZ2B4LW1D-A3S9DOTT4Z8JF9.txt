Title: Perfect for bathroom or under your desk at work
Content:
This basic, no frills heater will do the job if you need a cheap way to heat a *very* small area.
If you're looking for something to heat a larger area (like your bedroom) this is NOT your device, but I use it under my desk at work and it is flawless for that purpose.
It doesn't heat the room- it just keeps me from getting chills, which is exactly what I want at work.  What I like most is that the heat and fan are controlled independently so you can opt to turn the heat off but keep the fan on- so it serves double duty, giving you a small breeze when you're just a little warm.

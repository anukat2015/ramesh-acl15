Title: Great camera
Content:
I need to start off by saying that I am new to Digital SLR cameras and lenses, and am by no means an expert.  I am comparing this camera to the numerous point and shoot digital cameras I've had in the past three years in my search for a "good camera".  The difference in quality between this camera and all of the rest of the cameras I have used is noticeable immediately, both in ease of use, and in end results.  It is a pleasure to work with this camera, the menus are well laid out and everything seems well placed.  It can be a point and shoot replacement (using one of many automatic presets) or you can do some pretty advanced setups (using manual settings).  The images that I am getting out of this camera seem very professional, with very little effort on my part.  And with a quick touch up in Adobe Lightroom, I'm turning out very good quality pictures (in my beginner opinion) with very little work required.  All in all, a great camera for a beginner like myself.  I'd also recommend getting a decent lens (the kit lens is only okay), a lens filter, a tripod, and an image editing program like Adobe Lightroom.

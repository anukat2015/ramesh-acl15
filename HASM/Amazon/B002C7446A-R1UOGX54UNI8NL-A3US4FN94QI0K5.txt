Title: Great computer, great service!! Hallelujah!
Content:
Aaaaaaw man! where do I start
I bought my computer online via Apple directly. It was delivered promptly and well packaged with all the extra bits I ordered. 
The computer was blindingly fast. I chose to run bootcamp with Windows 7. Sweet! High Performance was even faster and life was humming along swimmingly.
Then, some noise and whirring sounds from my laptop around 5 months later. Not cool! I took it in immedeately to the apple store and it was fixed overnight and I'm about to pick it up. FOR FREEEEEE!!!
Hahaha i just feel so happy I chose apple. There couldn't possibly be a better choice or purchase anywhere else. Forget HP! Forget anywhere else, sending computers away for 2 weeks all sorts of nonsense. 
I make my living using this laptop so that woul dhave been unacceptable. one night was bad enough LOL.
So I get the best of both worlds, I can run windows, have the Mac (but I'm not a hipster) and get great reliable service and excellent response times on the hardware.
I couldn't be happier. If you read my other reviews about HP you'll know I'm not gushing for nothing, I've bene through hell with bad PC's and seems the gods have taken pity on me and guided me down the golden path to the land of Apple and Happy People.
Can I get an amen?

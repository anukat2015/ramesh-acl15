Title: can not believe nobody reports any problem yet
Content:
Hi, I can't wait to give myself a holiday gift - GF1 with 20mm f1.7. After using for a week during thanksgiving, I have to return it for a serious issue, but I'm surprised I'm the only one ever reported. the picture taken during sunlight, the picture occasionally totally over-exposed, washed out... I ended up having 2 consecutive pictures with the same ISO, shutter speed and aperture, one is great looking, the other is totally washed out..
This happened about 5 times during the week I owned it, and it scared me that I don't know the picture I'm taking for the "moment" will be right or wrong, this is disturbing.
Fortunately I bought it locally in San Jose Camera, they couldn't figure out and give me a refund, however I really like a exchange but all sold out.. 
Now I don't have the camera for the holiday since it's all sold out and I'll be flying and traveling now; I can only blame Panasonic for this flaw. Hopefully my case is the last one but I'd hope Panasonic is aware of it and fix the root cause..

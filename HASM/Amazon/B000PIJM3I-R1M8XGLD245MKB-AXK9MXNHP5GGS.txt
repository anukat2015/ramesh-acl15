Title: A waste of money
Content:
Think very hard before buying this machine.  We bought it with the hope it might actually cool down a room, or at least keep a room comfortable, but alas nothing of the sort was achieved.  Instead we are left with a frightfully noisy and large thing that fails simply does not work.  
It is besides a very poorly engineered machine, demanding that one spends half an hour at a time just adding or subtracting one of the hoses depending on how hot it is outside.  And then one is left to refit it to the window, which cannot be done without copious amounts of unsightly gaffer tape.  The instruction guide is so idiotically conceived as to explain, with an entire page of the booklet, how to fit batteries into the remote, yet not a word was written on how to connect any of the hoses, nor how to adjust the vent.  
It should be a crime that such a machine be allowed to be sold.  Do yourself a favor and buy something, anything, else.

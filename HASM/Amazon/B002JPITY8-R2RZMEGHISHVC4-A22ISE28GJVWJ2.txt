Title: All it needs is speakers, gps and a phone
Content:
I've owned all the iPhones; heck I'm typing this on my 3Gs. I love the iPhone so I hope you understand how hard this is for me. :-D 
the ZuneHD only needs a gps chip, builtin speakers and phone intergration and i'd leave the iPhone forever. It's that great. 
The User interface is So crisp and clean. The images litteraly pop off the screen. It's very thin light weight and heavy on the design. This is the only item out since the iPhone and itouch that isn't trying to be the iPhone/itouch. The Internet browser is really fast and responsive. But enough of that, you want a good review, you can check out the reviews on engadget or gizmodo. Just know that this is finally a real good competitor to the iTouch.  So if you're tired of iTunes (I hate iTunes) this is the way to go.

Title: A great upgrade from my Rebel XT.
Content:
I am really happy with my purchase.  Better resolution, better image quality, beautiful and bright hi res LCD, live view, HD video, etc.  I was partly attracted to the T1i b/c of it's HD video capability.  I read some negatives regarding it such as poor 1080p video and poor sound quality due to the stock mic.  I did not intend on getting this to replace my camcorder so it has been just fine at 720p for quick clips in between pictures.
At the recommendation of another reviewer, I bought the SanDisk Extreme III SDHC from the start and haven't had any issues.

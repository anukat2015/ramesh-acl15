Title: Never a laptop Guru
Content:
I recieved the Toshiba just as advertised, it is very sturdy, actions are very smooth as laptops go.  I really like the numberpad.  It connected to my system without any problems. So far, I have nothing to report other than a very good product for a fair price.  Actually Battery life is very acurately estimated!  This is a true exception to the rule with laptops I have used in the past.  They will state x number of hours of battery life on a charge and normally last about half of that time.  This Toshiba states 2 hours and twenty five minutes, but it actually lasts that long!!  It has been my experience that others advertise 4 hours and last less than 2.
I see this product rating a 5 after I have had it longer.  So far it has been everything advertised and then some!!

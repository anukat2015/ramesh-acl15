Title: It's just about perfect (for me)
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for about a week and have used it every morning.  It works just fine - quiet, simple, very basic.  I especially appreciate the black fill markings inside where the water goes, this is so helpful to those of us with not-so-great vision.  The only thing that I wish it had is a removeable lid on the carafe.  Washing and drying the carafe would be so much easier if the lid snapped off.  I've tried gently to take it from its hinge but it does not come away and I don't want to force it.  UPDATE - I am now able to remove the lid for ease of washing and rinsing.  I just had to sort of force it off one day and it has gotten easier now to take off and put back on.  If they had said the lid was removeable in the instructions I would have tried sooner.

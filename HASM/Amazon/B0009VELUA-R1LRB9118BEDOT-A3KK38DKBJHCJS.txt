Title: Nice!
Content:
This is a great coffee maker. I like the idea of not having a carafe. I noticed in other reviews there was mention of it being messy. It can be if you're not careful. After brewing is completed a lot of moisture will develop on the underside of the lid. When the lid is opened fully it will drip off the back of the lid and down the back side of the unit onto the counter. I've learned to open the lid to about 45 degrees to let the moisture drip into the maker itself then open it fully to remove the coffee reservoir. I also keep a paper towell underneath the maker just in case.
This is the first coffee maker I have had that uses the "Mr. Coffee" style filters. All my others used the cone type. I don't know if it is the brand of filter I am using or what but they always overflow and spill grounds into the coffee reservoir. It doesn't matter if I make 6 cups or 12 cups. The filters drain very slowly. I usually don't get grounds in my coffee unless the reservoir is close to empty.
Also, if I want to fill a thermos or a tall coffee mug, I have to use a seperate cup since there is not enough room for getting these underneath the coffee spout.
All in all, I am happy with the maker. It makes great tasting coffee amd is easy to use.

Title: Fit for purpose - excellent product
Content:
I purchased this product to heat my 24x24 (7'6" ceiling) garage under my house.  During the coldest periods where I live (Western Connecticut) the garage gets down to the low 40s.
After installing the heater and powering it up, in about 10 minutes the chill is gone from the space.  After about an hour the space is very comfortable (about 62 degrees - an increase of about 15 degrees from when it was turned on).  By the end of the second hour the space warmed to 68 degrees.  The built in thermostat turned down to about 3/4 maximum maintains that temperature.
The unit's internal fan is a little bit noisy, but since the unit is intended for a garage/workshop the fan noise is in my opinion not a big deal.
The unit is very well made and easy to install.  After installing a 220 Volt 20A single circuit receptacle,  I hung the unit in the center of the room from the ceiling about 4 feet from the rear wall of the garage.  The bracket that came with the unit is very sturdy and will accommodate several differnt mounting options.
If you had a bigger space or an uninsulated detached garage, a larger unit with more capacity will be needed (5000 watts or more), however for a single car garage or a well insulated two car garage this unit is an excellent value.

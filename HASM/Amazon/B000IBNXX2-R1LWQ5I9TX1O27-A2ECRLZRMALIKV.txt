Title: Zen A Great Little MP3
Content:
I am not very tech saavy and have never owned an MP3 player. I bought a Zune and then found out that I could not record free Overdrive audio books from the library so I sold it at a  loss. I did further research and found the Zen. It is wonderful! I have five books recorded on it and will take it with me when I go to visit my grandchildren in Texas. I used to have to carry lots of cassettes when I traveled. Since they were borrowed from the library, I was always afraid that I would lose one. This is SO much more convenient. It took me quite a while to figure out how to traverse the software and use the bookmarks, but I am improving. I also bought the adapter so that I would not run out of battery power.
It is a great invention!

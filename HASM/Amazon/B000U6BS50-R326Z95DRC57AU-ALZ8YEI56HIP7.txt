Title: Junk
Content:
Don't waste your money on anything from Dirt Devil, Royal, or Hoover. After less than two years, the rubber gasket that seals the dirt cup with the motor housing has disintegrated; making this unit worthless (no suction).
According to the Dirt Devil company... this part is unavailable at any price; even though this is a current model!!!
Not to mention it did not work all that well even when new.

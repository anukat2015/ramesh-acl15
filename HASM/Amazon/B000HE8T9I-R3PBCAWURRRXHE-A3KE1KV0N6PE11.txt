Title: Engineering Mess
Content:
Right now, you're thinking about this vacuum as a cheeper replacement for a Dyson. You're thinking that you want a bagless, but are balking at the $400+ for a good one, and you hope this machine will do...Don't.No, really, don't do it.If you do, you wil find yourself spending half as much time unclogging as you do vacuuming. You will have a stretched-out piece of wire hanger that you keep next to the vacuum... all because some bonehead engineer decided to make the two tightest bends of hose impossible to separate. You will become expert at guaging the raising whine of a clogging pipe, hoping that you catch in in the first 45 seconds, before the motor overheat trips, and you need to let the machine cool, unplugged, for at least a half hour.When you've run out of wire hangers, you'll find yourself cursing (even if you usually don't), as you cut up pieces of electric fencing, twisting the pieces together with your MacGuyvver-like ingenuity to create your wire hose ram.Or maybe not -- maybe by then you'll have thrown the damn thing out a window, and repeatedly run it over with your mini-van. So don't do it.And if you do, remember that I realy did try to warn you, when the police come to take you mini-van keys.

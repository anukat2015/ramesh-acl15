Title: Should Have Moved to a Digital SLR Earlier
Content:
First SLR owned since my old film Canon TLb about 30 years ago. This camera, together with books by Scott Kelby, Videos [...]. and the Strobist website have reignited my passion for photography.  The best thing about a Digital camera is the instant feedback loop. Now I can experiment with various apertures, shutter speed settings, compositions and flash settings and get back instantaneous feedback.  And you can take as many shots as you want and then just delete then if you don't have any winners. Digital SLRs really speed up the learning process.
The XSi is a great camera, and Canon produces a great variety of lenses.  The only area that I am less than impressed is with off-camera flash where Nikon MAY have a slight edge. If nothing else - it is easier to get info on the net for Nikon flash configurations.
Regardless, I love my XSi, and look forward to many months of learning about light, composition and expression.

Title: Works well if it's charged
Content:
At first I hated this thing because the unit was not clicking into the charger all the way (this I didn't know) and it would run for about 10 seconds and quit.  I had it mounted behind the fridge (don't ask why) and it was a reach, to say the least. So I'm not sure if it was the design of the charger or the awkward location I put it in, causing the charging problem.  Suffice it to say I would have liked an LED indicator light to let me know if it was charging.  Other than that, it works well and I'm happy with it.

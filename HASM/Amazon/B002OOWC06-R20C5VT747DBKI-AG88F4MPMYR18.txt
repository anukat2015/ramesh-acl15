Title: Lovely, but some small issues
Content:
Abolutely lovely laptop. The negative issues which I have noticed:
* quiet speakers -- but apparently this can be changed in settings, saw some reviews somewhere saying how
* bad microphone -- you need to be very close to it for people to hear you. Otherwise it breaks up and just snippets get transmitted. Perhaps this can also be adjusted, but have tried the obvious controls without success. Camera great though -- image over skype very clear and natural.
* keyboard a little annoying -- especially if you're used to the good solid chunky keys of old Dells. The one here bends in if you press hard while typing and has a flimsy feel. Also, I type moderately fast and with the flatness of the keyboard my fingers tend to just glide along the keys -- it keeps missing letters I press. This is the most annoying so far, hope my typing will adjust -- perhaps each key needs to be pressed more vigorously. This might not be a problem for everyone, depends on your typing style.
But great battery life, gorgeous design, sleek, light, beautiful, quiet. Would definitely recommend if the above issues are not too serious for you!

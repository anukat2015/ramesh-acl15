Title: It's Just OK
Content:
First of all, if you do not live in the dry desert, don't bother.  It's not crazy humid here but even with a little humidity this just adds to it.  I always used very cold water and a ton of ice and it was barely "cool air".  I think it would be good in AZ or NV but not worth the money if you live in the northeast like I do.  After the first couple of uses I didnt bother with it any more.  Waste of money for me.

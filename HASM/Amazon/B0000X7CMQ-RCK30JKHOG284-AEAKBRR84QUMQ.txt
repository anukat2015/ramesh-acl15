Title: LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER
Content:
We have owned the Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker
for 6 months and have had no issues with it.  The carafe keeps it hot for hours and the carafe capacity is great.  After reading the issue about the filter size, I bought a 4 cup gold filter and it works fine.  It has a stylish design, though it is a tall machine.  I would buy it again!

Title: Spiffy little laptop
Content:
Before purchasing this laptop I had a customized HP DV4T - 4 gb ram, 320 gb hard drive, 2.53 intel core 2 duo processor and Windows Vista Home Premium.  I was waiting for a smaller laptop with a better processor than the atom and slightly bigger than 10"-11.6" netbooks.  I jumped at this deal when Amazon offered the $75 gift card promotion.
Onto reviewing the actual laptop.  The only problem I had with this laptop is that the cursor would jump around when I was typing.  I'm a graduate student who has to type - a lot.  It's frustrating for the cursor to jump around.  I researched to try and disable the touchpad with no luck.  Finally, my geek husband found the "touchfreeze" app.  I downloaded that and have had no problems since then.
I wasn't sure if I would like the chiclet keyboard, but I do!
The laptop is the perfect size and performance for my needs - word processing, e-mail, light gaming, and surfing the internet.

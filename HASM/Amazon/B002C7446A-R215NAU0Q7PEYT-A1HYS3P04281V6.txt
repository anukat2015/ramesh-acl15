Title: Love it!!!!
Content:
I love this MacBook.  I have a regular laptop  at work and the MacBook at home.  Before the MacBook I had a PC and I am so glad that I switched to Mac.  First of all, the computer is fast.  I love the software that comes included, iTunes, iCal, iMovie, iPhoto, Photo Booth, etc.  I like that comes with a camera and I can chat with my family anytime I want and I don't need to buy an external camera.  Also the internet is so much faster.  When I was using my PC and the laptop, I always thought that my internet was too slow.  I have DSL, but once I started surfing the Web using the MacBook I realized that it wasn't my internet.  It was the PC.  Also, the computer never freezes and I can go from one software to another very fast.  The appearance of the computer is very nice.  It is slim, the backlit keyboard is a nice feature and the resolution of the screen is great.  I love that I can save my photos directly from the SD card.  I haven't installed too many programs in it besides Microsoft Office since so far everything I've needed came included with the computer.  I'm never going to buy another PC or regular laptop.

Title: Capable but Huge
Content:
This 17'' monster is no lightweight. The Dell Insprion E1705 is a big computer but does the job with no problems. I encountered no problems with this product.
Pros:
The keyboard is spacious and does not cause any trouble when it comes to typing. The display on the is great...like having your own portable TV. It comes with a DVI port that allows for easy connectivity to HD tvs (with the use of a DVI to HDMI cable of course). Media Center is useful when using its TV tuner capabilities.  
Cons:
The computer is a bit outdated when it comes to internal hardware. The hard drive is a fraction of the size from what you may see in newer computers. The processor speed is no longer at its prime...lacking speed for multimedia users. Also, this notebook is only capable of holding 2 Gb of Ram. Although it only comes with 1 Gb stock its ability to be upgraded any higher is quite limited.

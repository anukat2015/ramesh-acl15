Title: Should Have Kept The HZ 519 Model
Content:
I was forced to use this current model for my refinished basement after my reliable HZ 519 model finally conked out on me after 6 years of reliabiity.  This current replacement I must say is a huge, huge disappointment for large rooms because it doesn't heat anything of size.  Even with the quick heat setting, unless you are right in front of it, you will find yourself mad.  Even putting it in the kitchen as small as it was didn't generate nearly the heat as the white HZ 519 model did.  That was the only space heater I have ever purchased that would warm my entire basement and I would have to turn off because it made the room too warm for comfort for me and the dogs on the highest settings.  Even before I put a storm door and new steel entry door on the basement entrace, this heater was still able to warm that area despite the extreme draftiness an allowance of unblocked air from my old worn out entry door.  This current model I bought last year as a backup/use for my toddlers room as a table top heater that she couldn't get to still doesn't heat her tiny room as much as it should.  Now that temps have dipped into the 20's, I am really missing my HZ 519 model to the point I am going to order one online from whatever retailer may have one in stock.  Unless you are heating up a small den or even a tiny bathroom without a regular vent for heat to blow into, i just think this model here is a waste of time and money.  Find the white HZ 519 model.  you will never be disappointed with that one and you won't have any need to turn up the thermostat past 75 degrees.

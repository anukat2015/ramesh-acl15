Title: Love it
Content:
I bought mine several months ago. I still like it very much. 
Vista Home is just too slow during start-up and program launch. Wished I spent a little more to get Vista Business so that I can downgrade it to Win XP tablet. It doesn't matter anymore anyways, I switched to Ubuntu 8.10 and have been quite happy with it.
The screen is crisp, but probably not too small for long use.

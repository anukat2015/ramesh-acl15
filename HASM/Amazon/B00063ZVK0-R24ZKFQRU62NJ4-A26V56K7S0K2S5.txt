Title: Great quiet heater - better than the other Vornado model
Content:
I have purchased several of the cheaper model Vornado heaters (AVH2). These heaters always did a great job heating the room, but they made this loud buzzing sound - sort of like an electrical substation. 
I assumed the only difference between this model and the AVH2 was the digital display. But no, this model is MUCH MUCH quieter! The buzzing sound is barely audible. Do yourself a favor - if you do buy a Vornado heater, spend the extra couple of bucks and buy this one. It ended up costing me only $7.00 more than the AVH2, but the difference in the noise level is worth every penny....

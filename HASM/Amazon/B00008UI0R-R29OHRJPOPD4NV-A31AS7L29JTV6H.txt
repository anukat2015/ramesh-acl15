Title: Well worth it
Content:
I've purchased so many vacuums, it's actually quite sad. They lure you in with this gadget and that gadget, uber-ultra-micro-fibers, and some even have a built-in toaster oven. But what happens to these 'superior' vacuums when you have 2 hairy dogs (and a wife that just will not use a broom first)? They bite the dust (haha?).
In the end, the simplest of simple vacuums seem to keep chugging along. This Hoover, I'd say, seems to fit the bill of effective cleaning...simply. Unlike most other vacuums I've actually used, this Hoover can suck the chrome off of your tailpipes! It has all the attachments that I feel are necessary in a vacuum. The telescoping wand, not only makes your eyes go round and say 'cool', but actually is useful! Even though (with dogs) it needs to be emptied rather frequently, it is so easy it is like "...yea, and?"
If you want to be the coolest kid on the block, go buy a Kirby. Sell your first born and you can wear the Super-V sticker on your T-shirts. Mmmmk. ....or....sell your golf clubs and buy a Dyson. Yea. Nice and cool-looking, but I'd prefer to play 9 every now and again.
Instead, choose this Hoover, as it is the most effective for the money.

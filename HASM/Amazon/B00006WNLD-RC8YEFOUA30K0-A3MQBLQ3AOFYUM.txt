Title: keep the box and return label handy
Content:
I think this product works fine as advertised, though nothing taller than a standard 12oz cup will fit.
However, I sent the first one back after only 30 days because it stopped working.  Never turned on again.
Had the second one for about 8 more months.  Now it stopped working.  Won't turn on anymore.  This replacement cost about $8 in shipping so it wasn't FREE.  So after $23 and 9 months, no coffee maker again.
If you want to rent this model for $20+ per year, it's fine.  If you want something you don't have to buy again and again, it's not.

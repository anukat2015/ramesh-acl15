Title: I named it 'Rudy'
Content:
Kudos to Canton Ohio's Hoover Corp. for bringing this gem to the marketplace.  We bought it to clean two carpeted staircases, several carpeted rooms, 2 large ceramic tile floors and the usual baseboard and accessory vacuuming chores in a basement remodel.  The unit fits on the stairs so you can concentrate on cleaning not balancing some wobbly unit to keep it from tumbling down the stairs.  Make sure you get the model that includes the powered small stair/upholstry accessory. Unit rates excellent for stairs.  Carpeted floors:  Unit can suck the color off a bowling ball - so it picked up dirt we didn't know we had!  Very versatle controls and wand adjustments transforms it quickly for hard floors, again, an excellent job.  It has a bagless system that does not create a mess when you pull it out to empty.  Actually viewing the dirt while emptying it seems to encourage more frequent vacuuming along with eliminating the sourcing of expensive vacuum cleaner bags.  Why did I name it 'Rudy'?  It is named after NY Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as it is a small little efficient bull dog of a vacuum cleaner.

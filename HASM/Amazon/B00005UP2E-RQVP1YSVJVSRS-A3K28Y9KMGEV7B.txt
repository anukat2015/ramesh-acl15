Title: Suits our needs and pocketbook perfectly!
Content:
For hard surface floors with pets (dog, cats, bird) & kids this vacuum is perfect. It is light-weight and compact, easy to use, easy to store. Except the carpet attachment (which we rarely use) accessories attach to the handle, convenient for use & storage. My wife likes the machine because it rolls nicely and is light. I prefer toting it across my back (strap included).
Related to other reviewer comments: (1) The new model has only one filter with recommended changing once per year. (2) Suction is very adequate but not what I expected of a 12 amp motor. Perhaps the HEPA filter requires extra horsepower. (3) When the house is really dirty, the cannister is probably best emptied after every room. (4) Less dusty than compressed air, we use a shop vac to clean the cannister and filter. It gets fine dust out of the filter. We feel we have to be careful, however, not to scrape the filter with hard edges of the suction tube. (5) Power cord retraction would be nice, but I am glad not to have the weight and bulk of such a mechanism.
Summary: This machine is efficiently designed, optimized. The addition of anything more would be a detraction. Because it is easy to use, it gets used more often. If you have carpet, spend the big bucks.  If you don't, this machine will do the job nicely. The low price & HEPA filter are nice bonuses.

Title: Heater Keeps Kitties Comfortable
Content:
Love this heater! It delivers heat almost instanteously. It is very light-weight and portable. What is nice is having the option of placing it on the floor, or mounting it on a wall. Eventually I plan to replace my 2 remaining heaters with this model. Oil filled radiators can't come close to what this product delivers.
My cats are also crazy about it. They take turns on who gets the primo spot directly in front of it.

Title: Removes pet hair like nothing else
Content:
This vacuum cleaned the pet hair in our house so easily, both from floors and furniture.  The Pet Turbo Brush is great, worked on a sofa that even a lint roller wasn't keeping clean at all.  The suction is so good that it cleans deep down and it will pick up dirt like no one has ever vacuumed your floors before!  Dirt cup is easy to empty, and my only complaint/suggestion is that on the part where you wind the cord, they could have made that a bit further apart because there's a lot of cord to wind on the two close-together little hooks.

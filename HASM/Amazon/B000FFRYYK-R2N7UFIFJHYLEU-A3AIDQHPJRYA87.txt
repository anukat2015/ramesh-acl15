Title: AWSOME INSTANTLY BREWED COFFEE
Content:
I recently needed a new coffee maker.  Over the past few years i purchased a Mr. Coffee and a Blacj and Decker.  Both worked somewhat well for a short time.  Being that I work in a bar that uses commercial Bunns, I decided to shell out a few extra bucks and give this coffee maker a sho.  It was a little more expensive than my past two but ont too much more.  I nowq feel it was worth it.  The coffee that it makes is along the lines of greasy-spoon diner coffee.  And if you are a coffee drinker you know that nothing in the world competes with that.  It's the most delicious coffee I have ever had outside of a coffee shop.  Thats not even the best part.  The brew time for a full pot of 10 cups is less than 3 minutes.  So by the time I start it and feed the cat it's done.  And the thermol pot keeps it warm for half the day.  There are no clocks on this coffee maker.  no bells or whistles.  Nothing fancy at all.  But it sure is one heck of a great coffee maker.

Title: Best IPOD shuffle yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
Yes that is right, my wife absolutly loves this IPOD.  For the money, you can't go wrong.  It holds alot of songs for such a tiny MP3 player.  For all the people that wrote bad reviews, maybe they should have realized what you were purchasing.  No it does not have a screen, no it does not have a rolling dial like the bigger IPODs.  It does come with its own docking station.  It is perfect for someone that wants a little MP3 player for the gym, etc.

Title: I think it's nice.
Content:
I bought this laptop primarily for school purposes. It's clear, light and portable, and nice for the price amazon is offering.
I read a couple of the previous reviews about problems with the touchpad. When I first got the laptop, yeah it was a bit annoying. But I got use to it the day after. No worries.
Overall a really awesome laptop.

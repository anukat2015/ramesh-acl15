In short, this new apple laptop gives ultimate performace while delivering a model of aesthetic beauty. I am perhaps guilty of drinking the kool-aid, but one drive on this machine will turn most as it has with me.  Those who want the finest operating system, which is very easy to use as it is completely intuitive, can use the snow leopard installed, and those who want to use another product can use either bootcamp to boot natively, or use an emulation program to run windows in another window. Everything on this machine works seamlessly and easily.  Where I once spent hours installing drivers, connecting to routers after being dropped, or trying to share files, this laptop did without requiring any mental anguish on my part.  For that Apple, I salute you.

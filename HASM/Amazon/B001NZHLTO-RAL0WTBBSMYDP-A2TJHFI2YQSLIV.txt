Title: Great vacuum - attachments are OK.
Content:
This is a great vacuum.  I thought long and hard about spending $1,000 on a vacuum.  It was NOT an easy decision.
5 Stars for the vacuum itself but looses a star due to the attachments.
PROS:
 The vacuum itself is great. Powerful suction, low noise (much lower than any other vacuum I've ever heard) which makes it less annoying to vacuum, the auto-power feature works well (remember, it's the amount of air flow that counts, unless your trying to pick up a bowling ball) and it's less strain on the motor, I definitely noticed the REAL HEPA filtering on this vacuum, no smell an no dust blowing around.
CONS:
The ergonomic handle is OK when using the floor attachments but makes dusting shelves and other items difficult when using the attachments. It is also bulking making it difficult to get under and around items. Their solution is to purchase the car cleaning kit or the micro kit at $150 - 175.  For $1,000 it should have the option to remove the ergonomic handle.  This would have been helpful.
Overall I'm happy with the purchase because I have bad dust allergies and no other vacuum has had real HEPA filtering.  I decided my health was worth the expense.

Title: Small unit, big heat
Content:
It gets cold in Los Angeles. Not like New England winter cold, but when the temps dip into the low 40s and your apartment has very drafty windows, you might as well be sleeping outside. I needed a small heating unit which would run on minimum wattage and take the chill out of the bedroom. I was concerned that it wouldn't be enough considering my apartment has tall, cathedral ceilings, but this heater did the trick. I haven't had to use the unit on full blast, but on minimum set to 3-4 (and placed underneath my drafty windows), I can now tolerate being in my bedroom and sleep in comfort.

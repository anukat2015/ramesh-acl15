Title: keeping cool
Content:
i have used a delonghi portable a/c for about 15 years (that's how long it lasted, so a very good investment).  my model had a bucket to fill with water, which i was looking for again as it significantly increases the cooling.  happy to find the pac600t.  the first one i ordered, unfortunately, was damaged/defective: when i added water, it flooded my bedroom floor (amazon was excellent with the return).  undeterred, i ordered another one, no problems, and am now very comfortable in this heat.  it cools beautifully, even without the water.  it's a bit clunky, but wheels around easily.  sort of looks like a blue r2d2.  it is much sturdier (made in italy) than newer models/other brands, which tend to be made in china.  highly recommend.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I have owned both iPod Touches.  Returned the first because it was so buggy I couldn't stand it anymore (thank you Costco for your 90 day return policy!).  
I just bought this iPod Touch 2gen, and was SO disappointed to see that find my accessories for it won't work! WTF?!  I drive 8 hours from NorCal to SoCal about once a month and using my Griffin iTrip was vital for my sanity in that awful drive.  Now I'm stuck with making 50 billion CDs.  I love the new features on the new IPT.  The speaker was a great addition, and the Nikie + iPod is really cool.  I haven't used the Genius feature yet.  A little annoyed that the hard case I had previously owned won't work for this one.  
If you own a Bose sound system and want to buy this iPod Touch DON'T! It's not compatible.  The new Nano isn't compatible either. It's possible I'll be returning this thing today...ugh.  I love Apple's ipods but could they be more douchey?

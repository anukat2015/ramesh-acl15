Title: Very disappointing
Content:
Bought this as a gift, because previous Big Green Machine finally died. We loved that machine so of course thought the new version would be just as good and better since the new one can heat the water...WRONG. Out of the box didn't work. Called Bissell thinking they would have me return it for a new one. Wrong again, "take it to service center to be repaired". Brand new and one day later in repair shop. 3 weeks later pick it up with NEW pump, tried it for 15 minutes and the pump quit pumping again. This time returned to Amazon for refund going to find an OLD Big Green Machine and stay away from new and improved Bissell products as well as their "customer service". Terrible terrible for an item that cost almost $300.00. Shame on Bissell!!!

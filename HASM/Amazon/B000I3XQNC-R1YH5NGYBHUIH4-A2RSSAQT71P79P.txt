Title: I love this camera.
Content:
I love this camera.  It is fun and easy to use.  The photos are great right out of the box and it is pretty fast.  I used to have a Sony Cybershot 7MP point and shoot and was unhappy with the color, image quality, and auto-focus speed.  The moment of opportunity for perfect shot were often lost and the images were not that great.  This camera is fast and produces great quality photos.  Definately worth the money to get away from the constraints of a point and click type camera.

Title: Big Improvement Over D200
Content:
This camera is a big improvement over the D200 which is what I switched from. The picture quality is amazing and you can crop really far into a picture before it becomes pixelated. The only thing I can complain about is that the video isn't too great because you cant focus and shoot video at the same time.

Title: Great camera
Content:
I was missing moments of my children with my regular point and shoot camera  and upgraded to the xti in march.  This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures.  I took a photography class thru adult education and learned about night photography, taking potraits, and getting the instant of a balloon popping.  All of my pictures came out awesome.  I recomend purchasing the Canon digital rebel XTI field guide book.  Many things I learned in class are explained in this user friendly book.  
Overall, a great camera that is fun to use!  Take the time to play with all the settings and features.

Title: Never worked; never replaced
Content:
I purchased one of these. It never lit. I later learned it was subject to a recall. Anyway, customer service was very effecient at providing a return code to return it for replacement. However, there never was any replacement. So my experience was that I spent a significant sum of money for something that never worked and now looks like money just thrown away.
I'd recommend dealing with a local merchant who will take your return AND provide a replacement.

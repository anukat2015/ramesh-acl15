Title: Excellent dSLR that doesn't break the bank!
Content:
I researched and researched before I purchased this camera.  This is my fourth Olympus digital camera (I just keep upgrading), and I am completely in love with my E500.  It's everything I wanted and more.  The camera feels nice in my hands-- substantial, but not heavy.  The lenses take crisp, clear photos, and the viewfinder, though a tad on the small size, is pretty true to what I capture.  I'm still getting used to all of the options-- there are a ton-- and I sometimes have to remind myself to revert back to some options after I've been playing around with it.  It does take a little more time to be ready to use when you're used to a point-and-shoot.  :)  I also bought the macro lens and a remote control... both have been very useful.  I love the wide angle of the 14-45mm and the telephoto on the 40-150mm is fantastic!  I'm just amazed at the versatility that these lenses offer.  I would recommend this to anyone.  :)

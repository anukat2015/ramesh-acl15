Title: Haier ESA3105 10,000-BTU Energy-Star Window Air Conditioner
Content:
Item arrived quickly, however, the front casing was cracked - probably from shipping. The metal  bracket holding the front grille on was bent causing the plastic on the front grille to be broken. Once installed the a/c is quick to cool and since it is installed in a back room is reasonably quiet.

Title: First digital SLR
Content:
This camera is amazing! If you know how to use a 35mm SLR, then this camera should be a doozie to use. The only set back is that the slowest speed you can use is 200 ISO (which produces light noise); however, this is only minor to the many options that this camera has. If you are thinking about buying a digital SLR, think no more!

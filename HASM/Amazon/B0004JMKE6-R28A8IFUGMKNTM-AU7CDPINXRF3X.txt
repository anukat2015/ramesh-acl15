Title: I Am Happy
Content:
I have purchased Krups coffeemakers for years because I have always found them to be reliable and durable.  This latest model looks like a winner.  The glass carafe is made of thinner, more elegant glass than my previous model - hope it holds up as well.  A couple of little things disturb me.  One is that the lid attaches to the carafe by two small rubbery/plastic projections that fit into small holes in the handle of the carafe.  If one of these projections breaks off, I don't think the lid will stay on right.  The second thing is that the carafe is now shaped so that it is smaller at the top than at the bottom.  When you go to pour out the last of the coffee, the steam escapes onto your hand - ouch!  My old carafe was straight-sided and poured out all the coffee without burning your hand.  The shape of the new carafe is more pleasing to look at, but it does have this downside.  All in all, I am very pleased with the unit and it makes a handsome addition to my kitchen.  The price at Amazon cannot be beat, especially with free shipping!

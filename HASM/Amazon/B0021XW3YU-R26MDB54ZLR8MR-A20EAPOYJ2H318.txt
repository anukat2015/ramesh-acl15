Title: Clear, detailed pictures
Content:
I bought the camera for the 10X optical zoom, because I'd like to get closer up pictures at concerts and I'm looking forward to taking pictures in the mountains this year with it. I already had a good Kodak camera, but with less zoom and less megapixels. So far, I haven't gotten to check out the zoom for things like that, but I've taken some close up pictures of a butterfly and gotten clear, detailed pictures. You can even see the barbs on its legs. It's easy to use, I like being able to crop my pictures on the camera, you can even add a sound tag onto your picture. I like that you can put it on smart capture and the camera does the work for you. Its a good, sturdy camera and even though I had read reviews that it was a little bulky, it is smaller than my last digital camera and doesn't feel bulky to me at all. So far, loving this camera!

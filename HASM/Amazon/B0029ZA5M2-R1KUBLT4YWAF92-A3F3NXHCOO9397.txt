Title: Great Basic Laptop
Content:
I found this laptop on sale at Office Depot on 15 August 2009 with a base price of $[...] minus $[...] instant rebate minus $[...] by mail. Final price of $[...] is a pretty good deal for this machine.  This is my first Compaq/HP laptop, so I can't speak to longevity but after a week so far, so good.  A couple of observations:
* Like most laptops (at least on the budget end) there is a fair amount of bloatware that should be removed for best performance and to free disk space.
* This is my first laptop that features a numeric keypad, very convenient!
* I haven't used the LiteScribe drive, but was surprised to find it on this value priced machine.
Performance is as expected with 2gb of RAM and a 2.2 ghz processor. Very adequate for web, MS Office and typical functions. Runs EVE Online satisfactorily.

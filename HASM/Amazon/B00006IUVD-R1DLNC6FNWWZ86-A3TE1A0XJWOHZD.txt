Title: Great  machine!
Content:
I've had three of these little brewers. Wore the first one out after about 5 years -- prematurely I suppose, but for 18 bucks what can you expect -- and then bought two more about 4 years ago. All have worked well, brew a great cup of coffee and are simple as all get out to use: coffee in, water in, poke the button, out comes as good a coffee as the ingredients you put in. Even my 85-year-old mother has one -- a fourth one -- and runs it without much problem -- though she does have a tendency to scatter the grounds into the water container if the filter is in the brewer. So takes it out to put the coffee in. Simple. And good coffee.

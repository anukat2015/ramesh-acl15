Title: Apple iPod Shuffle
Content:
I own 2 of these, and I just bought 2 more for family members.  This is a great little unit, and perfect for the gym, or going away on vacation.  I wanted something that didn't take up any space or get in my way during exercise and this fits the bill. Holds a decent amount of music and the battery life is better than I thought.

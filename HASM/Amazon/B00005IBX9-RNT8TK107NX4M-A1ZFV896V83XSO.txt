Title: Great coffee but watch out for under-counter lights
Content:
I had used the Bodum French press for years with very mixed results and the DCC-1200 is a giant step up. It looks terrific and quickly makes a large amount of exceptionally delicious coffee. The only drawback is that it is quite a tall unit and lights installed under our top cabinets really heat up its plastic top.

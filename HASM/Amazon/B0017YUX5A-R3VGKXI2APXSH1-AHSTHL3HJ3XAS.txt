Title: Great vacuum
Content:
One of the reasons I chose this vacumm was the three year warranty. I've always bought Kenmore canister vacuums, and had great luck with them, until recently. We bought a new one in 2006, a $400 model, and it only lasted 14 months. I figured it was just a fluke, so we got another one, that one wasn't much better, lasted 16 months. So the three year warranty on the Hoover was very appealing.
So far I really like the Hoover, suction is fantastic, much better than the previous vacuums we have had, and the power head really brings up the nap of the carpet. Very easy to maneuver, and my wife really likes the adjustability of the wand. There is only one feature the Kenmore's had that I miss. With the Hoover you can turn the power head on and off from the handle, but you have to turn the vacuum itself off from the canister. The Kenmore's had a three position switch, witch allowed you to turn the vacuum itself on and off from the handle. I suppose I will get used to that, but I keep expecting the vacuum to turn off when I push the switch.
My only real complaint is that the hose is very stiff, and tends to tangle on itself. If you are not paying attention, it will actually fold over on itself and pinch the hose closed. The hose seems cheaply made compared to the rest of the vacuum. Otherwise I would have given it a solid 5 stars.

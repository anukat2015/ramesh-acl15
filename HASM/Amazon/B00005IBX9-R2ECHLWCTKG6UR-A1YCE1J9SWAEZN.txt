Title: Great cup of coffee
Content:
Because of the design this coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee as compared to some others.  It even made Folgers and Maxwell House taste better.  It's hot when you pour it which is a plus.  With some others I had to put it in the microwave right after pouring it into the cup.  If you want a good cup of coffee at a respectable price I would recommend this one.

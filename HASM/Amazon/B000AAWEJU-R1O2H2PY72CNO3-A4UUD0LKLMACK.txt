Title: would buy again
Content:
bought this vacuum to replace my eureka mighty mite HEPA canister vacuum which finally died after 8 years of service.  
the only drawback is the slightly shorter cord, which is still acceptable and has the big benefit of automatic rewind (something I really wanted in the new vac).  it's also somewhat heavier than the mighty mite, but does a better job and looks to be built to last forever.  
we are using it on wood floors and short pile carpet and it's more than accurate without the power head.  
attachments are a little cheap, already broke the duster, but i would buy it again.  we've had it about a year now so plenty of time to test it and find flaws.

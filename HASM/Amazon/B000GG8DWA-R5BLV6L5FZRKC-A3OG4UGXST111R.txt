Title: A nice little heater.
Content:
I like this little heater.  It is just right for when one wants a little extra heat on his/her feet or just to warm one's hands.  I use it on my screened porch when the weather is too chilly to sit there.  I turn it on and place it in front of me. It warms the area enough to enjoy sitting on the porch and watching the birds in the backyard.

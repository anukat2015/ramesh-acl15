Title: Surprisingly good
Content:
We live in the Northeast. The treadmill we use for exercise is located in a 10x10 corner of our unheated basement. We needed to add heat in some way to make that area more comfortable during the winter months. This Holmes space heater has worked surprisingly well in accomplishing that. The built in thermostat is a nice feature, and it's not unusual for the it to shut itself down before a workout is completed. We'll likely buy another one as we get rid of more of our junk and open up other spaces down there.

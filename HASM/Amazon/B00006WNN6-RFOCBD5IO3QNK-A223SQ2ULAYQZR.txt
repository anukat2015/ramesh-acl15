Title: What a great buy..
Content:
I hesitated before buying this product because it doesn't look so aesthetically pleasing but that can be overlooked! 
Pros: heats.... INSTANTLY! No waiting if your freezing in winter. Small, portable, able to use as a fan for summer or as a heater for winter. GREAT price. It actually doesn't look that bad in person. Fan is pretty quiet.
Cons: I don't understand why there are 6 levels on the knob for Fan. It seems to only have one speed and turns on and off around 3. The fan is not very powerful but I used it today on a very hot and humid day and it was sufficient. The red light on top doesn't ever turn off when it's plugged in.
Conclusion? Can't get a better deal for the price.... overall, very happy with my purchase!

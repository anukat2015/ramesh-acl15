Title: CERAMIC HEATER
Content:
This is exactly what I was looking for. It arrived looking a bit used. It seems that it does uses alot of power and I found the elctrical wires to the wall socket does get very heated. So I suggest supervision when in use, also do not leave it plugged in. It does heat a small room quickly.

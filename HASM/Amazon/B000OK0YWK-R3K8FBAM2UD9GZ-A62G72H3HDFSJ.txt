Title: Zune tastic
Content:
I love my Zune. I bought another for my son. Great screen. Easy to use, holds plenty - I dont need to carry around more than 7500 songs. The Zune Marketplace works great and they have a lot of off-beat (no pun intended) titles. 
I'd like to see movies become available but that's not a big issue for me. Just a nice thing to have. 
The unit is durable and doesnt scratch. The premium ear buds are really great. I bought the accessory kit that includes them, along with the Altec-Lansing speaker system so I can listen without earphones. That also is a very good quality piece of equipment.

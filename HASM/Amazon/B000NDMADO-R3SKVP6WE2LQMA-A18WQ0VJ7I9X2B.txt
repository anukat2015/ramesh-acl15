Title: Could not believe how heavy the wand is and how awkward to use.
Content:
I am handicaped and ordered this machine for me to use. We already own the animal one and love it but I can not use it with my breathing. I thought this canister one I could pull around and would not be that hard to use. It is heavier to try to use than the animal and the wand is so awkward to try to dust with and also extremely heavy. It cleaned beautifully but could not use it myself. I returned this one and bought the new slim 18 model and I can at least use it. Dyson need to redesign this one so it would not be so heavy in the wand and the floor attachment.

Title: Yuck!
Content:
I will never get another bagless vacuum. I have to vacuum daily because of a dog that sheds 24/7. This was not a good vacuum for such a thing. It has good power & is easy to use, but to have to empty the very small dust bin, and clean the filter was a nasty job. Dog hair got all wrapped around the filter, and dust and dirt got trapped inside it. I had to bring it outdoors to bang it off, yuck. I do not reccomend this vacuum to anyone who has to vac more than once a week.

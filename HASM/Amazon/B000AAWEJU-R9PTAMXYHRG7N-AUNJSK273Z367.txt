Title: Designed to be a vacuum you don't have to fight with
Content:
The light weight, compact design makes the Miele vacuum cleaner highly maneuverable. It can be easily picked up and moved up and down stairs. When you move about the room, you don't have to drag it around like a dead weight, a gentle tug and the main motor unit follows along effortlessly. 
It doesn't have a motor-driven carpet brush. At first, I thought it would be a disadvantage, after all, that's a standard feature on most of the American vacuum cleaners. But now I see the logic behind it. The standard floor tool is lighter and easier to move around. Its joint swivels in two directions making it easier to get into corners and under furnitures. The hose also doesn't have embedded electrical cable making it more flexible. For our carpet, the standard floor tool works well enough. The manual does recommend getting the battery powered electro-brush if really deep pile carpet or rug neccesitates it.
The motor is powerful yet very quiet.
Overall, this is a excellent cleaning tool that makes vacuuming less of a chore.

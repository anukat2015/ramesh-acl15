Title: Ok job
Content:
It does an ok job - i have a small office space and wanted something to keep it warm in the winter months.  I am not certain that the thermostat really works as it seems to kick on for a few minutes but shuts off after only a few minutes of on ... certainly not even close to getting the room to the desired temperature.

Title: Ipod Nano
Content:
I love my Ipod Nano. I loaded all of our music CD's into it and I bought a FM charger transmitter to connect to my car radio and my home stereo system. I bought some music on the web and I am going to check out the library for more music to load into it. It holds 2000 songs. It is amazing that this tiny device holds so much music (and movies/videos too). I sit around Borders and listen to music, drink coffee and read magazines.

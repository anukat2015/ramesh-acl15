Title: D50 Camera Shield - Awesome
Content:
I purchased this for our recent vacation. So I would not be worried about carrying my new camera around exposed. When It arrived - just looking at it I was not too impressed. But once got it on the camera, all I can say is WOW! The fit was amazing, attention to detail was fantastic. There was a little piece (left over from the molding process) that covered a very small part of one of the openings. A quick trim, perfect! The feel was amazing, it actually enhanced the awesome Canon ergonomics. It felt so good that I ended up taking 1500 shots over the 5 day vacation. I usually can find some things that could of been improved, but not here. The only thing, and I don't know how, but the lens shield came off fairly easily (surprisingly, not a deal stopper). But when I needed it, it was there. Fantastic product! When on vacation there were photographers around taking pictures, I handed them my camera to take a picture of our family. Every one of them commented on the feel of the shield. One said, "I don't want to give this one back!" 
The way I looked at purchasing it, was a cheap layer of insurance. But, actually improving the feel and usefulness of the camera - totally unexpected! You will not be disappointed!

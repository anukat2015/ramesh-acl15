Title: Keurig Problem Solved
Content:
My aunt has a Keurig and I just bought one for my mother and one for me because we like the coffee and the coffeemaker so much! Her coffeemaker was giving her trouble - not pumping water through. She tried every cleaning method recommended by Keurig, then she took a can of compressed air. like the kind you use to clean out computers. She put it over the opening as tight as she could as she did not have the "straw" on her can. The "clog" in the water tube dislodged and water sprayed out. (Do this when the machine is cool as hot water can burn!) Her Keurig is now working great! She says clean it regularly as instructed and use the can of compressed air if the tube stops up!

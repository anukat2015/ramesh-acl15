Title: Excellent functionality and value after a little repair
Content:
This is a nice little cooler but I did have to do a couple of minor 'adjustments' to get it work trouble free. I had to adjust the water membrane because the water pump was causing some leakage out the back of the unit. I also had to "adjust" the screen behind the front louvers as the louvers were snagging on the screen when set to the 'swing mode'. BTW, the swing mode is a very nice feature. 
Overall, the unit does what you would expect. There is about a 2-3 degree delta T from inlet to outlet when the indoor humidity is around 30%. I did find that on one semi-humid day the indoor humidity rose to nearly 40% (with an indoor temp ~ 79) and air felt a lot less comfy. I think 40% indoor humidity is about the limit this unit can be operated at efficiently. 
Anyway, we use this little cooler in conjunction with a couple of standard central air conditioning units. I've found that I can cut back the AC usage by nearly 10 KWH per day when using this evaporative cooler. i.e. on 95 degree days the power usage went from nearly 50 KWH/day down to under 40 KWH for a 3000 sq-ft house. We liked this unit so much that we ordered a second one. 
In conclusion: If you live in a dry climate (less than 30% humidity) then this type of cooler can certainly be a nice adjunct to regular air conditioning.

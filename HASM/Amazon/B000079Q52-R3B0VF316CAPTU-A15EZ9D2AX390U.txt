Title: Nice product, BAD (nonexisting) service /comapny
Content:
I like this heater for its features: good heat for low energy use, remote, safety features. Worked well for two years and allows me to keep temperature lower around the house (that has no zoned-heat) while I work in my home-office. HOWEVER, when it stopped working all of the sudden after about 27 months, I could not get any response from the manufacturer. The heater stopped working without visible cause. It still had the feedback sound and indicator lights responding as normal but both the lamp AND the swing functions do not work - which seems to suggest that the problem was not the lamp. While the product is relatively inexpensive and you may consider it to be a reasonable price for a product that lasts only two years, my sensibilities as a consumer and environmentalist are offended by the fact that there was no way to get ANY response from tech support. Tried, the phone number (not even taking messages), web support form (error messages), and email - to no avail! It was a major shame to finally dispose of the whole thing. I have to admit that I ended up buying an identical replacement, but I have no guarantee that it will not stop working earlier than two years, even during the warranty period. And the inability to even consider repair versus replacement is in my opinion a sign of a company that is not environmentally responsible.

Title: I love this canister vac!
Content:
I searched for a while for the perfect canister vacuum and I found it! I had always owned uprights, and with three children, and lots of stairs in my house, I figured a canister vac would be the solution. I always lost suction in my other vacuums, but not with this one! It has power suction control, so if you want full power, just press it 3 times, magic! It is easy to maintain and clean, and the attachments are perfect! It handles well, and it is easy to use and change around. I love the extension wand, it makes hard to reach areas much easier to get to. The suction control is also good for when you want to vacuum those valances, but you don't want to suck them into the vacuum!!!!
I know I own the best canister vac in this price range, and if you read reviews like I did, this should help you decide!

Title: Seems great to me
Content:
I just got this vacuum - it's light, easy to move around, and really works. I had an older upright hoover dimension that was ready to die. This EL6988D works so much better, quieter, lighter and easier to move around my home. Seems like a winner, and fit and finish seem good to me. Will report back if issues arise. Pros: Long retractable cord, great carpet cleaning performance, extension telescope handle, quiet. Cons: Tipped over on it's back a couple of times when resting upright and vacuuming.

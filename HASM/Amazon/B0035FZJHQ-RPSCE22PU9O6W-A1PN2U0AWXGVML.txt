Title: amazing little camera
Content:
I picked this up at Best Buy for the retail price of $899. There are a lot of companies on Amazon who are trying to sell it much higher as you can see. I originally purchased it on Amazon but it was out of stock so I waited and waited and waited. They still don't have them. So I decided to get one at Best Buy. The camera is excellent. It's much smaller than my Canon 40D, which is nice for carry on bags for planes when traveling with one good lens.
Image quality is exellent and so is video. The owners manual says to use a class 6 or higher SD card so I went to Fry's Electonic in Palo Alto and bought one (16 gig, Centon brand- aviod that brand), but lo and behold it cannot handle the video! My transcend 8 gig class 6 CAN handle the 1080p video so try to avoid OFF Brands. Stick with Sandisk, Kingston, etc. HD video uses extreme amounts of memory so get at least an 8 gig minimum. The most possible is 32 gig right now.
Anyways, the camera has a beautiful display, fairly fast for its class (3.7 FPS), a decent image stablizing lens and good software for working with RAW files (which are excellent but very large files).

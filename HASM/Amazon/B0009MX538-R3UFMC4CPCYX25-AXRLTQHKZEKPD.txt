Title: Unit froze constantly and died
Content:
I really loved this player-when it worked right, that is. Or should I say was. The player froze all the time, usually atleast once a day. I didn't really mind, many of the micro drive players tend to do this seeing as they have mini harddrives in there. All I would do is pop off the back cover slide the battery out just enough for the pins to release off of the battery contacts and restart the player. I got so good at doing this I could do it while running haha. One day while leaving to jog I turn the player on and it freezes. No biggie I figure. Go through the normal routine with the battery etc etc. I go to turn the unit back on and DEAD. This is where I stand with it now. I lost my receipt so I cant return it to Creative for service. I really loved this player. The only problem I had was the freezing. The thing I liked the most about it is that it was LOUD. If you like music loud this is the player.
PROS:
Media explorer interface was good. Loading songs onto player was easy.
Sound and volume good even with supplied earbuds.
CONS:
Unit contantly froze and eventually died.

Title: A great coffee, espresso maker!
Content:
Since buying this item about 3 months ago it has worked wonderfully.
Some other buyers have complained how the coffee caraffe splashes and is difficult to pour - I agree; it just takes a little different technique to pour smoothly.  Once you master that it's just fine.  I like the removable water reservoir.  Also some customers complained about the expresso part not heating the coffee hot enough - I haven't had this problem.  So far, no problems.  If Mr coffee would fix the pour spout I would give this 5 stars.  However I am very satisfied with my purchase!

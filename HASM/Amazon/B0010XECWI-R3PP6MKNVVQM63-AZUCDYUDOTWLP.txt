Title: Makes a mess
Content:
This machine makes a mess when brewing!  I use a Bunn My Cafe at home and love it.  I was looking for a smaller machine to use at work.  The size is perfect but beware of coffee spilling out of the pod tray while brewing.  It is hot and makes a mess.  I am returning mine and looking for another brand.

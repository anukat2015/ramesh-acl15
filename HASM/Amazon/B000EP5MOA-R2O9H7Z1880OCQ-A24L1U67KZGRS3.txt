Title: iPod lives up to my expectations
Content:
If you like to listen to music, and love, as I have come to love, the convenience of podcast subscriptions, iPod is a great product. I use mine all the time at home and while travelling. It makes bringing my digital music files simple to carry along, and the iPod nano is a well designed product. I will buy another one in future that has more memory, but my 2GB nano has plenty for what I need it for at the moment. I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an MP3 player!

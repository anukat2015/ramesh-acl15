Title: Extraordinary SLR Camera at Great Price!
Content:
One of the finest Digital SLR Cameras you can buy. The camera strikes a nice balance between features and usability that both the amateur and professional photographer can appreciate.
The big difference between this camera (K110D) and the K100D is that his camera doesn't have shake-reduction.
The lens kit is very nice. Also, Pentax made this camera backward-compatible with it's old lenses, so you can take advantage of many of the high-quality lenses available on eBay at a fraction of the cost. This camera is especially good for the beginning/amateur photographer, and Pentax quality at this price is well worth it. In fact, this is the lowest-price digital SLR out there.
Note: One thing you might want to know is that with virtually every digital SLR camera, you cannot use the LCD screen as a viewfinder like you can with the point-and-shoot cameras. Many people spend weeks trying to figure-out how to use their LCD screen as a viewfinder and its simply not done on SLR cameras because the internal mirror (that makes it a single lens reflex camera) is covering the image sensor (CCD chip) so the LCD can only show the picture once it has been taken. Also, because of this, you cannot shoot movies/mpegs like you can on point-and-shoot. The real advantages of a digital SLR is both the ability to see through the actual lens and the ability to change lenses (neither of which you can do on a point-and-shoot). There are other advantages too (like shooting while zooming to create motion effects, etc.).

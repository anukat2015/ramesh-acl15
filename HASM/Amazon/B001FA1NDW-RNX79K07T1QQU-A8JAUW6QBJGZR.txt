Title: nano 8 GB
Content:
I bought this iPod nano (4th generation) to replace or upgrade my iPod mini, so for me this is a huge step in technology and memory and so far I have really enjoyed it. I have had no problems like other people have said and you can disable the shake to shuffle so that is not an issue. Overall I'm happy that I decided to get the upgrade and I recommend anyone else that has a much older style upgrade as well.

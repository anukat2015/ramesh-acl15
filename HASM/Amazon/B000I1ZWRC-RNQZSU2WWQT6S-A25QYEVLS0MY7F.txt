Content:
I have used this camera both during Christmas holiday family gatherings, as well as in the pursuit of outdoor scenery. It is a WONDERFUL camera. Whether shooting in full sunlight at ASA 100, or tripod astrophotography at ASA 1600, the camera truly shines. 
As an astrophotographer, the only issue I find with it is that exposure time is limited to 30 seconds. Other than that, I think anyone purchasing this camera would agree it is a good value.

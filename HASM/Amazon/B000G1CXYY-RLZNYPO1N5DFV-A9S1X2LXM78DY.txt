Title: Nice little office heater
Content:
My cubicle is ridiculously cold, and I got tired of not being able to feel my toes, so I did some research and settled on this heater. (Kudos to Amazon for shipping it in one day, by the way!) I had it set on medium heat and it kept me nice and toasty all day. It's a bit loud, but not unduly so, given that it's a fan. I asked my neighbor (who sits 4 feet away) if it was too loud, and she said, "Is what too loud?" I haven't tried the thermostat, though, since I'm not trying to heat a room, only my feet!

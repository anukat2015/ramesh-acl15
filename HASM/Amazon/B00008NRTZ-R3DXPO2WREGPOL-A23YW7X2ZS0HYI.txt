Title: Poor Design
Content:
Used this vacuum once a week for three months and accumulation of debris was gathering in belt area of powerbrush. We didn't notice the problem until the vacuum produced a burning smell. Bissel tells me that this isn't covered under warranty if debris is caught in the belt area. They also recommend cleaning this area regularly which is only accessable with removing 6 screws and taking the powerbrush apart! 
I believe this is a poor design, the belt is place about an inch away from the outside edge of the roller. I had a Dirt Devil for 10 years and never had a problem. 
Bag sensor doesn't work. 
This will be the first & last Bissel I will ever own.

Title: Unreliable
Content:
I thought this product had a great price and excellent features, and when it worked it was actually pretty excellent.
My complaint though, was that it crashed very frequently. With each firmware upgrade things sometimes got better and sometimes got worse. I had to carry a paper clip with it so that I could reset it when this happened (which happened every day). The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.
Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing. It's dead.
I was very sad to see it die, because I hoped they might eventually fix the crashing problem with firmware upgrades, and despite the crashing everything else was very good (good sound, pleasant interface, even had a line-in recording and built in microphone).

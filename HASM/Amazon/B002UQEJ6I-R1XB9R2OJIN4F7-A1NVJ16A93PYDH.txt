Title: Balance of speed and battery life.
Content:
I typically use the computer for listening to music, hooking the hdmi to my tv to watch 720p movies, building web sites with Microsoft expression, downloading a lot of content from the internet, use video conferencing, and use remote desktop to connect to and fix other computers.
Pros
- dual core does an excellent job of multitasking for a 1.3Ghz low voltage
- chicklet keyboard is a pleasure to type on, just the right feedback
- never gets warm or loud under any condition
- actually will last up to 8 hours
- very solid build quality
- includes multi touch track pad
- very thin and light
- very fast wifi with draft N technology
- bright screen
- very stable with Windows 7
Cons
- cpu can easily hit %100 usage if playing videos (1080p files skip)or heavy multitasking
- GMA 4500 video provides only basic capability and kills your windows index score
- screen quality has limited viewing angles and is some what washed out (it is average compared to other notebook screens, however not a deal breaker)
- difficult to see keyboard in low light (needs back lighting)
- lacks bluetooth and esata ports
- multi touch trackpad gestures do not work as well as they should
- trackpad button is very stiff and can wear down your thumb or fingers
- speakers are very soft
Overall if I had to make the purchase again, I definitely would. Why? For such a low price it does an excellent job of combing good performance with amazing battery life. This is my first Acer and I am very happy so far. However, I still need a powerful desktop though for heavy duty work and bluray ripping.

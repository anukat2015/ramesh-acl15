Title: excellent machine!
Content:
having used the 20D for about 3 years now, the 50D is quite an improved extension of this franchise. Canon's excellent metering and control are quite evident. The new mode choices, the preview back, and particularly HOW Quiet it shoots is quite rewarding. You'll definitely enjoy not only its ease of use but how precise you can manually set your exposures.

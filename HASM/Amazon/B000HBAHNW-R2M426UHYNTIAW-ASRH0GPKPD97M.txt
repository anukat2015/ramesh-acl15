Title: Very Good But Expensive
Content:
There are already quite detailed reviews, so I will simply add my pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Excellent build quality. The quality of material and workmanship is high and exceeds that of most other vaccums. Presumably, this will mean durability. Supposedly it will last 10-25 years. That remains to be seen.
2. Good (and adjustable) suction power. Seems to work well with carpets and hard floor.
3. Hygenic sealed design, filtration (HEPA) and bag system.
4. Ingenius, "crush-proof" powered hose system that allows the use of powered brush attachments.
5. Simple yet excellent wheel design that allows smooth movement of the canister itself.
Cons:
1. High price: $850, that is enforced by an exclusive distribution system with dealers. Enough said.
2. Confusing, minimalist manual that does not explain much of anything regarding the machine. The user has to discover some of the functions by trial and error.
3. "Ergonomic" handle, which turns out to be more straining than a conventional straight handle/tube system.
4. Weight. Unlike many other canisters, the overall weight is high. Because the powered tube and brush heads are also on the heavy side, handling suffers.
5. Inconvenient brush head change system. The powered brush head used for carpets and the "parquet floor" brush have to be removed and switched manually. Since there is no onboard compartment for the parquet floor brush, this means dragging along another accessory while vacuuming, then having to bend down and up every time the user changes cleaning surfaces.
Overall, it is a well designed, if expensive, vacuum that functions well and should prove to be very durable. A few ergonomic oddities and a useless manual prevent it from becoming perfect.

Title: Best heater around
Content:
I tried many heaters, like ceramic with fan, ceramic without fan and this one turned out to be the best. The heaters with fan make lots of noise and its difficult to sleep.
Also the ceramic heaters tend to burn oxygen in air because of very hot coil making you feel sick. On top of it, small ceramic heaters cause uneven heating making you feel even more sick. 
        DeLonghi EW7707CM heater has none of these problems. Because of its large size it can evenly heat the room. Its fins are not very hot so do not burn the air. We received it in 2 days. After using it in our 10x10 bedroom, we feel very cozy and we can sleep very well. Also this is very good looking heater.  You can spend more money one time but you wont regret it.

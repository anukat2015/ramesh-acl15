Title: Nice Coffemaker
Content:
After much research, I chose the Zojirushi EC-BD15 coffeemaker. It seemed to have the highest average positive reviews of the thermal makers I looked at. Actually, reading the reviews before buying increased my satisfaction level. For instance, knowing that the filters must be folded along bottom to fit and not to close the top of the carafe too tightly.
Things I like:
1. It brews fast but still produces good coffee.
2. It is very easy to clean.
3. It is simple to program and has a bright display that can be seen while standing. On my previous Krups, you had to get eye level with the display to read it.
4. It is easy to pour the water into the unit without spilling - much better than previous coffeemakers I have owned.
Things I don't like:
1. The brewed coffee could be hotter. I mean as soon as it is brewed, not after sitting for a while.
2. The stainless steel vacuum pot does not hold heat nearly as well as a pot with a glass liner. We use Zojirushi thermos pots at work, plastic exterior with a glass thermos lining that will keep a single cup of coffee hot all day. I have never seen a thermal coffeemaker designed for residential use with a glass liner. Typical form over function.
Given the same selection, I would buy this again.

Title: Third time was not a charm
Content:
We have purchased 3 of these coffee makers.  The first one we purchased worked for 2 or 3 years and we really liked the fact that there was not caraffe , I do not like burned coffee flavor.  I replaced it with a new one and started having problems within a month.  Stopped brewing called the company and was told to use vinegar brew etc.  Repeated this multiple time with no effect.  Sent coffee maker back.  Before this happend we bought our daughter the same unit and she has had to return hers as well and was given a big run around from the company because she is living overseas (son-in-law) is in military.  I had to contact a consumer go between to get some results.  I will no longer purchase from this company.

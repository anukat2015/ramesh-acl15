Title: Promising Camera But Underexposure Is An Issue
Content:
My new XTi underexposed & I've since learned that others have had this problem. Be aware of this correctable problem. Canon agreed there was an issue with my camera after I sent them a series of photos & histograms. Their service center gave fast service & appear to have corrected the problem. I've long used digital point & shoot cameras (Olympus & Kodak). This is my first SLR. I went to an SLR to get faster shots & hopefully greatly improved low light shots. The XTi certainly solved my need for faster shots. Initial evaluation of night/low light shots show great improvement over the non-SLR cameras. Photos of nightime lighted Christmas trees are not as blurry. Too early in the evaluation (plus I need to upgrade from the kit lens) to say it fully meets my desire for good low light shots. 
THe underexposure problem (both indoor & outdoor shots too dark) could be compensated for by increasing exposure by +2/3.

Title: Problems are easily resolved.
Content:
As an avid music listener, I purchased the mp3 player with the most  bang for my buck. Thirty gigabytes for $209 (at the time) was incredible. I also recieved $50 off my next purchase (a printer). Although I dropped the player and it suffered from a hard disk problem, it was replaced for free even when it was well out of warranty. Now, I have abused my headphone jack enough that it is having a problem. As long as I get a new one back for free, I'll be happy. 
The software isn't great, but there is a perfect alternative - Windows Media Player! Just rip all tracks into WMP and put all your downloaded songs into the library (select the songs from "My Music" and right-click "Open" them. After a little time playing in WMP, the songs are in that library. Use the Sync tool in Windows Media Player and it is ready to go - sends in very quickly too. Plus, you can burn your music for other people easily for people with other audio formats (converting iTunes into wma is tough). Creating playlists are easy using the Creative MediaSource Organizer program.
This product is an incredible price for 30 gb. You can export other items like documents as long as the program is installed at each computer. It is rather large, but as a guy with pockets and a car - size isn't important - it still saves room from cd's and cd players. Size is a problem, as well as durability. But everything else - even the controls, are very good. Not perfect, but the best for the money - hundreds less for the same size from  Apple! A great investment for me, and hopefully for you.

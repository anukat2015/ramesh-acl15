Title: It's loud..but has great suction
Content:
The vacuum has great suction and works great on the rug and floor.  I have a area rug and I had used my old Bissell on before the new one..the old one seemed like it was done I used the new one and I still had to empty the new canister almost 2 more times..The only bad part is that it is very loud.  It has a very loud whistle and when you use the small vacuum attachment that is also loud..I was afraid of waking up my daughter from her nap upstairs.  Also, the second time I used it I had vacuumed the floor and there was no pet hair in the canister..It was very odd since I bought it for the 2 cats I have..  the filter light turned to red so I pulled out the filter and there was all the pet hair that was not in the canister...Over all it seems to do what it supposed to do I just have to empty the filter and canister alot..

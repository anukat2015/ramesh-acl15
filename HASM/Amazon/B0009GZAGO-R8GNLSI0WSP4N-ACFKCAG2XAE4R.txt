Title: First impressions
Content:
I have owned two Nikon cameras, the Coolpix 3100 and 3200.  They were both just good enough for taking a few pictures.  I wanted to upgrade to something with more zoom and more pixels.  I started to look at 8 megapixel cameras with 6 - 8x optical zooms.
Then I went to Panama to attend the 4th Summit of Heads of State and/or Government of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and the official ACS photographer had the Coolpix 5700.  I used it and looked at the pictures it produced.  They mostly seemed to be dark and you had to wait too long before you could take another picture.  I did not have an opportunity to read the manual and play with the camera.  It did not feel right.
I bought the d50.  I have used it for 2 days.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who had a simple point and shoot camera who wants to move up.  I have not had the chance to read the manual past the 24th page.  I have not read about going to manual features and tweaking settings.  I will...one day.  In auto mode, the camera is just great.  I am sure that the more advanced users will get more out of the camera.  I have already gotten exactly what I needed to start with and I have a lot of room to grow.

Title: Gotta Buy This!!
Content:
Let me start off by saying that I was amazed at how small this thing is. I bought the IPOD MINI.  When I got it and opened it up I was amazed at how small it was. It was crazy small!  Plus it holds around 1,000 songs.  Right now I have about 500 and it's a little over half-full on the memory. I got a 4GB IPOD MINI.  So, there is plenty of memory space for lots of songs.  The software was easy to install.  I thought it was tricky figuring out how to select songs and actually put them on the ipod.  But after a while I figured it out.  Also the volume on the ear phones is amazing. I almost blew out an eardrum by accidentally turning up the volume!  The only problem i've had so far with the ear pieces is that the foam ear pads keep coming off the earbuds.  NO biggie though.  I would recommend getting some sort of case to protect this thing since you've already paid $200 bucks what is another $20 to make sure it's safe!  There's plenty to choose from.  Charging is it easy, you just plug it into the usb port and it automatically starts charging it.  I have a computer so it's no biggie.  If you don't have a computer with a usb port its gonna be tough finding a place to recharge it.  I haven't tested the battery life yet, but it seems to be ok.  Probably more than what i need.  Lastly, I was a little worried that the songs would not transfer over to the itunes software. I have lots of songs that I got elsewhere :) I hoped they would transfer over to the other software and they did. They also sound great, the play fine. It's not a problem at all. Now i have over half of my music collection on this thing.  It's a really great product.  5 stars!!

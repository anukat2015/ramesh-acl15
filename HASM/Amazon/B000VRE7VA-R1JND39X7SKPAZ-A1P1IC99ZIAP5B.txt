Title: Great semi-pro camera, great value.
Content:
A FREE color temperature analyzer included (which would cost $1,200 separately)! As I describe below, there is a little discussed feature that allows you to set the white balance for the ambient light practically perfectly.
I have had my Sony Alpha 700 for about six weeks now, have used it extensively on a vacation, and have tried most of the features.
I'm impressed with:
- the solid "feel" of the camera build
- the 5 frames per second continuous shooting until the card is full (many other more expensive cameras have a limit)
- autofocus is blazing fast, and as reviewed in PopPhoto, is faster than even the best Nikons and Canons in good light.
- there are several ways to access almost any setting or function, and seemingly endless customization of settings.
- Though the Auto white balance isn't always as accurate as I'd like, there is an amazing feature with will allow you to set an custom white balance in a mixed or difficult light situation by using a gray or white card and having the camera "read" the light. It not only gets the Kelvin temperature right, but also adjust to Green/Magenta filter color casts from G9 to M9. To get that quality ambient light sensing, you would have to buy a $1,200 Color temperature sensor (Minolta made one). So basically you get a color analyzer for free with the camera.
- I have quickly gotten used to the separate buttons for the setting I adjust most frequently: Drive setting (for bracketing or time delay), White Balance, and ISO.
- The Dynamic Range (DR) Capabilities are phenomenal. I've shot photos in horribly contrasty situations and been able to get detail in both shadows and highlights. There are 8 levels of adjustment for DR.
- The information you can get on playback is extensive and useful when you press the "C" button.
- I love having a % of battery life left, but I hated having to have to sell my old batteries from my Alpha 100 because they won't fit due to the new feature.
What I don't like:
- the little "joystick" control is difficult for me when I try to press it to confirm a setting. Otherwise it works fine directionally.
- I've found that I get better exposures with a -.5 EV compensation. The histograms are almost always perfect in that situation.
Overall, it's the best value in a semi-pro (bang for the buck) that I've come across after extensive evaluation. I'm also confident that Sony will continue to market it's DSLRs seriously and continue to offer a wider model line. Sony has staying power and marketing muscle. So far it only has about 6% of the worldwide DSLR market, but I'm confident that will grow due to the quality and value of it's camera product line, including the Zeiss lenses.
Another thing to note:  Sony makes the 12 megapixel sensor for the Nikon D300, and most likely they are the same.  Compare the price of the Sony A700 with the D300, and you will see the "bargain".

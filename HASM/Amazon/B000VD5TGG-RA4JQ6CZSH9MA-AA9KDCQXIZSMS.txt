Title: Good deep cleaning.. parts could be better
Content:
Purchased this for a home with mostly tile, a few area rugs, and dogs that have occasional accidents. The deep cleaning and hardwood floor fuctions are EXCELLENT - best unit I've seen for actually removing pet hair and not spreading it around. Carpet deep cleaner also works amazingly well. As with another review the vacuum is only so-so and I would recommend keeping a small upright on hand for large carpet areas. 
My only real MAJOR complaint with this unit is that some of the parts are kind of flimsy. The deep cleaning attachment broke after a few uses, but was cheap to replace - about $15. We also had an issue with one of the hoses springing a leak, but were able to repair it ourselves.  Overall, I would recommend this unit, but only to those who are able to take good care of their things - you have to maintain this unit well (empty tank, rinse parts, etc) for it to continue to work well.

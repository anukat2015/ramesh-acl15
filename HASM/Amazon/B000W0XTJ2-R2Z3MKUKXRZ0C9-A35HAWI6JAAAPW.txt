Title: EXCELLENT PURCHASE...
Content:
At first, I wanted to buy this laptop directly in the HP webpage because I wanted to configure it, but several problems on that page made me look in Amazon for a similar product, and the tx1320us was the solution. The only negative point is the battery size...it stands out in the rear part of the notebook and makes it a little heavy, but still....the weight is perfect. Perfect buy and 100% recommended

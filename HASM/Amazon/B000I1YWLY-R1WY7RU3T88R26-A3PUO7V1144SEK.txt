Title: Ideal for plush carpets
Content:
This is an ideal vacuum for ultra plush carpets.  We recently got a 75 oz carpet.  It was really difficult to push around our Hoover Windtunnel upright on it.  Also, it was difficult to get into the nooks and crannies.
I looked over all of the available vacuums and decided that I needed a canister vacuum with an adjustable height power head.  Also, it should be bagless because the new carpets is shedding a lot and fills up the bag every time I vacuum.
I decided to get the Electrolux because one of our previous Electrolux lasted 20 years and the Twin Clean got very good reviews.
I really like it.  It is much easier to maneuver over the carpet.  I can get the head easily under tables.  The unit is so light that I often just carry it around.  The self cleaning filter seems to work OK, but I only tried it once.  I still fill up the storage container every time I use it, but it is very easy to empty.  I really like the self retracting cord.  I can adjust the height with a toe pedal.  All of the controls (power on/off, power brush on/off, suction force) are on the handle.
The only negatives is the power head has too many joints and is hard to steer.  The holder for the extra nozzles isn't very secure and the nozzle keeps dropping out.

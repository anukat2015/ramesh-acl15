Title: I broke the power switch
Content:
This was a christmas gift last year. I was so happy to get a space heater, as I am always cold.  It was a gift so I cannot complain to viciously but I am a little disappointed with this space heater.  The space heater could be better at keeping the temperature a bit more constant maybe if the sensor was better. The larger problem is that I broke the power switch on the machine. The nob broke after several uses and now i cannot change the intensity of the oscillation or turn off the heater without unplugging it.  Luckily I broke the heater in the on position so the heater still works and it is much better to have a broken switch then no heat at all.

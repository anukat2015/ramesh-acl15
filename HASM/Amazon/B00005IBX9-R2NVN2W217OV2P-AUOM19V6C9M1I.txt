Title: Great Buy
Content:
I needed to replace a Braun which are no longer manufactured. I read the reviews on this cuisinart and decided to give it a try. I could not be happier I made the purchase. It makes great coffee and has simple, durable construction. It has all the features I needed including the ability to adjust the power off timer length and a self clean button. When I read the reviews I saw 2 potential negatives that made me hesitate. One was that the power cord is too short and the other was that the place to pour in the water is too close to the grounds. The power cord is about 12-18" shorter than it should be but worked for me and I don't have any issue filling it with water. I definately recommend this coffee maker.

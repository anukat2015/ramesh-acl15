Title: excellent heater, some quirks
Content:
This is an excellent heater.  As others have noted, it does have some quirks.  I'll describe those first.  It does require some assembly and the manual is not great at describing this.  The remote controls most, but not all, functions.  Importantly, it does not control the timer.  On the unit itself, the function buttons occur in a black plastic circle around the temperature display, and those buttons are labeled only with black icons.  Black icons on black plastic buttons is pretty much invisible.  I dealt with all those quirks on the first day.  We use it to heat a large bathroom with a cathedral ceiling.  We set the timer every nite to come on before we wake up.  We've used it a month now.  It works reliably, does a good job, and is relatively quiet.  As a heater, it's an excellent product.

Title: Mark
Content:
Unit has worked perfectly. Easy to install and easy to program. The one option that really stands out is the energy monitor button that allows you to see how long the system has run today, yesterday, last week, and the entire season. No more suprises at the end of the month when my bill comes. I am very pleased with my purchase.

Title: Best Vacuum I Ever Owned
Content:
This vacuum is just great! It it extremely light weight, easy to push/pull around. The cord pulls out really far. The vacuum also has brushes on both sides of the main head piece which makes it easy to pick up the dust/dirt around the corners of your floors. This is the best home purchase I have made in a long time...

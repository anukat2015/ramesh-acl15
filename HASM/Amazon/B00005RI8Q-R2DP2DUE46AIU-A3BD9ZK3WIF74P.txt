Title: Fast, beautiful and light
Content:
The latest iBooks are pretty much the opposite of the very first Blueberry and Tangerine iBooks.  They have a faster system bus, much more RAM, much bigger hard drives and they've lost the garish colors.  Perhaps most importantly, they've trimmed all the fat off making the iBook almost a sub-notebook.  Despite this, they're loaded with features and are the perfect laptops for student or business person wanting to travel light.

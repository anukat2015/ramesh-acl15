Title: Great Heater
Content:
Having retired a Pelonis Oil filled radiator heater this past spring due to bad switches, we considered a micathermic heater from Soleus. It had mixed reviews. We decided to try this DeLonghi and after this first week we are more than satisfied with it. The heat begins immediately. We keep it on a lower setting (1 '750w'/ 2 or 3 thermostat) and our small living room is more comfortable than we imagined possible. It is very light and rolls easily. The only assembly is one screw in each floor roller mechanism. The only issue was that the first heating created some outgassing from the materials. It has no odor at all now.

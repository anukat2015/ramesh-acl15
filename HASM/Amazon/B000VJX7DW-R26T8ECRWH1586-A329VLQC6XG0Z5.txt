Title: Moving from D80 to D300
Content:
At first it felt a bit bulky but as I got used to it, it just felt right. The quality of images is perceivably way better than the ones I took with the D80, and that was a camera I loved.
Lot of parameters on the D300 menu to play with though, so it makes for a significant learning time.

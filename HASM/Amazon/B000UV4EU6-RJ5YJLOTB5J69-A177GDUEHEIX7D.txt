Title: Best MP3 player I have owned
Content:
Over the past 5-7 years, I have bought 3 or 4 MP3 players, with varying degrees of satisfaction. This is by far the best one I have ever owned. The software interface and button layout are extremely intuitive and easy to operate. No touchpads, but rather actual buttons that make a tactile click when you engage them. This unit is especially good for audiobook listeners like me, because you can set as many as ten bookmarks, and access them easily by programming a customizable button to open the bookmarks screen. Another real bonus for me as a 3-time grandfather is that you can also store and display videos and pictures on this unit, and they play and look great on the screen.

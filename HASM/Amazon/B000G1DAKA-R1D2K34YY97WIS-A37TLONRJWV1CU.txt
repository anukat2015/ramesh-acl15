Title: Pentax Revisited
Content:
This is a wonderful camera. I have the 35mm ME Super with a selection of additional lenses. The best feature for me is the backwards compatibility for all of my lenses. They work perfectly except for the fact they are not auot-focus. Not what I wanted anyway. I moved up from a Kodak point and shoot. The end result ...an excellent level of picture quality the Kodak will never attain. The features are comparable to that of Nikon and Canon at a fraction of the cost. I don't see the need to pay for those names. I use the diffence in cost to help me justify buying another lense.

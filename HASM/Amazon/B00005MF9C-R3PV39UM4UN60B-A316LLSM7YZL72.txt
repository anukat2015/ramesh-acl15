Title: Black & Decker Brew 'n Go - excellent one-cup  coffee brewer
Content:
We have used one of these for years. We have another we take on trips. And, we have given several as gifts. It's the simplest and best one-cup coffee brewer we have found. And it is inexpensive. Our original one has never failed, but we do have a water filtering system which may be partly accountable for its longevity (?). In any case, we try to keep an extra around in case one goes bad. You cannot readily find them in stores. Glad to have found these on Amazon.

Title: Great Canister Vacuum, Very Lightweight
Content:
The Sebo K3 Canister vacuum cleaner is the lightest weight canister with power nozzle on the market. Weighing in at 12 lbs., carrying this vacuum up and down stairs is a breeze. The wheels on the canister seem a little cheap for Sebo's standards, however I haven't seen any repairs on this yet. I really haven't had any repairs at all on Sebo, period. The only thing you will want to be careful about is vacuuming up the cord with the power nozzle. The brushes spin very fast, and will damage the cord quickly. This vacuum is VERY highly rated by our customers. Expect a good 25 years of service.

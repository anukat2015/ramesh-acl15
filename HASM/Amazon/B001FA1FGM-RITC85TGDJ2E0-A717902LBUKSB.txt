Title: Quiet and warm
Content:
We purchased this heater for our office during a cold snap in Florida. We are in a large warehouse space so we didn't expect it to warm the whole space, but we stuck it under a desk and the warm air was diverted horizontally to keep us warm. It ran so quiet I would have to look to check if I had turned it on or off.

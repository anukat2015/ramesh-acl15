Title: Slick look, pretty quite operation
Content:
I've got this conditioner from Lowes, and I also got Maytag 9000 Btu Portable Conditioner from HomeDepot. I put them both in one room to compare. 
Kenwood's fan is weaker then Maytag's but we descided to keep KW85 as it's less noisy, and it is important for us, because it'll be placed in baby's room.

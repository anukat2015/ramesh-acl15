Title: Love it.
Content:
We love this coffee maker.  It is so wonderful to wake up to freshly ground and brewed coffee.  We never have a "burned" or "old" taste to the coffee, as it is stored in a thermos.  The only negative is that we have found that the coffee maker only lasts a couple of years before having to be replaced. Otherwise, it is definitely an A+.

Title: Great feel in hands and quick shutter
Content:
This is my first DSLR, but not my first SLR.  I've owned the Prowershot Pro70 and the G3, and the Rebel XT is a great value in the DSLR range of products.  The basic lens that comes in the kit is adequate and will suit most beginners, but I suggest getting the body and spending some extra money on a decent lens for those who are familiar with SLR's.
Great camera, and I'm sure it will last me for a couple of years while I brush up on my photography skills.

Title: Software is too buggy!!!
Content:
Can't believe Microsoft released this crap software. The software was a real pain for me. Now my Zune software has trouble seeing the Zune player. Apparently other people are having the same problem as me reading the complaints in the internet. Even if i don't have this connectivity problem, I would still feel like beta tester for the Zune. You're gonna have problems if you reinstall Windows, reinstall Zune, or install the software on another computer. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! I regret buying this crap. Go for the Ipod or Sandisk Sansa.

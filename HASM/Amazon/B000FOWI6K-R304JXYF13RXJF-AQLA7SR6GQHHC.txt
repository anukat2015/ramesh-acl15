Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
Totally broken after two hours. The software drivers provided and available online are bugged out. The install disc is one of those little mini cds they used to give away on beer boxes in 2002.
One of the products you would not buy if you could actually see it instead of the photograph.
A shame because the flash drive mp3 concept was nice. Maybe going to get a shuffle or nano as a replacement gift for a friend.

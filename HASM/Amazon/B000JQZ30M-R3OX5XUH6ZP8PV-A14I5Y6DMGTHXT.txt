Title: A high quality heater that looks like a work-of-art!
Content:
This Lasko heater is very stylish and well-built, has excellent controls and thermostat, good heat output, and oscillates (if desired).  It's really one of the classiest looking heaters available, especially in this medium price range.  And even though a cheap, white plastic utility heater will, realistically, supply the same heat output, someone who purchases this Lasko unit will do so for the look, build-quality, and pride-in-ownership, rather than just as a simple heater.

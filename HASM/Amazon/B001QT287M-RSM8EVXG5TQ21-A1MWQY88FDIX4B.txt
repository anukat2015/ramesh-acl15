Title: NICE CREMA!
Content:
This espresso machine makes wonderful crema, 15 bar pump makes it perfect, I was thinking to get me a Gaggia Carezza, but it was $100 more of what I paid for this one, while the results are the same (or better if we consider price/quality) the body is plastic, but it is heavy and strong, This machine froths milk perfectly, it creates nice foam before boiling the milk, the frother is low so I have to use a short pitcher

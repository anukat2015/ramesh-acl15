Title: Amazing Power in a Little Machine
Content:
I have always hated upright's and found that finding a good canister vacuum is a challenge.  BUT THIS IS IT!  We did our research and read the reviews and I love this vacuum.  It is very user friendly with a handle on the pipe as well as having the power button right there at your fingertips. No more turning it on with my toes.  The long power cord easily extends and retracts, no pulling or repulling to get the cord to lock into place.  The attachments are stored ontop in a little compartment unlike my old vacuum where they sometimes snapped onto the bottom of the vacuum. 
It works absolutely wonderful on both carpet and hard surface floors, just switch the power head on for carpet, off for hard surfaces.  The dirt cup is easy to clean and after dealing with trying to find bags for a vacuum that the manufacture doesn't make anymore, it is a relief to not have to worry about buying bags that fit. I would rather empty a dirt container every time I vacuum than have to buy bags and cut them to fit.  
As for power........let's just say that upon changing attachments it literally sucked the attachment onto the pipe. I have NEVER used such a powerful vacuum.  Believe me you don't want to accidentally suck up your shoe string because it will probably do a number on your shoe!
It is not too loud and it is still light weight. It is not too bulky but is compact.  The only thing I wish was better is that it would roll a little easier on carpet. Other than that I couldn't ask for a better vacuum.  Trust me you won't be disappointed.

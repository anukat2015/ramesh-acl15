Title: Amazing cleaning machine
Content:
I purchased this vacuum because I had read so many good reviews.  Unfortunately it did not work out of the box.  I returned it to Amazon (as suggested by the Hoover representative I spoke with) for a replacement .  My replacement was at my home 3 days later - a very quick process without any problems.  It picks up dirt and dog hair better than ANYTHING I have ever seen.  I vacuumed with our Oreck vacuum and steam cleaned the week before and was amazed at how much dirt was left behind by both of those items.  I do have to agree with quite a few reviews on here that the dirt cup is very small, but it IS a compact vacuum and will be used in a new apartment within the month.  Definitely a GREAT purchase!

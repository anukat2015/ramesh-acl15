Title: GREAT A/C
Content:
I had an Amcor a/c for a long time and still have it and works great... I decided to get a new a/c since I wanted one with a remote for it since I had lost my remote for my Amcor recently... I love this a/c so far I have had it for a little while and out of the other reviews written so far... I will admit that I did have a problem with overloading the breaker even with nothing plugged in but a laptop and a lamp with a flourescent light...  I had to plug my air conditioner by using an 1875 Watt Heavy Duty Extension cord and have it go out the window to the garage below... ITS VERRRRY QUIET! The heater works pretty well... Just know its not like a regular heater its about a medium temperature heat and will not get to the point where it will burn your fingers off like a normal heater...  The remote is great, though it should be made into a normal looking thermostat that you see on a central air conditioner... The remote reacts differently and is used like a thermostat where it waits like 2 seconds or until your done setting it and then it changes the air conditioner/heater settings... One small problem I ran into were the tubes... one brings in the air and the other vents it out... the one that vents the air out can get REAAAALLY hot and it HAS to be insulated with something wrapped around it anything will do even a pillow case... the air going in isnt as hot but can get pretty warm on hot days outside since its using outdoor air... For this air conditioner I give it 5 Stars and will admit it DOES work!  Now I have not run into the flooding problems like anyone else but I guess we will see... Then again I am guessing its shipping damage!

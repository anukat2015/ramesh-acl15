Title: Works Real Well!
Content:
I bought this for our new house that my husband and I just moved into. We have a lot of laminate floors and carpet, so I wanted something versatile. I always research products and read reviews on them. It seems that most people were happy with this vacuum (none are perfect), and so I bought it here on Amazon. I really like the power that it has, and that it works well on carpet and hard floors. I like the fact that the power buttons are on the wand and that the wand extends so my back doesn't have to bend as much. I guess the only things I don't like are that some of the attachments don't all fit in the canister (but I don't really use them all that much anyway), and that the canister doesn't roll well on carpet. But I read about these issues before I made the purchase.

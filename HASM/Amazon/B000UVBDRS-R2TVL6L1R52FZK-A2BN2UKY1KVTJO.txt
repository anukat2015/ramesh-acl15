Title: great alternative to the iPod
Content:
I bought this as a replacement to the ZenV 2gb which stopped working after about 6 months.  I love the player.  The video quality is great and the sound is awesome ( I use the cheap skullcandy head phones instead of the set that come in the package).  It has FM radio which the iPod doesn't and doesn't require MP4 formatted music like the ipod so I can just use windows media player.
I used to be frustrated by the fact that it only syncs to your outlook calender and task list but now that google lets you sync your google calender with your outlook I can sync my web based calender to my player
I like that you can actually create playlists directly from the player which you couldn't do on the ZenV.
I bought it with the set of three skins which fit perfectly
My only complaint is how easily the screen gets scratched.  They should include the screen protectors with the player or at least with the skins because I put the player in my purse and got two big scratches right away...

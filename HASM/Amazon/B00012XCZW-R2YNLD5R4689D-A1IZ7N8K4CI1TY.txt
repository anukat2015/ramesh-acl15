Title: Finally, The Coffee We've Been Wanting
Content:
Two years ago, we started looking for a new coffeemaker. Most of our research showed that the key to great coffee is the water temperature during the brewing cycle. I read about Bunn back then, but at the time read about complaints of the brew basket overflowing and especially for those who ground their beans. We like to grind the beans right before brewing. 
We chose a Mr. Coffee with a thermal carafe. There were a few mechanical problems, for which the company always responded. The bottom line is, we just didn't like the coffee's taste.An ongoing issue with nearly every coffeemaker we've had is the dripping when pouring into the cup. Very annoying!!    
Our Bunn arrived 5 days ago. We grind our own beans and use a bit under 1 Tbsp. per cup as shown on the carafe. The coffee tastes fabulous. The 10 cups takes 3 minutes to brew. We find the coffee to be very hot at completion of brewing. The taste is superb. Full of flavor with no bitterness. Not a drop drips, dribbles, sloshs when pouring. 
I don't know that the heat unit shuts off automatically. I turn that off 20 minutes after brewing as I don't like the coffee to "cook". 
We are very very happy with this purchase. Silly, in the grand scheme of things, but it's wonderful to start the day with a great cup of coffee.

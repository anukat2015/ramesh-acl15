Title: Disappointing coffee experience
Content:
I bought my first Red unit about 6 months ago; it leaked and exploded in use; returned it for refund and picked up another, a black one, at a retail store--I really wanted to like and use this machine. After 5 months of use, I have the following comments: (1) the volume delivery of coffee is inconsistent; sometimes the "large cup" setting delivers 8 oz; sometimes as much as 12 oz; sometimes it only gives 3-4 oz, and once it overran the cup. (2) even though I tracked down the best available coffee pods, and the coffee was 'ok' it was never 'really good'. There's no lovely coffee smell. There's no anticipation of a really good cup of coffee, only an OK cup of coffee. Never great, sometimes good, often mediocre--all using the same setup and the same pods. The only good thing about this machine is that it looks good and it's sanitary to use. But after all this time, I've decided that life is too short to drink mediocre coffee, and I got myself a high-end superautomatic machine from Europe. Now THAT's great coffee.

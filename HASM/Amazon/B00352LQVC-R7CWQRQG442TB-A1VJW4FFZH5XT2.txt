Title: 2nd time is a charm
Content:
ASUS was recommended by three computer geeks that I know and so instead of re-DELLing I thought I'd try the ASUS.
The first one I purchased was a total lemon.  It starting crashing (blue screen)about a week after using it and their very helpful tech peeps couldn't figure out why.  I sent it into their tech center and it was returned "repaired".  Unfortunately it had the same problem so I sent it back to Amazon.
I loved the layout of the keyboard and the feel of it so a purchased another identical model (risky and unusual move).  This one works great (so far, one month into it).  I think the first one was just a lemon-it happens.  
Both Amazon and ASUS made every effort to "make it right" and I'm satisfied!

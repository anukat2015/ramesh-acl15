Title: Great!
Content:
I'm a big fan of the Zune. This one was for my wife and I have a 120 gb myself. It's great! I had a i-pod once but it died on me one day and never came back on. I love that it is compatible with the x-box 360 playing both music and video. The software as simple enough and its easy to edit your music as long as you have the artist and title or at least the artist and album name and track number. and it will do the rest for you. Finding the album art and song names. I would recommend it to anyone and I do!

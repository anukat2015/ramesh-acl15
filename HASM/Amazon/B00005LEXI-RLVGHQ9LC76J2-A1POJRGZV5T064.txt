Title: Mr. Heater Portable Propane Heater
Content:
My husband and I bought this portable heater after we went through one power outage in northern California.  It is so breezy and cold up here during the winter that not having a heat source for even a few days was horrible.  Now, with this particular propane heater, it keeps whatever room we were in nice and toasty without the use of central heating.  We moved the heater from the living room to the bedroom at night and stayed warm.  It's safe and easy to use.  Highly recommend it.

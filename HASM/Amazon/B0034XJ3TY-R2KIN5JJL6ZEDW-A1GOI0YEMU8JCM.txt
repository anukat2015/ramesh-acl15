Title: Simply AWESOME
Content:
This laptop is simply awesome for the price. Lots of upgrade potential for the future too. 
It has two hard drives, so if you want to add storage in the future you can replace the second hard drive without needing to mess up your windows installation. 
The LED display has the edge-to-edge glass which looks fantastic, and is much nicer than the typical lame glossy coating. The edge to edge glass is usually a minimum of a $100 upgrade from their competitors. 
I priced out other configure to order laptops and wound up getting prices between $2000 to $4000 without even getting everything this laptop has to offer. 
Something else I find amazing... This laptop has a two year warranty, with 1 year accidental damage included...BUT if you register for the warranty within 60 days they'll give you an extra year of accidental damage. Go to a competitor and see how much that costs, you're looking at a minimum of $300 extra just for the warranty. (2 year premium protection from "big blue" for this price range is $449).
Another great thing about this laptop is the hand rest area. Yes, it keeps cool, but that's not as nice as the soft feel of it. It's just plain comfortable to use.
We're professional graphic and web designers, so we needed something with great power, great graphics, and great comfort. This laptop has it all. I rarely write reviews for something I like, but this laptop deserves the praise.

Title: Concerned after 17 months of usage
Content:
I purchased this unit 17 months ago in October 2008 to replace a similar unit that failed after about 14 years of service.  Installation went smoothly and it's very easy to program. Initially the unit functioned as described....  then one day this winter we came home to a very cold home. Apparently the batteries failed without warning, yet the display was functional and there still wasn't a low battery indication.  I replaced the batteries and all seemed to be fine... until this week.  We're on our 3rd set of batteries this week after each time coming home to a cold home. Each time the display is functioning just fine, the programming is in tact, there's no low battery indicator, etc.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it, but when I select the temperature warmer and "return" there should be the sound of a click (the relay) then the furnace should activate.  When I replace the batteries, then all systems are operational again.. for a day or two. This happened again today. Today after all attempts to activate the furnace failed, I again replaced the batteries. Again, a fresh set of batteries successfully engaged the relay in this unit.  These are name brand batteries.  Each pair has been from different brands from different packages. All are new, freshly bought. 
I'm very concerned and most likely will end up replacing this thermostat.  Save your money and buy a more reliable unit.

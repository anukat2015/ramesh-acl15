Title: Excellent Product
Content:
I received this product as a gift recently and I absolutely love it.  I have an older model (ipod nano generation 2) and this one has much better improvements.    
The design is very sleek with no buttons sticking out.  I was surprise of the size of it; very small and could be carried around easily.  The screen resolution is great with vibrate colors and text can be easily be read.
The controls are very simple: just slide your finger on the wheel to select your music and press play.  I love how the button are clearly labeled; it's very intuitive.
The graphical interface are easy to understand.  You have a main menu to choose from:  Music, Video etc.  The songs are listed in order for easy access.  My old Nano ipod doesn't play videos and with this, watching movies on the road is a blast. 
The give this produce a 4 stars out of 5. It would be nice to have an expansive slot for increase memory and a compartment to replace batteries.
Overall this product deserves high recognition.

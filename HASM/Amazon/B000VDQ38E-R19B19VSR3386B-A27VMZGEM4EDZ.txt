Title: Can only do one job
Content:
With two cats and a dog I thought this would be a great purchase but I was wrong. It is AWFUL for anything but pet hair. It shoots everything else straight backwards at your legs, which is especially irritating for things like loose cat litter. I end up using the hose to clean up anything but pet hair. It also weighs about 100lbs. What a waste of money.

Title: RUN AWAY!!!
Content:
You might be tempted, Cuisinart typically makes great products. But, unless you actualy ENJOY cleaning your coffee maker for an hour every time you make coffee, and unless you LIKE having coffee grounds floating around in large quantities in your cup, this is NOT the machine you want.
In fact, it's so bad that after about 4 brewing cycles, you'll pack the stupid thing up and give it to some poor, unsuspecting friend or family member, who, after about 4 brewing cycles, will realize why you gave it to them. Then they'll cuss you, and pass the coffee maker off to some other poor sap. Eventually the damn thing will make the rounds and get re-gifted back to you, and you'll be exactly where you started.
So, to save yourself, your friends, and your family a whole lot of time and heartache playing hot-potato with this stupid machine, take my advice... PICK OUT A DIFFERENT COFFEE MAKER!!!!!
By the way, every time you make coffee, you will swear the machine is going to explode. It makes the most violent, disturbing sounds I've ever heard come out of a healthy piece of kitchen equipment. Seriously. Horror-movie quality sound effects...
NOTE: this is a true story, up to and including the re-gifting part... when I got the damn thing offered back to me, I had to post this review. CAVEAT EMPTOR! (or TEMPUS FUGIT or QUID PRO QUO or some other goofy Latin phrase))

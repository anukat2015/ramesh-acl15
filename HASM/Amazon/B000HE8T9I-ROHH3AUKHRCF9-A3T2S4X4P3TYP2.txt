Title: worst vacuum ever!
Content:
Buyer Beware! This is NOT comparable to Dyson. We have had so many issues with this vacuum it's not even funny! We recieved this vacuum a year and half ago because we registered for it for our wedding. We have had  nothing but problems since. First, this does lose suction. If you have a dog, it will lost suction. If you have carpet, it will lose suction. As others have said, it is very difficult to clean and we can't seem to keep up. You shouldn't have to clean the insides of your vacuum every other time you vacuum, yet that's why my husband has to do. We keep our house very clean, but since this vacuum fails to pick up what it's supposed to, we are vacuuming every single day multiple times to try and keep our carpets clean. We've had so many issues that the company sent us the same vacuum again. For a while, it worked great, but we were still cleaning it out like crazy. Then, it started acting up just like the old one. I've determined that this machine is just plain faulty in itself. I'm currently in talks with the company to get my money back. This vacuum is a fake and they play off the Dyson slogan "never loses suction" to get you to buy. Guess what, it worked! After all the headaches, I'm going to fight to get a refund and buy a Dyson! Lesson learned. DO NOT BUY!

Title: Awesome vacuum
Content:
I absolutely love this vacuum.  I have always had a Hoover upright vacuum and the latest one we own, did not pick up much of anything on my floors.  We got new carpet in our bedroom last year and finally am now able to clean it properly with this new vacuum.  The only thing I have to say negative about it is that the canister is small and needs to be emptied quite often, especially with pets.  But overall, I love it.  The power it generates is wonderful.  Amazon's price is a great price also!

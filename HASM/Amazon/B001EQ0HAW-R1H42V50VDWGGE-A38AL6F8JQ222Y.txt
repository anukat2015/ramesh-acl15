Title: I like this product...
Content:
More than enough space for all your audio and video files. The software is fairly intuitive. If you set up parameters to suit yourself, you can keep the Zune from copying all your audio and video files and just add the content you want. The sound quality and the large screen are excellent. It is great for watching full length movies.

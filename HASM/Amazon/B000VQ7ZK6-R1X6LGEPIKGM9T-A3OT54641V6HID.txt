Title: Very happy.
Content:
I have had this player since January now. i have absolutely no complaints.  it holds all of my music, pictures, video, any text files that i want to view, it has games( which do get a little boring after a while but hey they take the edge of the boredom off), and a bunch of little apps like a calculator and a world clock, there's much more than i want to write.  i haven't gotten a chance to use much of the blue tooth functions ( you can pair headphones or you can pair you bluetooth phone with it and make calls with the p2 itself), but i have paired my phone to it and it works great. there are tons of options for music and video playback (more for the music).  also there are near constant firmware updates that keep adding more and more functionality. the screen takes some getting used to but it works great after you do  
Overall:
    A GREAT personal media player that has tons of great functionality.  i highly recommend this to anyone.

Title: SUPER VACUUM
Content:
Believe it or not, but this is the 3rd Dirt Devil 082600 Vision Canister Vac I have purchased thru Amazon!!! So, I must be 100% satisfied with it.It is a super vac, great power,easy to change the floor attachment to the carpet attachment and easy to empty the bagless canister. My husband even commented how good a vac it is, so I bought one for the garage and basement for him !!!! It is a heavy unit so I am leaving one up and on the main level of our home. It has a long cord so using it on the steps is not a problem.I love it and recommend to all!! For the price it is the best vacuum on the market today, believe me, I have tried the other brands and this is the best!!

Title: Okay for bare floors
Content:
I bought this vacum because I wanted one that was light weight. It is very light and easy to carry/pull around. It works good for vacuming bare wood floors. But you need to use a light touch when operating. Don't push down while vacuming...let it lightly go over the surface. I only use it on the carpet when I am doing a light clean up. It is not the vacum to use if you want deep thorough cleaning for carpets. But for the price it was a deal and works good for my everyday pick up in the kitchen/dining area, where it is only bare floor.

Title: Great Heater
Content:
This is a great heater, I use it in a camper.  It puts out great heat and on low will last 7 hours.  If it gets too warm, then you put it on Pilot and so it is easier to turn it on later.
It can be used with a 20 lbs. tank and will last almost 4 days (on low), or use it with a 100 lbs. tank and get 3 weeks out of it.  Just a great product.

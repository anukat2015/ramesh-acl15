Title: Great camera
Content:
Overall, very impressed with this camera.  All my old lenses are compatible and picture quality is superb.  My only complaint so far is that my old speedlight doesn't appear to be compatible.  I am still experimenting with it, but so far i have had no luck.  One of the things i have been most impressed with is the battery life of the camera.  The sleep mode works very well and has no impact on the usability of the camera.

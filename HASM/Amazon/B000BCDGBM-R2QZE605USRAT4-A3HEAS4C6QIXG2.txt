Title: Terrible Piece
Content:
This is a total waste of money. I'd give it a negative rating, if I could. The thermostat is manual - and painful to set. In my unit, the thermostat doesnt work - When its running, I reduce the temperature knob just to the point where it turns off - assuming that a temperature just below what its running at will be maintained. It never does.
I wouldnt advice anyone on buying this.

Title: Puzzling, to say the least....
Content:
Like everyone else, I found the absurdly tiny opening for the water is a royal pain, & certainly drags the rating for this way down. After setting it up, impressed with the features, & price, I couldn't even see where the water should go, and looked to the instructions, which weren't much help. I finally realized, that despite a huge lid, which is only for the filter, the opening for filling was a tiny, narrow slit towards the rear of the unit. This is way too small, and not only must you be a great aim, but it's quite awkward maneuvering the carafe to enable it to fully empty!
I truly cannot believe that someone, or ones, were paid to "design" this model! What were they thinking???
Oh, well, this is the third coffeemaker I've bought recently, the first two were even even worse, so I'm still undecided if I'll return this, or just live with having to be ultra-precise when filling it.....

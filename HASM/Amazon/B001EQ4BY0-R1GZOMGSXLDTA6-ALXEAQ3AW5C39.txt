Title: Love the 50D
Content:
I love this camera.  It would be a bit much for a true beginner to handle, the menu's are confusing and if you don't even know what aperture and shutter speed are for, then you may be better suited for a model from the Rebel series.  The beauty of this camera lies in the ability to make it work with you, not for you.
If you do get it, then it's so.easy to use.  I picked it up the first day and don't think I've stopped yet.  I'm not a professional by any means.  I may not even be any good (I only shoot for myself) but I love it.  I got this because I wanted something that would last a very long time and give me the opportunity to learn more about photography without feeling overwhelmed.  This did it.  
I switched from Nikon to Canon because the ease of the menus.  The top screen on this is fantastic, I love that I can see the settings I'm shooting at without turning the LCD screen on or going out of my way to find a settings menu.  It's just as easy to switch my settings too.
I do think that it took a bit to realize that a few of the menus are redundant but I guess that's how this caters to everyone.  I have not used the live view, I haven't felt the need to yet.  I do recommend a tripod if you don't have one. It will only enhance what you do.
The speeds are fast, the pictures are crystal clear and need almost no touch ups except for a few contrast or black balances here and there. I shoot both people and objects and only for fun.  This is only a hobby for me but if I ever get to the point that I want to take it up a notch..I'm covered.
Overall, great purchase and I'm more than happy with it.

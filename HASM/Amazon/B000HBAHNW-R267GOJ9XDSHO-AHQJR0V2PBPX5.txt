Title: Great Sucker
Content:
My second Miele vacuum purchase.  
My first was a canister which I spent about $500 or so on ten years ago.  It was a fantastic vacuum - it would clean without leaving behind a vacuum "odor" like every other vacuum I had had.  The motor and suction remained consistent, and the bags were easy to change.  It lasted until I accidently pulled it down a flight of stairs and the hose snapped off.  It was a model without an electric brush attachment - it just had the non-electric "turbo" brush.
My new Miele - this model - has the electric brush and what a difference it makes.  The electric brush works great.  The differrence is night and day compared to the old turbo brush on my carpets.  Most of my home is wood flooring, but we have a few "persian-like" area carpets and the turbo brush just didn't cut it - even on such short "piling."
That is my simple two cents - if you can afford it, go for a machine such as this with the electric brush if you must vacuum capeting at all.  Miele's are generally fantastic all around - little argument there.  If you don't have carpeting, go for the cheapest Miele canister you can find.  Howvever, if you need clean carpets, you really do need an electric brush and not just a non-electric turbo brush.

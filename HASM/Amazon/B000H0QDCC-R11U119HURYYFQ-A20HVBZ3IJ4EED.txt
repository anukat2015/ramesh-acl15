Title: First MP3 Player
Content:
This is my first MP3 player and I found it easy to use and figure out right out of the box.  I had previously ripped all my CDs (3300 songs worth) into itunes and the zune software converted my entire library and uploaded it to the zune in a matter of a few hours.
I like the control (the ipod button annoys me) and the radio feature works well.
The only complaint that I have about the zune is the lack of supporting accessories at this point.
You will not be dissapointed unless you are a stubborn ipod owner.

Title: Best Vacuum I have ever owned!
Content:
I have two cats and two dogs and even with my Dyson I could never get all the Chihuahua hair out of my upholstery or cat fur out of the carpet.  I read all the great reviews on this vacuum and decided to purchase it based on reviews alone.  I thought I would use it in conjunction with my Dyson but I'm getting rid of my Dyson completely.  Why do twice the work when this vacuum works better than the Dyson.  One tip though: when the front red felt panel is down it works great to pull in pet hair into the machine but if you want to get close to the floor boards make sure to flip it up.

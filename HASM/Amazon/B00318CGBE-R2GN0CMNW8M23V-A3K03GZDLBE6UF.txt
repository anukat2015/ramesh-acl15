Title: Ok for the price
Content:
I think this is a decent computer for the price but remember that you get what you pay for. I would love this computer if it weren't for the fact that the battery sucks and the speakers are really low. Instead of the 4.5 hours of battery life advertised.. It's really maybe 1.5 hours before you need to plug in the charger. The speakers are kinda low which makes it frustrating to try to watch movies or video's. Other than those two things it's a good buy. I gave it 4 stars because both are problems that can be fixed by purchasing additional accessories.

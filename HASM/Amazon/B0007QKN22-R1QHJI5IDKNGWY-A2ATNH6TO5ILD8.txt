Title: Extended support in Aperture an additional plus
Content:
This is an excellent SLR for a very affordable price. If you are a Mac user, you will love the extended support for the Rebel's RAW files in Aperture. 
My only real concern is which EF-S wide-angle lens to choose. I've still got to make up my mind. If you don't need a wide-angle lens, don't bother to think twice. It's worth it.

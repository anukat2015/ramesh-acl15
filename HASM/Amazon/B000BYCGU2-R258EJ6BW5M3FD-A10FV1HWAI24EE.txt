Title: Excellent coffee, but worth the price?
Content:
I found this coffee maker to make really great coffee, but I personally can't see where it's worth the extra $100 compared to my older black & decker.  I like the style of it a lot, it looks great sitting on the counter, and the thermal carafe works great as well, keeping coffee hot for hours.  I also agree with one of the other posts that for this kind of price, I think a removable reservoir really should be part of the design.  Other than that, I have enjoyed it so far!

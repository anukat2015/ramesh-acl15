Title: Great in Most Ways But Don't Like the Toxic Smell
Content:
This heater is excellent in several ways:  it is quiet, heats up fast, is lightweight, it looks great, it has a good thermostat, and is wall-mountable.  The only downside is that I still notice an odor when I turn it on.  I can smell this within seconds of turning it on, and I have had the heater for months now.  I did leave it on for several hours the first time to burn off some kind of coating, as instructed.  The odor  may not be harmful in any way, but it smells "toxic", and I don't want to to take the chance, so I bought that Costco Presto parabolic heater to replace it, which is also silent.  I originally rated this heater 5 stars but now consider it about 2.5 stars due to the odor problem.
One other potential issue is the question of how close an electric heater should be to your body.  You can sit right next to it to quickly warm yourself up in a cold room, but those parabolic heaters would be better for this purpose since they radiate heat at a longer distance.  The manufacturer advises keeping the heater 3 feet from objects on the side that radiates heat.  The heater is designed as a room heater rather for local heating, and it works well for this purpose, minus the odor which I can no longer stand.  There is also a potential health concern about any sort of strong electric fields that are close to your body, so that is another reason to keep it a few feet away from you.

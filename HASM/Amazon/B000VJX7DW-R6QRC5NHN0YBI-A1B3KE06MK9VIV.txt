Title: Nikon D300
Content:
In february of this year, I decided to enter the world of digital photography. I initially decided to get a D90, which I ordered from B&H along with the kit lens (18-105mm VR) After using it for a few months, and getting more and more serious about photography, I decided to sell my D90 and it's kit lens on craigslist and use the proceeds to fund an upgrade to something a little more "professional"--a d300 and the nikon 17-55mm f/2.8. All I can say is "wow!". the differences seem subtle between these cameras on paper (i.e. same sensor, etc.) but once you pick them up and handle each one, you will never confuse them again. The d300 screams professional, while the D90 definitely screams amateur. Not that there's anything wrong with this; If you don't feel you need the advantages the d300 gives you, don't get it. But if you need weather sealing, 6/8 FPS, 100% viewfinder coverage, mirror lockup, a better grip, non chrome shutter release (getting into the small stuff here) and more, do yourself a favor and pick up a d300.

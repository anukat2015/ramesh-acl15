Title: EXCELLENT IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
Content:
We have been looking for a 12 cup coffee maker with a carafe for a long time. We have tried numerous brands, Krups, Braun, Kitchenaid. Etc. and they all have very poor carafes. This carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. After eight hours, the coffee was still too hot to drink. The issues listed in other reviews can be avoided if you slow down, watch what you are doing and follow the directions. We added a little extra for coffee before brewing and the strength was perfect.
We would highly recommend this to anyone.

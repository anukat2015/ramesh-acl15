Title: Become one with the dirt
Content:
Messy, clogs easily, constant filter care. It has good suction when the filters are clean, but the dust and dog hair clog up the hoses and filters within the first 10 minutes of vacuuming. The machine spews dust all over. The dog hair gets all wrapped around the cyclonic filter as well as the bar on the bottom. The filters clog with dust so fast that you have to stop vacuuming, rinse them out, wait for them to dry and continuing vacuuming on another day. All this work for only two rooms of carpet. Dust and dirt quickly cover the outside of the vacuum and get all over you when you go to empty the basket. Its a really messy process. It also gives annoying static electricity shocks. It doesn't clean at all on hardwood floors. Overall a big disappointment. I had a Hoover Windtunnel before and even thought it wasn't perfect and it died after a couple of years, I'd take the windtunnel any day over this machine.

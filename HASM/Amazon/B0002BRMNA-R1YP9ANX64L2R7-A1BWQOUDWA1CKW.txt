Title: Awesome Player, Awesome Price
Content:
I've never had problems with my player and I've dropped it.  I'm run with it and I've taken a couple tumbles and the player has been dropped, with no damage, it was in the belt loop case it comes with.  The space is awesome for the price and good sound quality with better earphones.  Awesome tech support, very polite helpful.

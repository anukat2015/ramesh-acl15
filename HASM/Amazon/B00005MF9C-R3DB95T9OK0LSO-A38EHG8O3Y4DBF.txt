Title: Perfect coffee but mug interior is plastic NOT stainless
Content:
This really does make excellent coffee.  I received it this week and I have not experienced negative issues others reported - no overflow even when I use 3+ Tbsp of ground coffee, no burnt flavor, no long waits for coffee to drain through grounds.  But, my disappointment, the coffee mug is stainless on the outside only, not the inside.  For those concerned about drinking hot beverages from plastic, take note.  The interior of the mug is plastic.

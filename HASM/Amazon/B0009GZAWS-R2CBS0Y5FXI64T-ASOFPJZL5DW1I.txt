Title: Very dissapointed with outcome
Content:
Pictures taken with this camera on the first sunny days of spring produced very disspointing results:
Pics were washed out and underexposed. 
Pics are not sharp enough. 
Additional issues:
Pics enlarged to full size on computer reveal annoying color cast reminiscent of digital video camera frames tranfered to computer.
Camera is very heavy.
Camera takes 2 minutes to process a nigh shot(F priority mode)!!!!! As you wait for it to finish you cannot use the cam at all, all features are frozen.

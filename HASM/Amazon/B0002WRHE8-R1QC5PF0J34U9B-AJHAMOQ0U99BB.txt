Title: Pilot Light Failure
Content:
I bought a big buddy heater and the pilot light always fails in less that 1 hour when running on high. Makes no difference if run with portable cyls. or a 20 pound. Works ok on medium or low but who needs it if you can't run it on high. Looks like lots of other people are having the same problem, plus there is a recall of the heater due to safety concerns. Makes you wonder why the engineers at Mr. Heater don't test their products for a couple of hours to see if they work ok and won't blow up your house.

Title: love it!
Content:
This is the second Cuisinart coffeemaker we have purchased within the year because we liked the first one so much, we bought another for our cottage.  
It makes great coffee, and is easy to operate.  We've had various other coffeemakers that didn't measure up.  
The previous model Cuisinart we own is one step up, looks a little nicer (chrome features), cost a little more, but otherwise very similar in appearance, function, and results. They are both certainly a value for the money. 
I would buy this product again, and recommend it without reservation.

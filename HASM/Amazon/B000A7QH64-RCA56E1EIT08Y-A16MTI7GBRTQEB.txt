Title: much better than the last shark I owned
Content:
I think this little shark is a great little machine, my only problem with it is that the crevice tool is too short.  That being said, I only use this vac in my car and the crevice attachment is too short to get between the seat and the door......which leaves that area dirty while the rest of my car is very clean.  The battery is quite powerful and the suction is good.  I really love the motorized brush attachment because it really works well.  I roll my own cigarettes and work construction so the carpet gets quite dirty in car.  I have never had a problem getting all the dirt out of the carpet with this model.  It usually stays in the car and lasts a long time on a charge.
I totally agree with the review that says don't plug your vacuum in unless it's totally discharged.  These batteries have a memory on them and if you've used it for 1/2 the charge and plug it in, it thinks that that 1/2 charge is a full charge (the battery operated power tools work like this also.

Title: Incorrect Ram Information
Content:
Right from the get go, the product deserves more than 1 star...I gave it 1 to get some attention here.  Everything good you read in all the other reviews is correct great laptop ....but  HERE IS THE REASON I GAVE IT 1 STAR... the information on Amazon is incorrect, it comes with 4 gigs of ram but it doesn't have 4 x 2 gig slots, it only has 2 slots!  Here is the difference if it came with 4x2 gig slots it would have cost me $110 to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs with best quality hyper x gamers ram...but since it only has 2x2 gigs slots it's going to cost me $400 to upgrade to 8 gigs of ram.....who is going to cover the difference? Amazon? I sure hope so ...cause they're hearing from me tomorrow! 
So if you plan to upgrade the ram on this laptop to it's advertized 8 gigs ...you better have $400 laying around cause it only support 2X4 gigs and not the advertized 4X2 gig !

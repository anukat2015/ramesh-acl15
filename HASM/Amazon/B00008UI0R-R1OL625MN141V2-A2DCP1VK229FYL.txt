Title: Powerful, lightweight vac
Content:
I've been using it on wood floors, kitchen vinyl tile, ceramic tile on the bathroom floor, and the bathroom rugs (no other carpet here).  Also, cleaning my walls up to the 11 foot ceilings is a breeze.  Includes a nice variety of attachments, easy emptying dirt cup.  The automatically recoiling cord good be a bit better, but that is a minor issue.

Title: It's good and does a decent job.
Content:
I bought this floor cleaner because I have travertine tile throughout my home and I HATE having to mop it.  It does a decent job of cleaning the floor and absorbing the dirty water.  However, it doesn't do that good of a job on dried stuck on dirt.  I have a 2yr old and a 4yr old so you can imagine what they do to my floors.  So what I've done to resolve the problem is that I spray the area with 409 and let it sit for a minute or so then I run the machine over it and it works wonderfully.  I know the instructions say not to use any other type of cleaning solution, but so far I haven't had any problems.
One more thing, I've noticed that if the filter is dirty it will really affect the suction.  So I now clean it after 2 uses.  I really wish they would've included an extra filter and cleaning pad.  I just ordered the extra kit from Amazon.

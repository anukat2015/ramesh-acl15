Title: I love my D80 but..............
Content:
I purchased the D80 bundle with 18-55mm and 55-200mm VR lens. I absolutely love the 55-200mm VR lens, but seriously thinking about getting rid of the 18-55mm lens. I'm currently waiting for the new Nikkor 16-85mm lens, but it will not be out for another few weeks. 
I have owned the camers for 2 months now and can say that I have made a great purchase. I have taken over 3000 pictures so far and the quality has been great. I recently purchase the SB-800 speedlight to compliment the camera and boy does it. If you are reading this may I suggest that you purchase the D80 with the 18-135mm VR lens bundle. That lens is versitile and I wish I could have purchased that bundle. 
As for the camera body, it is outstanding, and as for the 18-55mm lens well you can be the judge of it. The Nikon D80 is the best camera that you can purchase under $1000 dollars hands down. I have a close friend who purchased a Canon 40d and you can't tell the pictures apart.
At times the 18-55mm lens is slow to focus. I attribute that to the lens and not the camera. The 55-200mm VR lens functions flawlessly. The 18-55mm lens is really cheap because it sells for under $100 and the saying goes you get what you pay for. And as for the camera body..........you get more than what you pay for.

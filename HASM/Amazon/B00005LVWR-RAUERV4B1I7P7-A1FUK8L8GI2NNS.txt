Title: Extremely unhappy
Content:
I am extremely unhappy with this product. It did work well for the first year of light use, but since then it has been a nightmare. 2 times in the shop well over $100.00 at each wack. Parts for it seem to be very hard to get as it takes well over a month for the shop to get it. Communications with factory rep and parts department are almost impossible to get through.Stay away from this item, it is not worth the money.

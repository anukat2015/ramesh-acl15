Title: Good design and handling; lacking suction power
Content:
This vaccum is designed with good ergonomics and with attention to details - automatic power cable retraction, compact storage positioning, etc. It is easy to use and handles well. The swirling design of the vaccum head is a smart touch, enabling the vacumming of otherwise hard-to-reach places like those under the sofa or beds. 
However, it grossly lacks suction power. It might be suffice for bare surface (woods/vinyl) but it does not do a good job for carpet. I often found myself doing multipe-runs in order to pick up some pretty lighweight particle off the carpet. 
Another grievence I have is that the refilling bags are hard to come by.

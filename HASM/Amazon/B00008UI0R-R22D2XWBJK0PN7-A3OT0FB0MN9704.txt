Title: hoover that sucks, as in good vacuum
Content:
this little Hoover that could. strong vacuuming. I like the longer extension cord so I don't have to keep moving the plug. As a lazy bachelor I tend to wait a couple of weeks without vacuuming and so it's, well, chunky.  my only complaint is that the dust bin is too small and fills up about halfway thru the job, requiring me to empty it. I guess it might work better for someone that vacuums more often so there's not as much to be vacuumed up. or maybe it could just vacuum without me?????

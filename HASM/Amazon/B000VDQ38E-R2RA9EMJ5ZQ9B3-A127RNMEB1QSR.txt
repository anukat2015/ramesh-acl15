Title: Worked well... For a while....
Content:
My parents were nice enough to purchase this vacuum for me and my two dogs. Once we finally got it put together and tried it out, I was simply amazed! I have a rug that has a black square pattern and the black squares were literally light Grey from all the pet hair on it. Once I vacuumed it looked brand new! After about 10 uses I noticed it was not cleaning as well as it did when I first tried it. Over a few months it really failed to pick up any of the pet hair in the rug. Now my rug is filthy again and the vacuum doesn't help at all. I'm already looking to get a new pet hair vacuum. Plus one of my dogs accidentally broke it and now it doesn't work at all. I think I had more pet hair than this vacuum could handle. If you have little dogs or cats this vacuum would probably work just fine for you. However if you own giant breed dogs, like I do, that shed a lot, this vacuum is probably not a good match for you.

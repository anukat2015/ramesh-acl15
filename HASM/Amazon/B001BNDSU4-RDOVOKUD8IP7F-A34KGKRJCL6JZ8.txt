Title: Absolutly incredable for the price
Content:
This is a phenomenal laptop. I have had it for two months now and have only noticed one quirk and I believe that to be software related. As for the first negative review I am somewhat surprised as mine came with the reinstall DVD and the option of either having Vista 64 or 32 bit. There are some things on the partition but it is just the usual bloatware that you get on most retail PCs. I just formatted over it and use the extra HDD space. The only thing I wanted from it was the Lableflash software and you can easily get that online at various locations for free. All in all this is a great laptop with tons of features. One of my favorite things is that it has two HDD bays and unlike many other manufactures which would fill both with smaller drives to total the 320 gigs Gateway left the one slot empty for those who would wish to upgrade. From everything that I read they have done the same things for their processor and graphics card. Both can be removed and replaced. That was my one concern when purchasing this Laptop was the underpowered processor. However again that is easily replaced according to everything I read. In the end this is a highly upgradable laptop with a sweet case design and cost $800 less than the equivalent HP or Dell. I have not dealt with customer service but then again I am a geek and usually do all the repairs myself any way. 
P.S. Just for those that are curious about the HDMI and whether you can run the sound through it, yes you can. That was one of the question I could not find answered online.

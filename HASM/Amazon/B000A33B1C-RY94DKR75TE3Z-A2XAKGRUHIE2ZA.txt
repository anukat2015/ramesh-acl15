Title: Works great with ceiling fan.
Content:
Ohio location.  My family room has a large brick fireplace that is always open.  The chimney itself is sealed, but not insulated.  Cool air comes through the opening.  House is otherwise warm, with gas heat.  We got tired of the odors emitted by our ventless gas log fireplace, and tried this.
Though electric can't match the heat output of gas, our 250 sq ft family room is heated very well.  We placed the heater just outside of the fireplace opening, to take advantage of the very slight draft.  We also set the ceiling fan, on low, and at the winter setting.  This pushes the warm air down to body level.  A lot of the heat would be lost without the ceiling fan.  The heat given off is very subtle.  When you walk into the room, after leaving it for a while, it really hits you.  
We considered a ventless gas space heater, but decided against it.  No only can the fumes be a problem, but the pilot light on our gas fireplace, costs $ 20 per month to run, when we didn't start the fireplace at all.  That goes a long way to paying the higher electric costs, which runs us about $ 1.25 for 8 hours of daily use.

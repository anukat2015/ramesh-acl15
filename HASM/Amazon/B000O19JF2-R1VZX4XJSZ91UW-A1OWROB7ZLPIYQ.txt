Title: Shame on Nikon Too
Content:
I have owned, and still own Nikon equipment since 1965. I have taught Photography for 38 years, I get to see every camera on the market through my adult students (post college). I recommend Nikon cameras most often, BUT NOT THIS ONE, this camera only focuses with lenses that have a motor within the lens. That renders all "D" series lenses obsolete for auto focusing with this camera model. This Camera has no Depth-of-field preview button, which is vital to understanding focus. Kit lens is to "slow" to allow you to take a photograph without camera shake, in your kitchen, unless you use a flash. Your kitchen is usually the brightest room in your house. Look elsewhere, with photographic equipment, You get what you pay for. Try Nikon's D80 with a 50 mm f1.8D lens.

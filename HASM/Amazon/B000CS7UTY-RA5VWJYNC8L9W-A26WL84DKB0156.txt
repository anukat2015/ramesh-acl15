Title: No Fast Forward button
Content:
My preferred use for this player is to use the "Random Play All" feature - that way I can have fun listening to a surprising music list of the 14,128 songs I have loaded. Unfortunately, when it is in the 'Random Play All' mode - there is no FastForward button if by chance a song plays that I don't want to listen to at that time.
Rather - hitting the upper left button simply re-loads all the tracks and re-starts the Random Play All. I wish it just had FastForward like my 60GB Creative ZenXtra has.

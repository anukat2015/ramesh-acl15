Title: good student computer
Content:
first, i am not pro spending a lot of $$ on laptops w/ technology changing so quickly. laptops need to do their job w/out breaking.  
i purchased this 14" acer 4810-4508 in november for my college student son.  he is thrilled w/ this computer because, he says: the keyboard is identical to apple's (i read somewhere they do use the same manufactuer's keyboards but don't know if it's true); looks are important to him and this comp is fine; hdmi interface so he can use a tv as a larger monitor; he does not need a mouse; lightweight/portability; sound is good tho he bought some external speakers; has internal dvd drive.  it's fast enough to watch movies/utube/hulu,etc-- has no problems to date.
i chose it for him because it is 64bit, 3ddr, expandable, has mic/webcam for skype and includes internal dvd.  also, i got a killer price at microsoftstore for $520 during black friday.  for myself i bought the toshiba t135-1310 from amazon.com /$599 because it has comparable features but is a bit more portable since it fits in my purse as it is 13". 
both computers have comparable features & speed but the toshiba has hard drive stablity  sleep/charge mode.  i can't say one is better than the other but both meet our different needs.

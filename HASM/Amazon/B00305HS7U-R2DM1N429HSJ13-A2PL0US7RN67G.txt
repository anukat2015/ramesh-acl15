Title: Great laptop for my son
Content:
I purchased this laptop for my sons 17th birthday.  He had been wanting a laptop to play World of Warcraft on with his friends at each others homes.  I decided on this one because it has an ATI Radeon HD4200 graphics card and a decent size, 500 GB ATA Hard drive and 4 GB Ram that is upgradeable to 8 GB and the bonus of Harman Kardon Speakers as well as a large 18.4 inch HD screen.  I've been told to upgrade his Hard drive to 1,000 GB, but I haven't and so far my son says it's not needed.  He absolutely loves this laptop.  He says that there is no lag at all in game play, sound and sight are great and even though it is a large laptop he doesn't feel it is to bulky to sit with and use.  He's played movies on it and has used it to play movies and games on the big screen TV and it has been remarkably easy to use and terrific to watch.  We didn't add any additional speakers as the sound is just perfect as is. It comes equipped with Windows 7, but all other programs that it comes with are only trials so keep that in mind when purchasing this computer.  I assume most computers only have trials, but some have full versions.  I installed antivirus programs and spam programs, but other than that nothing.  It is a nice gaming computer with a mid $700 price range rather than the upper $1,000 price ranges of other gaming computers with about the same abilities or even in some cases a bit less.  I am very happy with this purchase.

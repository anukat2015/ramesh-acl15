Title: basic computing....
Content:
Purchased the Acer Aspire 5532 from Best Buy in November. Great value, you get what you pay for. Out of the box, it's attractive dark blue, nice size & the display is vibrant and clear. All I need it for is email, lil surfing, MS Works word processor, works great for those things. The mousepad as one reviewer pointed out is very persnikity, it will drag on you and the pointer will end up where you don't want it. Speedwise it's pretty good, Windows 7 runs really smooth, I like it alot. After approx 2 months on this thing, my ac adapter/power cord went kaput! I can only use it on battery power which of course is now drained, not even enough juice to even make a light glow. Highly disappointed as Acer customer service/tech support is non existant, or so it seems. It looks like I will be returning to Acer at my own expense for possible repair. I think it's a good deal for basic computing only, and be very careful with the power cord/settings once you lose battery power there is no getting it back on!

Title: Just what I needed
Content:
Its July 09 and my friends basically advised me against getting the D40, they said id rather buy D60 or the other higher end ones.
To begin with, let me tell, i am not an expert photographer, but wanted to get into the DSLR world with a basic camera.After reading significant good reviews, and mostly kenrockwell's site, i thought of giving this camera a try.
Added bonus was that its so light, and almost like a P&S camera.After taking a few snaps, i will say i dont regret at all buying this.I will hopefully learn a lot on this before stepping on to the higher end Nikon's.The photos are crisp and definitely look much better than my other 8 MP Canon Powershot camera.
For most purposes, you wouldnt NEED anything more than this, 6MP is pretty clear, and if you are on a budget like me, look no further.I did delay buying this a lot after debating which one to go for.
Like many say, spare the cash and buy more good quality lenses.Once you learn and become somewhat of an expert on metering,AF-E etc, then you could buy other cameras.
I dont understand how people can be fooled into buying 12MP DSLR camera, when they cant even do basic metering/exposure settings and mainy use it to do AUTO setting shots.
But dont think that this one doesnt do good AUTO mode photos, its really good.
Good luck in your search of The DSLR,
Syed.

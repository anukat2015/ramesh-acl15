Title: Item has not yet been received...
Content:
...and neither has a refund.  This was my second try in ordering a Walkman (for my fiance 1500 miles away) from TigerDirect.  The first attempt returned to their factory.  I was forced to cancel my order, get a refund, and reorder the item.  TigerDirect attempted to charge me $15 more than the price I originally paid.  I waited on the phone for 20 minutes before they agreed to let me reorder the product for its original price. 
The second item was delivered to an incorrect address and I have yet to receive the Walkman.  The fact that UPS can't find the shipping address isn't TigerDirect's fault, but their customer service representatives were less than helpful.  TigerDirect finally (grudgingly) initiated a search for my package, but I have heard nothing since then and have not gotten a refund.  I finally bought a Walkman at Walmart and sent it via USPS to my fiance. It arrived before noon the next day. 
I won't be dealing with TigerDirect again.

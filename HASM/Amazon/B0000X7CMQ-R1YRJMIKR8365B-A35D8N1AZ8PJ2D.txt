Title: bad data
Content:
the write-up in amazon for this coffee maker is terrible. nowhere is the capacity given. The model # ends in 15 so we believed it had a 15 cup capacity when we ordered it. No it is not, it is a simple 10 cup size. too tall for a small capacity.insulated cafe works well for a while.

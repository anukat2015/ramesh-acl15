Title: Outdoor fan
Content:
Good, solid product. Assembly required and that can be a little challenging, since some of the cast iron base parts did not exactly match up. A little force and a bigger hammer worked. The bolts could be longer as this would simplify matters! Once set up works great and makes our deck habitable in August. Well worth the price.

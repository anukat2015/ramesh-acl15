Title: Disappointed
Content:
Krups XP1500: We bought this model as a replacement for a similar model that served us well for 10 years. Coffee was not good and we believe the thermostat stuck because it just went on heating getting hotter and hotter. We also were disappointed in Amazon because they did not offer the same model with a timer and more features.Sent back for refund, which actually cost us an additonal $12 because we could not get the same freight rate that Amazon received. We live and learn.Krups XP1500 Coffee and Espresso Combination Machine, Black

Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1 MP
Content:
I have owned this camera for over two years.  It was an upgrade from a point and click camera.  I will never go back to the point and click.  I do not have any camera of this quality to compare it to.  It has been easy to learn to use.  What I like most is the ability to control everything manually. The clarity of the photos are great.  I have been able to blow them up and maintain the clarity of the photo.

Title: Really good vacuum
Content:
This vacuum is much better than I expected.  Our last one died after about 4 years and granted it was abused and not well maintained.  But a lot of that was due to not really being a user serviceable vacuum.  This Hoover came with a manual that gives complete descriptions on how to replace all the parts/belts!  That alone will make me more likely to attempt to replace the parts.
As for operation we've only had it a few days.  It is easy (logical) to use.  Suction is amazing.  We have primarily hardwood floors with several floor rugs on which it works real well.  Very strong suction so the smaller rugs seem to easier to vacuum on the lowest suction setting.  
Oh, and did I mention quiet?  This vacuum is significantly quieter than any other we've had.  Certainly helps with not freaking the dogs out.  Sheba lays there looking at it instead of running off.  
Update: Aug 6 2009
A month later and the vacuum is still working and has good suction.  One thing we have run into is the pet fur from the Great Pyrenees clogs up the brush roller.  We have to manually clean out the long fur with the little cleaning tool they provide before each vacuum and sometimes once again during the same vacuum session.  Obviously if you don't have dogs with long fur this may not be a real issue.  Still impressed with the amount of dirt it does pick up which is why the canister has to be emptied so frequently.

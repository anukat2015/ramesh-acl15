Title: portability
Content:
I like small laptops, but unwilling to compromise on performance so the EEE category is not for me. The X200 is just that, light weight, small dimensions, powerfull enough for internet/office/others, and it has great pricing right now, without worrying about small HD's or weak processor.
It was shipped just as ordered, arrived on time from ANT and there are really no complaints. Why 4 stars and not 5? This specific model is not the best of the series, and it might be wise to add another 300$ or so and get the slightly more advanced models of this type.

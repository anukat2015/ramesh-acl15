Title: Super tiny - a runner's dream...
Content:
I love this little gaget.  I just got it a few weeks ago and think it is amazing.  The sound is great (I did get better headphones) and I have no problem at all with the battery life.  This is a RUNNER'S DREAM!  Clip it right to your running shorts or tuck it in a key pocket...awesome!  I believe it is actually, quite possibly, weightless.  
My only wish, if it were to magically become the perfect device, is if they can keep the same size/style and get an FM tuner.  I don't need the screen or any other fancy play-list gagets...but for us runners who have to resort to treadmill running in the winter, it would be nice to tune into the TVs sometimes at the gym...just a thought.
Overall, I love it...thanks i-pod for this genius design.

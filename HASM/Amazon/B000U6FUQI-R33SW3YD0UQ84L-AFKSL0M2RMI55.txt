Title: Awesome!  I love this vac!
Content:
I was getting sooo tired of dragging our regular household vac into the kitchen, bathroom, etc because it is bulky and hard to maneuver - it also doesn't clean hardwood or tile floors well.  Mom & dad bought me this for Christmas and it is the best gift I've gotten in a long while.  I can zip through the kitchen, dining area, and basement (all hardwood) in a matter of minutes and can carry the vac with one hand easily to go up & down stairs - or even vacuum the stairs easily too!  Oh, and it's nice looking too. Love love love it.

Title: Get an ipod or a Zune.
Content:
I havent used this mp3 player in over a year. It wouldn't play and erased almost all of my songs I downloaded from Rhapsody saying that the songs were not licensed.I gave up trying to use this thing. I guess you get what you paid for. I guess its worth it to spend $200 to $300 on a mp3 player than $100.

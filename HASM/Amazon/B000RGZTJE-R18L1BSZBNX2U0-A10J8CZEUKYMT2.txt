Title: Works fairly well, but made too cheap.
Content:
I bought this cooler to try to use in my truck (big rig), and it does help some as long as it isn't super hot.  It helps if I leave the windows down a little to let in a little fresh air so it doesn't get to humid inside, and therefore quit cooling.  The remote control doesn't work even after I got another remote from the seller.  I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of sending the whole thing back to exchange it.

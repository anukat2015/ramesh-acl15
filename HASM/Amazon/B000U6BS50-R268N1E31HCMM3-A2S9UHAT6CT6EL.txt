Title: can't replace battery
Content:
I have had my Broom Vac for 2 years.  I have toddlers and I use it every other day.  It works great for my hardwood floor.  HOWEVER the battery has stopped fully charging and you can't replace it so after only 2 years I have to junk the whole vaccuum.  Not worth it!

Title: Eight months of bliss with Zen V
Content:
Yes, eight months of total satisfaction and bliss with the Zen V.  THEN the joystick snapped off.  It's still a great little player, but now I must use a strong fingernail to navigate.  I checked online for other Zen V owners with broken joysticks, and found others who have had the very same problem.  I went to the Creative Technologies Web site, but it's too much of a hassle to enter all the information they require to obtain technical support, and my problem did not match their listed common problems.  Joysticks are delicate, but so am I!

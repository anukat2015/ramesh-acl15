Title: Works great when it's warm outside
Content:
The Lasko 758000 is attractive as far as modern heaters go, but I get better performance from a $15 utility heater I got from Wholesale Liquidators. I was excited by one of the reviewers who commented on the effectiveness in a poorly insulated room, and that's why I purchased it. But too bad, so sad...even with my (old & inefficent) furnace running, this heater cannot cut the chill in a 200 sq foot room with one window and 10 ft ceilings. Could be defective? Runs noisily/sluggishly on the colder, windier nights. The attic is above me, the apartment below is well heated. There are two entrances to the room which I have covered with insulated curtains. My utility heater is in a slightly smaller bedroom with two seriously drafty windows, and it keeps the space uncomfortably warm. It worked well in the living room even before I got the curtains, so I guess the utility goes back to the lr and the Lasko comes into the br. The utility seems to have a more powerful fan, which is perhaps why it heats more effectively.

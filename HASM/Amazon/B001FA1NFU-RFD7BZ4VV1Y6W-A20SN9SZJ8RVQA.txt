Title: Best Price
Content:
The Ipod NANO 4th generation was the first Christmas gift I purchased, so I was concerned, at some point, the price would be cheaper locally or on line. I continued to monitor this, and believe it or not, the price I paid on Amazon was never lower any where else. And, it was my son's BEST Christmas gift. He had lost his original Ipod in a robbery and was very pleased to receive this new, updated version. He was intrigued by the small, thin size and on 12/16 downloaded all his tunes he had been saving until he could purchase another Ipod. It was a hit. And, the product works way beyond my son's imagination. Thanks, Donna

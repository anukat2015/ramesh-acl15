Title: My honest opinion...
Content:
If you like strong coffee (as strong as I make it any way), single serve coffee makers are probably not for you.  The K-cup has a measured amount of coffee.  Therefore, if you make the "small" size cup, the coffee is stronger.  And if you make the "large" size cup, the coffee is weaker.  I tried different types of K-cup coffees and none of them were great.  I tried the K-cup reusable coffee filter with the locally roasted coffees that I do like, and they were too weak.  I tried fine-grinding these coffees in an attempt to make stronger coffee, but then the filter plugged.  Eventually I returned the machine for a refund.  I was very disappointed in its performance.  But like I said, if you like weak coffee, then this machine (and other single serve machines) should work well for you.
Now if I just want a cup of coffee, I use a small 4-cup Cuisinart coffee maker that cost $29.  It makes a perfect cup of coffee as strong or as weak as I want to make it.  I don't know what I was thinking before. I guess that I got caught up in the hype.
Besides, it not like the Keurig doesn't need cleaning and water added.  It's hardly more time consuming using the Cuisinart.

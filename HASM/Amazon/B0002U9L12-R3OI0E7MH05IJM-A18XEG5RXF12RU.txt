Title: great coffee maker until....
Content:
This was, for about 18 months, a wonderful coffee maker. The thermal carafe kept the coffee plenty hot (and it WAS hot) and its price was very reasonable. However, it has lately begun leaking all over the place. The problem is steam condensing at the top of the filter compartment, condensing, and running out and down so that that is a puddle on the counter every time. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why it took so long to start doing this, as there is no seal, the swing-out filter is still locking in just fine, etc.

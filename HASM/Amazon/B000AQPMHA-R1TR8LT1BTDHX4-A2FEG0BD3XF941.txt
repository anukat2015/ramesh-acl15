Title: The  best coffee maker ever!
Content:
This coffee machine is great!  It make the perfect cup of coffee.  It is a little noisy though when it is drawing water from the water tank.  It brews 2 sizes 6 & 9 oz, which is nice because some of the smooth breakfast coffees are perfect at 6oz where at 9 oz it taste a little watered down.

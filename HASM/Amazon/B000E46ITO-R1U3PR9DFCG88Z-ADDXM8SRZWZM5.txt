Title: Not for the faint of heart
Content:
If you are looking for a simple to use foolproof espresso machine, choose another.  It is a challenge to learn to use this machine to create a good espresso drink.  It is possible though.  In fact, I have been able to make some of the best I've ever had.  I have worked as a barista for nearly 4 years and never got as good a result on the commercial models.  
If you are up for the challenge, there is one important thing to keep in mind:  the filters are very unforgiving.  It is crucial that your coffee is ground perfectly for espresso or you will spend hours trying to unclog the filter (a tedious process involving a device that amounts to a pin being poked one by one into dozens of holes). I had all but given up on this machine when I decided to try a prepackaged already ground espresso.  Normally I would discourage pre-ground coffee in general (due to loss in flavor) but this completely solved the clogging problem. The espresso shots were amazing.  It was the promise of that incredible crema that drew me to this brand in the first place. Finally, I got to enjoy it. You will need to experiment with the proper tamping to get the desired results. Too light and your shot will be weak. Too firm and it will clog.
Foaming the milk is also a challenge.  It seems you must overfill the included pitcher so that some of the milk spills out while you're foaming. If you do you will get the most velvety foam imaginable. 
Is it worth it?  Given the price I might have skipped it if I had known how challenging things would be. Now that I own it I am not sad since I am able to really impress my guests (and myself) with my barista skills by serving the best espresso drinks I (and hopefully they) have ever had.

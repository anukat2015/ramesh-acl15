Title: Great Heater Worth the Money
Content:
Well worth the money for this nice heater. We have a heat pump in our apartment and this heater does a better job keeping us warm then our heat pump does. It really makes a difference. It heats our whole living room/kitchen area together.  Wish we would have gotten one sooner. UPS delivery was a nightmare though. Said we weren't home for delivery three days in a row when in fact we were here.  Other than that we are elated with this product.

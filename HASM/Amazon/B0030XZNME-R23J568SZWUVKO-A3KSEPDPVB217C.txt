Title: Great Laptop - Worth Money
Content:
Its been nearly 3 months since I bough this laptop and this laptop is just working fine and it has exceeded my expectation. I have been planning to buy a new laptop for months and finally I settled for this one. My main purpose for buying laptop is for internet browsing, watching movies, music and playing games... This laptop satisfies all these purpose more than what I had expected.. Certainly this laptop is worth the money and I would definitely suggest this laptop for basic multimedia computing...
Pros-
1) The laptop speakers are awesome. The music is very clear.
2) The HD screen is a next plus. 
3) Battery stays nearly for 4 hours.
4) This laptop comes with windows 7 and windows 7 media center is simply superb.
Cons-
1) The fan makes little noise when any antivirus software or any updates from HP or windows takes place on the laptop. For the money and the Intel T4400 core duo processor this is expected.

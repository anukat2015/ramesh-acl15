Title: Good for the price
Content:
This coffee maker was dirt cheap because of the sale price.  I agree with a lot of the reviewers in that it is a little hard to clean because of the splashing against the top of the coffee maker.  But it is small and functional for those times when you want a quick cup of coffee.  Pretty fast preparation!

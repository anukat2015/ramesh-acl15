Title: Bissell Momentum Vacuum
Content:
Saw this one listed in Consumer Report.  Quite a bit cheaper than the others.  Works great on our carpets.  The clear bagless collection container lets you know how well it works.  We were replacing an expensive tristar my wife bought over a decade ago.  Although it is not built as durable as the tristar, it does a much better job cleaning the carpets.  We could noticably feel a difference just walking bare foot acrossed the carpet after the first vacuum.

Title: Coffee in 30 seconds!!!!
Content:
We LOVE our Keurig!!!! The K-cups can get costly.. BUT you can also save some of your used K-Cups take the foil top off add 1 scoop of your own coffee(but leave a little room on top of the K-cup for the coffee to percolate) and cover with 2 layers of press in seal!!! Walla a new K-cup. I also invested in a coffee mug therm-us. The coffee does not stay hot as long as it would from a regular coffee pot that has been sitting on the burner heating up. But my Keurig coffee is not getting that burnt smell or taste to it either.. The Keurig along with its K-cups are one of the finner things out of life!!!!

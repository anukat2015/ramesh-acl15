Title: LCD SCREEN DIED AFTER ONLY 8 MONTHS
Content:
I bought my Toshiba in August of 2009.  It is actually an A505-S6966.  Everything was fine until a coouple of days ago when I turned it on and nothing but vertical lines appeared on the screen.  I went to their website and called the number they gave to find out that it might cost between $175-$425 to fix the LCD screen problem that I apparently have. I refused to give them a credit card number and will have to call back to get in touch with a case worker during 'normal business hours'.  
I find it sad that Toshiba will not stand behind it's product. As anyone can imagine,I am very dissapointed with Toshiba.  I own two of their laptops but will not purchase a 3rd.

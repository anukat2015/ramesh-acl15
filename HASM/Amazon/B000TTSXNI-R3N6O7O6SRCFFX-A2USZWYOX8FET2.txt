Title: More than paid for themselves in the first month!
Content:
We purchased 4 of these because our large, but older house gets pretty drafty in the winter, and we have extremely high utility bills as a result.  We now have one in each of the kids rooms and two in the living room (very large room).  These will blow nice warm air from at least 4 feet away!  The automatic controls are nice, and the oscillation really helps to evenly spread the heat across the room.  We have had these for well over a month now and as a direct result I can confirm we have saved over $250 on our utility bill just by using these as oppose to our central heat.  Why pay to heat your entire house when you only need it in the areas you are?  This might not work for everyone, but for our large country house we are extremely satisfied!

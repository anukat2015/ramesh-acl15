Title: Works good now
Content:
So far so good.  But the only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of five was that I had to send it back and get another one.  I bought this camera so that I could take very good pictures at my wedding but unfortunately the first one that came didn't have a working flash.  Those pictures came out blurry, distorted and unusable.  So I sent the camera back to Amazon and the next day I had a new one in the mail.  The new one works great and takes excellent pictures, I just wished I had it for my wedding.

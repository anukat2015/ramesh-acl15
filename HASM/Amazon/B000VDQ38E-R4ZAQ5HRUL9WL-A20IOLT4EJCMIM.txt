Title: Owned this model less than a year and a half - not durable
Content:
Edited to add:  I had to come back and add that this product is not durable or reliable.  The power cord frayed dangerously in normal use/storage conditions, and the motor went after just over 18 months.  I definitely would not recommend this vacuum for anyone to purchase, despite its remarkable power at pulling animal fur out of rugs and furniture.  I have kept my prior review below, from just after I purchased the machine in 2008.
We have a long-haired cat and two children, and overall we've been happy with the Pet Hair Eraser.  The biggest drawback is the frequency of clogs in the upper dirt collection area.  I've had to resort to using a plastic chopstick to poke around and dislodge the clogs after each and every use.  Having to vacuum the outside of the vacuum cleaner when you're done emptying it is a little disheartening!
That said, the vacuum is incredible on pet hair on carpet.  This vacuum literally saved one of my area rugs from the trash. The weave trapped cat fur in a disgusting fashion, and no other vacuum could get rid of it.  It was amazing to see how well this product worked.
I would also not recommend this product if you suffer from pet hair or dust mite allergies, due to the mess of emptying the dirt container.  A traditional bag vacuum with a true HEPA filter would be a better choice.

Title: Hot Coffee at last!
Content:
Nothing was wrong with my old coffee maker EXCEPT the coffee was not hot enough.  Altrough the 1st cup of coffee out of this machine isn't as hot as I would like, the subsequent cups are plenty hot because they have time to heat up on the adjustable heating plate.  I learned the hard way that I can't use a coffee maker with a stainless carafe because the coffee is never hot enough for me, even if I put boiling water in the carafe before brewing.  If you want a HOT cup of coffee, go with a coffee maker that has a heating element and a glass carafe.  Also, I like all the setting options available with this coffee maker.

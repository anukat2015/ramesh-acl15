Title: Wonderful Foot Warmer
Content:
I was concerned that this foot warmer would be like a heating pad - that it would not get hot enough and would turn off automatically.  On the contrary, it gets REALLY warm (almost too hot for bare feet), and has no auto-off.  It's not much of a space heater, but if you're the kind of person who has cold feet even when the rest of you is comfortably warm, it's perfection.  Also, it uses less power than a space heater, so you're less likely to blow a fuse (a major problem in my office).

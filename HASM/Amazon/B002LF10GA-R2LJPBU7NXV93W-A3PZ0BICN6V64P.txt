Title: I LOVE my little laptop!!
Content:
I have been using my acer aspire for 1 month and I have no complaints. I had been looking for something small to carry around and this is just perfect! Red is my favorite color so that is an added bonus for me. The only thing I wish it had was a cd drive, so i could load my cds to it and have my music saved and then download to my itouch. I figure it would have to be a little bigger for that and that would defeat the purpose of having such a small laptop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute little laptop to serve as their main computer. After hearing how much I loved this computer, my brother ordered one for his wife. She loves hers too.

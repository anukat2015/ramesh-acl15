Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
I read many negative reviews including repeated descriptions of the coffee not flowing into the carafe but overflowing.  I read one that addressed this - "...assemble it correctly" was his response.  In spite of all the negative reviews, we bought one.  Works great and the carafe keep the coffee warm for a while without the taste deterioration that heated units provide.   We love it and it looks nice so keeping it on the counter does not drive me nuts!

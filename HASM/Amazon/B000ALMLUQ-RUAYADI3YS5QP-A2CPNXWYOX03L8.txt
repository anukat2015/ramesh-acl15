Title: Finally!
Content:
I'm a single, on-the-go, coffee drinker whos career requires long hours and not much free time.  I like quality so I'm picky about what I drink.  I prefer that my coffee beverages are strong and like to have them at home, on the road, in the office, after dinner, etc.  I also like a variety of drink types, which is just one of the reasons why I love the Flavia Fusion drinks station!  Not only can I make a good, strong cup of coffee, I can also make a cappuccino, coffee with chocolate, tea and many other varieties of hot or cold drinks quickly, easily and neatly.  The filterpacks that come with the system make it super easy to create the variety I enjoy.  Finally! Now I can make a great drink right from my home -and I can vary my drink choice with the push of a button. Plus, when I have guests over, they can make the drink of their choice quickly and easily as well. This would make a great Christmas gift!

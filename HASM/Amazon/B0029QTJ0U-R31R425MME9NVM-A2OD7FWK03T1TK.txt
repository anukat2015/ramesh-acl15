Title: Great notebook pc
Content:
I purchased this notebook from Fry's on 9.25.09. I wanted a notebook with Blu-Ray as I have a player at home and over 100 discs. I wanted to be able to watch then on a notebook when I travel rather than dvd. I also wanted a gaming laptop to play some games on mainly Diablo 3 when it is released. The Blu-Ray playback is great and it looks good, obviously it's best when viewed on a huge hdtv, the smaller the screen size the less amazing it looks. The ATI graphics card is good not great I am able to run Bioshock at max settings but most other games are best at medium settings. The screen is big and perfect for movies as it's 16x9 and gaming as well. It's plenty fast and I am only using Vista Premium 64 as my Windows 7 will be shipped to me in the next few days according to Sony. Only complaints are price, you are paying for name brand so you may not get as much as the competition in terms of specs, but this is one sexy looking computer. The major problem for most would be the audio, it's just too damn low. Since I primarily use it with headphones it's fine as it's excellent when you use headphones. If you want to use it without I suggest getting an external speaker system to solve that problem. To sum it up if you are looking for a laptop with a big screen, Blu-Ray playback and able to play the occasional pc game this is definitely one laptop to consider.

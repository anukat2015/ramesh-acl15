Title: Not to good in my opinion.
Content:
In my opinion this camera was not all it was cracked up to be. I took 150 shots at a local park, and i returned it for a Nikon D80. The D80 was night and day over it. Okay so i'm not going by features or lens availability, but just general exposure and sharpness, the D80 far surpasses it. I also tried the Nikon D40 before the XTi, which in my opinion is about the same as this, although the flash was better on the Nikon D40. 
No offense to Canon i'm sure they make some nice higher end DSLR's. I would save more money and get a higher end model or purchase from a store where they have a good return policy so it gives you a chance to test them out.
Best Buy has a 14 day return policy. $600 is a lot of money just make sure you try them all before making your final decision.
I tried 3 cameras over the span of 3 days. My final purchase was the D80.
Good Luck. Happy Shopping.

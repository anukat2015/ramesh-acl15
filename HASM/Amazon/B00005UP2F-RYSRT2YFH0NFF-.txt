Title: Not pleased!
Content:
Definitely defeats the purpose of being bagless... I'd love my old bag vacuum back again! It's extremely messy to clean. Every time I vacuum I have to try to clean most of the dust that accumulates in the filter, or the engine whines and the suction is lost. I've gone through two replacement filters so far. It works great the first time you vacuum after replacing the filter, but quickly get clogged up again, and it's really difficult to get it clean enough to work properly again. My other complaints are that the plastic hose crimps constantly, the attachment compartment is poorly designed and hard to open, and the handle to the dust compartment is right below the handle to carry the vacuum, making it easy to try to pick it up with the wrong handle, and either drop the vacuum, or spill dust everywhere. I bought this based on the good reviews... now I wish I had payed more attention to the poor ones. Buyer Beware!

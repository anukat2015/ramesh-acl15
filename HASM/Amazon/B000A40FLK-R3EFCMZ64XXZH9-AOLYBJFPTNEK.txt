Title: So far, so good
Content:
I bought this for $899 on sale and because of the speed of the processor and the other features think it's a good deal.  I've only had it for a week now, so there's not too much I can say about how it holds up.  I did add an extra 512 MB of memory (the 256 it comes with really slows it down) and find it to be a fast, nice machine.
I don't mind the lack of a 3.5 drive (I do own an external from my old laptop, but don't use it much) and a DVD writer would be nice, but I can do that on my desktop.
I love the built in 802.11 support.

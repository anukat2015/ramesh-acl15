Title: great heater, 5 stars
Content:
Heater is everything it is described to be.  Works great, heats up 2 car garage quickly.  Normally have to shut it down to a single head as the garage becomes too warm.  Very quiet during operation, nearly silent.  The only thing lacking is auto ignition, you need to light with a match or lighter.  I did add a Coleman lantern flint ignitor to one of the heads.  I used the match hole to mount it, and it works great to light that head.  Need to find 2 more around here to add to the other 2 heater heads.  I would recommend this heater to anyone looking for one.

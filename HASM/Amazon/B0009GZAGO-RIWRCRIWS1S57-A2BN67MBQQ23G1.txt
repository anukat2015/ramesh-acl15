Title: Advantages of its own and a great price.
Content:
The Nikon D50 is the company's entry-level digital SLR, with a lot to  like, including simplified operation, improved high ISO performance, and lots of features for one of the lowest prices of any camera in this class. (With any luck, prices will drop further with the introduction of the $999 D80 and the prices of the D70s dropping too.  You can already buy a D50 for $550, which is scarcely more than many less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras.
The 6.1 megapixel resolution of this camera is more than sufficient for most photography, especially if you make prints no larger than 8 x 10 inches or compose tightly to eliminate the need for cropping.  If you can get by without owning the latest and greatest camera, the D50 will serve you well at a bargain price.

Title: Nice piece of hardware but vista is SLOW!
Content:
I really like this device but Vista really limits its full potential. Vista bogs it down. Takes forever to resume from standby mode and takes a really long time to boot up from power up. Otherwise, Sony has cranked out an awesome device. I carry it with me all the time.

Title: Another good one from Nikon
Content:
Theres no need for a lengthy review since Hiram Grant normally covers all the aspects.
The D90 is an amazing camera and is perfect for my vacations and occasional photography needs. Never had live view before but its really nice.
So why only 4 stars? 
1) The AF sometimes struggles with low light close range photos.
2) The video mode's audio doesn't work well when theres wind.
Both are fairly minor issues, but they are issues nonetheless. In any case im staying with Nikon in the long run and the 18-105 VR is a good lens to start with.

Title: Toshiba A505-S6030 is Awesome!
Content:
I am stationed overseas so I had to purchase mine through AAFES(military shopping). When my HP Pavillion TX2510 decided to become a doorstop, I did a lot of research with the S6009 which is sold exclusively to AAFES, 2 Sony Vaio models and the HP Pavillion DV-6. I owned a 17" Toshiba previously and in the end, the S6030 won. I am a true road warrior, constantly traveling. Moving from a 12" to a 16" was not as difficult as I thought it would be. The weight is about the same. Startup is a breeze compared to my old HP. Windows 7 is a blessing compared to Vista. The sound of the speakers and the quality of the video really sold me on the A6030. I listen to audiobooks and watch movies and videos, so I needed a laptop that had the best quality I could afford. The speakers are so good that I don't need to carry an extra set. I set up my Dolby and surround sound for the speakers and boosted the natural bass. The sound is great in a large hotel room. I tested my DVD drive with one of my favorite films, "Without A Clue" starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley. No Bluetooth is not an issue since I rarey use it. If I should change my mind, I can add a small adapter and software later. The position of the keyboard is normal because they included the numerical pad, so everything has to flush left-no problem for me. I loved my HP TX for as long as it lasted but Vista was too frustrating. I wanted to get another touchscreen slate computer, but brands like Fujitsu are so expensive and HP's TM series does not include the DVD drive. I want to carry one piece of equipment for all my needs. This Toshiba series fits the bill for all my needs.

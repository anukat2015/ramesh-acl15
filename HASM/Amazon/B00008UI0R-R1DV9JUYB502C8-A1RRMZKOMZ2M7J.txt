Title: Hoover No Longer Provides Factory Service - Look Elsewhere
Content:
I purchased this Hoover 10 months ago after reading many reviews, including Consumer Reports. In spite of reviews suggesting that the belt is a bit finicky, I purchased it confidently knowing that the machine could be sent to a factory service center within a year of purchase for repair or replacement. Hoover's policy always has been that if a customer shipped one way, the company would pay for return shipping.  
I purchased it at Amazon for $190 shipped and was pleasantly satisfied ... until the belt began slipping after less than a month of use. It was replaced, and it slipped again. It was replaced, and it slipped again. Since the original purchase, I have replaced the belt at least once a month. 
Still in warranty, I contact Hoover about shipping my machine to a Factory Service Center for repair or replacement. I was told that they were in the process of closing their Factory Service Centers, and all would be closed -- if they weren't already -- by 12/31/08. 
I now own a $200 doorstop. I imagine that I will continue to replace the belt monthly or more for a while. But I will never purchase another Hoover product again. 
Look for this one at a rummage sale near you.

Title: Disappointed -- Features sound great, but coffee is lukewarm and not so tasty
Content:
I bought this thermal coffee maker to replace my prior cuisinart -- the cool one where you place your cup on the machine plate and push a bar above it to pour -- simply because I wanted to try a thermal machine so I could drink hot coffee over a longer time period without it being burnt and because it was much smaller.
I'm now sorry that I gave away the old cuisinart. It made much better tasting coffee.
Pros of the new thermal:
1. Nice looking, compact design;
2. Lids, everything, all work fine -- Yes, you have to tip a bit more, but come on people, what's the big deal? And the beeps when it is done are a complete non-issue unless you sleep with it next to your head!
3. If you don't mind microwaving your coffee each time (see below), the thermal feature keeps the coffee from ever getting that burnt taste 2 hours later...
Cons of the new thermal:
1.  Coffee just doesn't taste fresh -- I've washed the pot, changed the filter, used gold and then used paper filters, experimented with the amount and types of coffee -- all a no go. I was away last week and used a cheap glass carafe in the hotel I was staying and it was so much better tasting (and hotter from the get-go) I couldn't believe it!
2.  Coffee is lukewarm and needs microwave zapping even from the first cup. As someone else noted, the 1-4 setting doesn't seem to do anything to improve the temperature, although it's supposed to.
I'm afraid this cuisinart is a dog and, although compact and nice looking, I cannot recommend it.

Title: CAnister vac. review
Content:
Electrolux 3670G Boss Canister Vacuum 12 Amp
I found the size and capability of the vacuum was just what I wanted.  It also had a bag, which I prefer to the bagless vacs.  The one thing I hadn't expected was that it was somewhat noisier than my smaller Mighty Mite (same type vac).  But it is efficient, and I am very happy with the product.

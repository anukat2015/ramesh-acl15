Title: Notebook is nice, but don't hold your breath for the Windows 7 upgrade
Content:
I bought this notebook about 4 weeks ago from J&R.
I wanted a netbook with the ability to play back Hulu full screen. I thought this notebook would hit the spot. It doesn't. Under Vista (with all the pre-installed crapware removed) it still drops frames. But it is a good machine, nice screen, plenty hard drive space, webcam works (even with the new VideoCall HD feature of Yahoo Messenger). 
I was hoping to get Windows 7 (which Acer promises to give as a free upgrade) to see if Hulu will play back full screen, as some people say. I signed up for the free upgrade on November 3rd. I did not received it yet. I tried to contact Mentor (who handles these upgrades for Acer) via e-mail about two weeks ago. They have not replied back. Right now I'm talking to Acer Support to see if I can get this resolved. It does not look good. They sent me back to e-mail Mentor :( .
So, if you buy this machine, buy it for its hardware parts, not for the Windows 7 upgrade.

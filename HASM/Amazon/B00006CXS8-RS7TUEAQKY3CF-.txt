Title: Nothing But Problems
Content:
This player has caused me nothing but problems.  I am sending it back for a replacement (I wish I could get a refund) because nothing in the manual, the online customer support, or the toll help line has made the player work.  The most recent problem I encountered was a screen that did not display anything - I could not even tell when the player was on or off.  I have also had problems with the memory and with the MusicMatch software.  After updating the MusicMatch software, I was unable to change the playlist, and the driver that I tried to download from the MusicMatch website did not install properly.  The memory problem I encountered forced me to reformat the player, losing all of the songs stored on it.  The customer service provided on RCA's website is limited at best, and it generally recommended that I call their toll line.  Waiting on hold for 20 minutes on a long distance call only to be told that they cannot fix the problem is not my idea of good customer service.There is a reason why this player is so inexpensive - it doesn't work.***********************Update: After sending back my first player, I received a brand new one, no charge within two weeks.  The other reviewer who was charged $60 for labor should file a complaint (if the waranty was still in effect) because they didn't charge me a penny.There have been a few improvements in the product, too.  The newer version has an armband that is a HUGE improvement over the old belt clip, and it can now take SD cards even if you're using Microsoft XP - there used to be a compatibility problem that the website promised would be addressed "soon" but never was.  Also, the new headphones will actually stay on my ears unlike the old ones, but I generally use a better quality pair for better sound.  Another reviewer complained about the tuner - I get wonderful reception from my radio.Summary: I feel lucky that the problems I had were fixed, but if it breaks again I expect nothing but headaches.  If you already own this product and yours is broken but still under waranty, there's hope.  If you are considering buying one, don't.

Title: An Excellent Piece of Work.
Content:
Myself, my father, and my grandfather are all die-hard Nikon fans.  Between us, we've bought about every product Nikon has put out in the last 50 or so years.  When I bought this camera last year, I expected no different.
It came down to either this camera or the slightly less expensive Canon Rebel.  Since I chose this camera, I have had the chance to mess around with the rebel a great deal (one of my friends bought one a few months ago), and have to say that the d40x is a far superior camera.  In terms of simple ergonomics, the Nikon's grip is incredible, compared to the somewhat awkward grip on the Canon.  Quality is identical.  The thing that really separates the two, though, is the UI.  The Nikon's menu structure is very intuitive- I never picked up the user manual once.  Compared to the d40, the Rebel's menus are clumsy and poorly-thought-out.
Incredible piece of equipment- really lives up to the high standards of Nikon and Nikon users.

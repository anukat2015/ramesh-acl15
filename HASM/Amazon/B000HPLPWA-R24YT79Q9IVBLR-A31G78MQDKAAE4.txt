Title: Great laptop. Lowest-priced 15" Core Duo laptop  for one day only...
Content:
The lowest-priced 15" Centrino Duo laptop has finally arrived in America. Introducing the new Toshiba A105-S4211 Satelite notebook computer. This baby is fully-loaded (512MB DDR2 Memory, 80GB HD, DVD SuperMulti (+/- R double layer) Drive, Intel® PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (802.11a/b/g), almost similar to the one you find in higher-end models. Not only that they use the same processor, but this one was priced way low than what everyone could predict. I only paid $499.99 plus tax for it.
This laptop was sold only at Best Buy stores. All of them were sold-out in less than 10 minutes of opening store time nationwide. At least 70% of the people buying this only bought this to resell it at a higher price for about $200-$300 profit, leaving the budgeted consumers with nothing. Luckily for me, I bought mines early the week before the sale started to guarantee obtaining one for myself.
It comes with Express Media Player, Microsoft Office 2003 Standard Edition trial, Microsoft Works, Microsoft OneNote, Microsoft Money Trial, Yahoo Music, Napster, AOL, MSN, Spatializer, and Virtual Sound pre-installed into the system. It also comes with a recovery disc. What more can you ask?
According to the deal forums, this one successfully won the award as the top ten hottest-deal laptop computer ever in history, ranking third in the list. There are more than 2,000 posts regarding this model. Own a piece of history.
I recommend this laptop to anyone who does not have a lot of money to spend for a new Core Duo laptop, but, unfortunately, since they were already sold-out because of these greedy resellers bought them all, it looks like that you will need to fork out $200-$300 more for a laptop with the similar specs to this one. Although not fair, this is how we live in society.
Cheers.

Title: Okay, not impressed. Design flaws overlooked by fanboism
Content:
Okay, Apple redesigned its macbook pro line.
Pros: 
-The aluminum body feels solid
-The keyboard feels right and is backlit
-The LED Screen is just superb. Some people complain about this but to me, it is just bright, clear and colors are outstanding.
-Battery life averaging at most 5 hours. Not bad but nowhere near the 7 hours advertised. Not a con bc the battery life is still excellent
-Bootup speed is superb. 20 seconds to boot up and less than 5 seconds to shut it down.
-Snow Leopard is fast and expose makes life easier.
cons:
-First of all, this is the bottom of the line macbook pro. If you wanna do any serious "professional" work here, you won't be happy. 9400M graphics card is mediocre.
-Snow Leopard is far from being stable. Plenty of compatibility issues, especially with Adobe products.
-Safari is a memory hog
-Heating issues. Aliminum dissipates heat better, so I wonder how those white macbooks handle the heat issue.
-Why on earth would the team design for the macbook pro line-up design a vent dissipating heat towards the screen. That WILL cause the premature failure.
-USB ports are TOo CLOSE TOGETHER. If you use a non-bluetooth mouse(which is recommended for a longer battery life) and want to use a flashdrive, you have to choose for one or the other. 
-Minidisplay port. Really Apple? It doesn't even support audio at the moment so why replace the mini-dvi display? Or why not go the HDMI option?
-Glossy screen. Not a fan but if you adjust the brightness properly, it should be just fine.

Title: A user review
Content:
Ok, as an actual user of an Inspiron 1526, I can honestly say that this has been a great buy. This other review that is in this page is not a fair review because it is stating an opinion in general of Dell instead of writing about the actual product.
My Inspiron specks are a little different from the one advertised. Mine, which I had now for 4 days today (8/30/08) has an AMD Athlon X2 1.9 GHz processor with 2 GB of RAM (Insp. 1526 can be expandeble to 4 GB of RAM) with a 160 GB HD, a DVD RW, and Windows Vista Home Premium. This also includes 4 USB ports, Ethernet, Modem, Wireless network connection, IEEE and HDMI ports and 8-in-1 Media Card Reader for your digital camera. I did not include the Web Cam nor Microphone. 
Right out of the box, this machine has performed very well. This is designed for the casual user in mind. The main reason for me to buy this laptop is for writing screenplays. I added Office 2007 and Movie Magic Screenwriter 6. Both work great in this machine.
The system has been stable so far. Video quality is great with the True Life Widescreen display with vivid colors. The speakers are not the greatest, they sound rather tiny, but you do have two headphone jacks (if you're watching a DVD with somebody) or you can add external speakers to this laptop.
The video card is a X1270 AMD Radeon. It can display 3D graphics, but this card is not a good option for any of the new games out there. If you want to play any of those games like Halo 2, Bioshock, etc., then this machine is not for you. 
Now, this machine can play older games, published about 2004 like World of Warcraft, which I can play it at the normal screen resolution of 1200x800 in the ranges of 18 to 32 FPS, which is playable and it looks good. I also have Unreal Tournament 2004 which performs well enough to play it, and and Magic The Gathering Online V3 which is a newer game but it will not tax your video card.
Overall I'm very pleased with this. It is a solid machine that would be great for a writer, student, or casual user who can read e-mail, surf the web, write documents and play World of Warcraft and is on a budget.

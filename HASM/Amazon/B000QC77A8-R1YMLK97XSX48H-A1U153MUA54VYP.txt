Title: Lasko 758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater
Content:
I purchased this heater at my local Walmart store.  I really liked the idea of a digital thermostat.   I have tried it and for a small bedroom (approxiametly 11' by 12'), it works fine.   I also tried it in my living room/kitchen which is about 21' by 21' - it was keeping the chill off, but running a great deal.   It will probably go back to the store. 
 I need something that will heat about 600 sq. feet, but a lot of the reviews do not tell how much square footage the electric heaters will heat. 
  I have an oil monitor, but cannot afford the K1 (kerosene) at $4.79 a gallon in my area of NC, so I am looking to find an electric heater to heat my apartment.  Since I cannot afford the K1, the electric heater will be my main source of heat here in the foothills of NC.  We have temperatures which get in the teens and then usually stays around the low 30's most of the winter.  Yes, I realize the electricity may cost as much as the oil, but, at least it is a monthly cost and not a one time bill of around a $1,000.00 for 200 gallons of oil. 
      I gave the Lasko 4 stars.  One thing I think could be improved is the electrical cord.  It was getting hot to the touch.

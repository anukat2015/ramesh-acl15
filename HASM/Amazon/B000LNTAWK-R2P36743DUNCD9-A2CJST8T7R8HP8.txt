Title: Really good DSLR...
Content:
I found nearly everything in this DSLR. Only i experienced these two disadvantages for me:
1.It exhausts batteries two times more if you compare with D70s.
2.It hasn't an IR receiver, if you want to use an IR remote control, you need to plug an IR receiver to hotshoe and connect it to 10 pin socket of D200.

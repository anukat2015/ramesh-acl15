Title: Otherwise great notebook with one fatal flaw
Content:
Amazing battery life.  Sufficient screen and keyboard with decent specs.  I would love this notebook if it weren't for the touchpad.  By far the worst I've ever encountered!  Makes the computer almost unusable without an external mouse, which somewhat defeats the purpose of a thin and light notebook.

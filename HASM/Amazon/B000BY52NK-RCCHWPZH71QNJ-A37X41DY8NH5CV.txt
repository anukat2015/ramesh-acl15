Title: A Queston of Value
Content:
Very few people are going to give an accurate review of the new Nikon D200, but I'm going to try. I'm NOT going to review the D200 on its own. That's not realistic or representative of how shoppers will seek out this camera. At such a high price, most buyers will have experience with digital cameras and DSLRs and be matching the D200 against other models. This review examines the new Nikon in that regard. IF you are actually thinking of this as a FIRST DSLR, please STOP. This is most likely not a good 1st DSLR due to it's complexity and steep learning curve. Please consider a D50 or D70s or the Canon 350XT which are also in the hands of plenty of professionals. 
All others please read on.... 
The Nikon D200 is fairly advanced DSLR which uses interchangeable lenses and works with the Nikon flash system to produce professional results. It has a lighting fast auto focus system, though this is augmented nicely by the additional SB 800 flash which increases AF accuracy even further. For 1699.00 you know this is a serious unit that can take amazing photos, but the real question that MOST people will ask is this: 
Do I need this level of camera over the D70s or D50 which cost a thousand dollars less? The question can be answered quite simply. If you shoot action, such as sports or birds or any fast moving objects, the D200's speed can serve you well, bringing a higher success rate. For more typical shooting, such as family, portraits and scenic, the advantages are questionable. 
Don't let the higher mega pixel rate fool you. Prints from these cameras look just about the same. The D200's higher resolution gives you more cropping ability, but the D70 or D50 are more than capable in this area as well. The D200's higher ISO abilities are quite limited and this has been a major disappointment for users who have been honest about it. The Nikon D50 is better in this regard, as is the D2Hs. This is a major stumble at this price point. Some users will claim good ISO, but it's not forgiving in the least. 
The viewfinder of the D200 may be the single most improved area at this price point. It's both bright and sharp compared to less models. This is not something to be taken lightly. A bright viewfinder is key for proper composition. 
Handling of the D200 is beyond excellent. Like all of Nikon's DSLRs, the D200 just gets it right in a way than Canon continues to miss. This is yet another reason why people buy Nikon as it seems to be designed by people who actually shoot. The D200 is a work of art in this regard. 
Picture quality is excellent, but this is NOT a camera for beginners. Higher resolution also means less sharp results without proper hand held technique. The D200 also employs VERY mild in-camera sharpening and this should be done in post. This is the polar opposite of cameras like the D50 or Canon 350 which deliver good shots right out of the camera. The D200 was designed to deliver as RAW a file as possible and allow the photographer final say in the digital darkroom. Because of this the D200 requires a fairly modern and fast computer with Photoshop or some other powerful post software that can handle the large files. 
So what you're paying for here is a professional camera with superior focusing and shooting speed. Picture quality is about on par with other DSLRs. While some folks will claim otherwise, ALL DSLRs take great pictures in experienced hands and you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart. Pro's and enthusiasts buy more for handling than anything else. In that capacity the D200 does not disappoint. 
Current Nikon owners take note! The higher resolution of the D200 may expose lower end optics. The D200 must be used with better glass to see it's potential. So we're talking about a serious investment here. I currently use a 18-200VR, 12-24, Tamron 90mm Macro, 70-200VR, 50mm 1.4 and so on. Add the flash, filters and so on all ad up. The cost of a DSLR and lens package can easily hit 5K and the D200 encourages you to spend more. This is not a camera to slap 200 dollar lenses onto. 
In the end, with a D200 sitting next to my trusty D70, I can't say that the D200 takes better photos. What it does do is allow YOU to take better photos. If it had better ISO range it would be a 5 star camera. I've given it 3 stars because at this point Nikon should have matched Canon in this area. And by now Canon should have built a camera with proper handling. Choose your poison, folks, but I must question the value of the D200 for the high ticket price. I don't see 1000 dollars worth of advantage over a D70s. Not even close. 
I feel that the Nikon D70s continues to be the best DSLR on the market for the money....but if money doesn't matter and you are an advanced shooter...buy the D2Xs for 4.5K and be done. I also see the D2Hs as a superior camera even with 4MP. And the D2Hs handles noise far better. Very experienced shooters don't need 200% cropping in most cases.
Does this all mean I don't like the D200? No, it's a great camera. It's just not a stunning value and should be priced at 1299.00 at the most.

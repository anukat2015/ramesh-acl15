Title: Excellent investment!
Content:
After receiving a gas bills of around $250 for two months in a row (and I live in Houston, TX, not in some ultra-cold climate), I decided I needed to do something about the drafts in my house besides just turning up the heat. I researched a number of small electric heaters and finally decided on this one. I have now been using it for about 3 weeks, and even though I haven't received my new gas bill, I am quite sure it will be substantially lower because I've been able to keep the house thermostat low while just using this heater to warm the room I'm in. 
Here is what I LOVE about this heater:
* Design - it is nice to have something that it attractive sitting in your living room, rather than a plain white or silver tower. Plus, it's fairly small and lightweight, and so it's easy to take from room to room.
* Thermostat - this is my absolute favorite part of it. I just set it to the temp I want my room kept, and it will turn itself on and off as needed. I use this in my bedroom at night...it's wonderful!
* Low/high - sometimes I just want a little heat near my feet while I'm working at my desk, and I don't want to run it at full 1,500 watts, so it's nice that it has a lower-energy 900 watt setting.
* Quiet, oscillating fan - this heater is less noisy than most fans or air purifiers...it's a very quiet hum...and the oscillation is nice because it helps heat a wider area more quickly.
* Price - you have to love something that keeps you warm wherever you are, for just $40, compared to gigantic winter heating bills!
I am absolutely THRILLED with my purchase of this heater and highly recommend it!

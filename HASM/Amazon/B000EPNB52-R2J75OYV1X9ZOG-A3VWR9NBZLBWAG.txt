Title: too fragile!
Content:
In my opinion, ipods aren't very good to have. My friend had an ipod and he treated it like a laptop. He bought a case for it, kept it out of the sun, never dropped, scratched or shook it, and looked after it. When he tried charging it overnight, hewoke up the next morning and it had gone to sleep. It wouldn't turn on again, and the screen was cracked. He took it back to the shop, and explained how he treated it, and what happened. The manager said it had been dropped, and didn't believe him when he said it was brand new and he took good care of it. He has sent it into Apple and has asked for a refund. He is still waiting to hear from them. Two of my other friends have them, and so does my uncle and my music teacher, and they haven't had trouble with them, but there have been a lot of problems with other people's ipods. 
And, I'll bet at least half the people who own ipods only have them because they're cool and the 'in' thing to have. Apple has done a good job of marketing them, but in some cases have cut the corners. 
If you want an ipod, why don't you get an iriver instead? The model I have has 5gb, can store photos, has an fm radio, fm recorder and voice recorder. Three things ipods don't have. They have a colour screen and they are at least $100 cheaper than an ipod nano. There has been no problems with mine, nor with the people I know who have them. They aren't the 'in' thing, but you get more for less.
Plus, nanos are pencil thin and I'll bet would snap easily!

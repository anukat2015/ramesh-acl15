Content:
After 192 reviews, I probably don't have much to say that's terribly original, but I wanted to weigh in because this machine annoys the bejeebers out of me.  Consumer Reports just rated it mid-pack, and that's probably fair, perhaps generous.  Here are my gripes:
1) It's challenging to pour water into the reservoir because of its odd shape that tapers at the ends. 
2) If you're right-handed, you cannot conveniently pour water into the reservoir AND see the tiny little indicator on the side.
3) If you grind your own coffee, it's hard to dump it into the filter basket without grinds finding their way into the reservoir.
4) Even if you're careful, the coffee tends to drip out of the filter basket if you remove the carafe to have a cup of coffee before brewing finishes.
5) The materials that the machine is made from really do seem cheap.  Even at $139, the markup on this unit must be enormous!  I'd rather donate my money to feed starving children than shill out to fat cat execs at Capresso.
I have no problem paying for clever design and high quality but, trust me folks, this ain't it -- and BTW, I just checked "Feed the Children," and if you buy an $89 coffee maker and donate the $50 difference, you can provide 350 pounds of food to hungry children and families without sacrificing one iota of coffee goodness.

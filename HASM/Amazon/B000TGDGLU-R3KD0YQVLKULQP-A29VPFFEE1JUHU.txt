Title: takes some time, but it works
Content:
This heater will keep a 15'x15' room at 70 degrees when the house thermostat is on 64 degrees.  It'll take about a half hour to get cooking, but then you'll have quiet comfortable heat.
Not all oil filled heaters are the same....I found out the hard way, returning two Soleus Heaters that couldn't warm milk.  Delonghi is the way to go.
Keep in mind all oil filled radiators I've used get too hot to be around small children, but for adult use they're much better than the noisy fan forced heaters or sunburn toaster types.

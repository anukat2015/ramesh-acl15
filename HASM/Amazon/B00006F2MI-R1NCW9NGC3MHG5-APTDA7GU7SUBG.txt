Title: Good coffee - wicked clean up
Content:
We've had this machine for the better part of four years.  I really only use it on the weekends, so I've never really bothered to try to replace it.  It makes good coffee, it does what it is supposed to, both grinding and brewing.  The carafe keeps the coffee warm.
This thing is a high holy pain to clean.  When it's done brewing, the steam is trapped in the top of the machine (yeah the grinder is there too) and thus the remaining grounds and beans get nice and damp.  To really keep the quality up, you are required to remove the entire assembly and clean AND DRY the entire thing.  If you fail to do this, the old grind will build up and the taste plummets immediately.
Moreover, the gunk builds everywhere in and around the grinding assembly.  I let it go a hair too long and some of the coffee bean oil got into the fitting itself and I had to almost wrench the grinder out with a lever to remove it to clean.
I guess it hasn't been bad enough for me to go out and buy a different machine, so I'll give it two stars.  Look elsewhere.

Title: Excellent canister vac
Content:
Over the years we have been a "new vacuum cleaner every year" family. Since I have been using this over the past two months we have finally found a his does a wonderful job on all types of surfaces, from hardwood flooring to our berber carpeting. The weight of the vac is a definite plus also. Another feauture I appreciate is the indicator that gives a heads up on when the bag needs to be replaced.
I cant think of any cons to using this vac, just a lot of pros.

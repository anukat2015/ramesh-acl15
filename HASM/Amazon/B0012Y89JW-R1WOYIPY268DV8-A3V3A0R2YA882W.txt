Title: rapid focusing and low noise performance
Content:
Thanks to help from Arun K. and Chitra J, I got my camera last Friday. This is my first SLR camera. It impresses me with its rapid focus adjustment and low-noise performance even at area without enough lights. However, the reason I don't give it 5 stars is I found there are three fixed position noise points on the sensor chip of this camera. Fortunately, it is unnoticeable unless I print out the pictures in large size. So this doesn't matter very much for ordinary use. I love this camera.

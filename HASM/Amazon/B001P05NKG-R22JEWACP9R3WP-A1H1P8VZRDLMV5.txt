Title: you need to know the cons of the "pro"
Content:
I used MacBook Pro 13 for half a year. It was joyful.
The things I do like:
1. Sleek elegant design and cool feeling by touching it
2. Very little noice, super quiet
3. Runs windows and MacOS that gives me access to everything
4. super fast shutdown/standby-wakeup for mac os.
5. brightest LCD among all laptop I have used
6. multitouch is wonderful. 
7. SnowLeopard has very little virus.
The things I really DON'T like:
1. Get hot easily playing video or even just browsing simple flash video websites 
   I never have 7 hours battery time. 
   with max brightness and web browsing only, it lasts about 3 hours.
2. the edge of the palm-rest is very sharp and uncomfortable
3. VLC media player cannot play my BlueRay rips from hard drive smoothly on Snow leopard
   but it works well on windows 
4. No HDMI output. even the VGA/DVI connector is extra $39
5. None of my 3 VPN client from Cisco/Checkpoint and Shiva works on snow-leopard. 
   I have to use windows to connect back to my office
6. MacOS's dock is way less useful than the windows task bar.
7. The DVD drive is very loud and annoying
Conclusion: Comparing to highend HP/Sony/Dell laptops, this one has way better design and sweet price.
Dell's Ademo is about 50% more expensive. Most PCs are ugly but powerful, if you don't need that extra power for the same money but you like quiet and fast starup/shutdown, nice feeling and joyful experience.
Then why should you buy a PC laptop?

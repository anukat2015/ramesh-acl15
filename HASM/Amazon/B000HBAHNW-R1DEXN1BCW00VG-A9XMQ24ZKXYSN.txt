Title: my second miele - the first one is 11 years old and still going strong!
Content:
i purchased my first miele 11 years ago after the salesman talked me out of spending [...] for a hoover.  he said that miele construction was of much higher quality for 'only' another [...].  back then i still remember thinking 'wow, i can't believe i spent [...] for a VACUUM'. well, fast forward 11 years later, i no longer live in my tiny apartment but in a 5-bdrm house, and my miele vacuum is still going strong!  i recently finished my basement, so i researched some upright vacuums to handle the carpeting down there.  in the end i decided to use my old miele for that area and bought this one for the rest of the house.  it's much more advanced than my old model (mine didn't have a hepa filter), but i fully expect at least another 10 years from this canister.  i'm sold on miele for life!!

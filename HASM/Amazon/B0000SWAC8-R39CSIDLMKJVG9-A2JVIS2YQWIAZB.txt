Title: Research
Content:
I was quite confused when I first started doing research on electorlux.  My mother, and her mother, have always owned electrolux vacuums.  This electrolux is not the same company that has been doing business in the U.S. under the electrolux name in the past.  The old electrolux has changed their name to Aerus Electrolux.  Electrolux is an international company that states on their website &quot;Electrolux is the world's largest producer of appliances and equipment for kitchen, cleaning and outdoor use.&quot;  In the United States they do business under the familiar names: Eureka, Frigidaire, Poulan, Weed Eater, and now thier upscale brand Electrolux.OK, on to the vacuum.  I bought mine after much research at Lowe's.  While opening and putting the thing together, a small clip that holds the power head on the shaft broke off.  I called the company and they said they would send me a new piece with out much hassle, but then got a call back 15 minutes later saying that since the product was so new, it might take 2 months to send me a replacement part and suggested I just return it for a new one to Lowe's.  My over all experience with thier customer support leads me to beleive that I won't have too many problems dealing with them in the future.My second vacuum unpacked fine and after a couple uses I'm quite satisfied with it's performance.  The carpet powerhead does very well on my rugs, and even does ok on hard floors.  The hard floor attachment is more than a foot wide and makes quick work of the hard wood in my house but is so wide you have to switch it for the corner tool to get around most furnature.  I was impressed with the suction from the vacuum, even before I noticed that I only had it turned up half way :) So I'll try to sum up the pros and cons.Pro:Cool lookingNice cord length and roll up storageWide reach on the attachmentsSmall size of the canisterDoes a good job of sucking up small stuffBags are just more than $1 each (for the standard bags)Easily turn on and off the roller on the power headBoth the hard floor attachment, and the power head easily go under beds and couchesCon:Hard to deteach the hose from the canister for storagePower head won't work on bath matsI'll post again in a few months when I see how it's holding up.

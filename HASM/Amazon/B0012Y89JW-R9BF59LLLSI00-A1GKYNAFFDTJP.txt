Title: Great bang for the buck
Content:
Very capable entry level DSLR. You could get a Rebel Xs, or Nikon D60, but the extra money certainly pays for itself in the long run with a larger sensor, more AF points, and more features. 
First DSLR, very happy with it. Supports all Canon lenses, from budget to luxury glass, and the higher end glass fully exploits the high capability of the camera. 
Highly recommended for anyone getting a first DSLR or looking for a cheaper DSLR without prosumer/pro commitment.

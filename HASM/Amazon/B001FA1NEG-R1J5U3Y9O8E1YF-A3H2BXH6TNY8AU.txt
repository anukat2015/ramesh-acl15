Title: WARNING WARNING WARNING
Content:
The new 4G nanos are NOT compatible with any of the old accessories: speakers, car cables, clock radios, docking stations, etc.  If you routinely listen through one of these devices, please be aware that your new nano will not charge through these items.  They will also burn through your battery because they prohibit your iPod from going into "power saver" mode- and the only way to charge the new iPod is through the USB cable on your computer.   Apple does not tell you this anywhere.  When I complained Apple told me "too bad." They told me all accessories that were compatible are listed on their website.  WRONG- my products are not on the website at all- but is compatible with 4 other iPods we have in the house (including a new 80GB).  The tech also mentioned "currently we have no speaker systems compatible with the 4G nano."  Nice of them to make this public knowledge before everyone upgrades.  
Besides that, the new wheel feels cheap, is smaller and more difficult to use than the wheel on my old 2nd generation nano.  Should have stuck with that- but needed the bigger memory size.  Nice look, good screen colors and viewing, but I just can't get past that all my old systems are useless for this new and improved iPod.

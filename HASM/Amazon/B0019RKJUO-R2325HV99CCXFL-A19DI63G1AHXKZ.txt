Title: Retired it after 2 1/2 yrs
Content:
I used it mostly in the fall and winter time.  It worked pretty well. The thing i like most was that it had a automatic cut off, if it ever gets knocked over.  I have kids so that was a plus.  It heats up pretty quick it doesnt work well in large rooms, but it works more so in bedrooms. I mean dont get me wrong itll heat an entire apartment (600sq ft.) but it wont be toasty just warm enough.  I had to retire mine cause the power cord broke off at the very base of the machine. Maybe from being bent to much, not sure. But a good heater. My next one i want it to be more powerful.

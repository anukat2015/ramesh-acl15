Title: DEFECTIVE FROM THE START
Content:
I had nothing but problems with my new camera. First it would just shut off for no reason, the zoom could not find its mark kept adjusting while just sitting on table and finally the flash would rapid misfire & message would say BUSY up to 3 minutes after one shot. I was hoping this camera would be the one for me. I guess I just got a bad one after reading all positive reviews. Reluctantly I had to return it. That also was Canon's support agent suggestion too. I am glad I bought it from Amazon since they are real good about defective returns.

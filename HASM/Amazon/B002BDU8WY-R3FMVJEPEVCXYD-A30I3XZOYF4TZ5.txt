Title: Pretty good, but could stand improvement
Content:
I'd give it a 3.5, but I can't.  I'm writing this review on the Tosh.  Overall, I'm satisfied.  The keyboard is a lot more responsive than my former Tosh laptop which was so bad, I bought a Logitech USB keyboard to get around needing to use the Tosh keyboard. The screen is really good, crisp with good color.  The actual look of the overall computer is good.  The silver painted keys don't show dust, but the little tiny graphics on the period key and the dash key are not for people like me who are not touch-typists. They're obviously designed by a graphic designer for appearance and are too small. Other complaints are that the speakers are almost worthless.  To hear anything, I suggest you buy a pair of Logitech USB speakers along with this thing.  And while you're at it, get a USB hub.  Two USB ports in this day and age are not nearly enough.  Another complaint is that you have no external switch to turn the Wi-Fi card on or off.  Okay, one last complaint just in case your're buying this thing for the face recognition.  It's not very good.  Something tells me you need to be in a brightly-lit room and be very good at holding your head extremely still.  I found the face-recognition to be unusable.

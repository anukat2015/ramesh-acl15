Title: Works like a charm...
Content:
This vacuum works great on our new house which has acres of tile floor.  It's amazingly quiet and has great suction. The adjustable suction feature is really nice too.  The only negative is the fact there's no convenient place to store the upholstery nozzle.  The small brush attachment clips onto the handle -- it's a little awkward, but not a showstopper. I rarely use the upholstery nozzle, so not a big deal for me.

Title: I love it BUT
Content:
First and foremost I love this laptop! It is great for the things I do every day. I use it to complete assignments and to surf the internet. I have found that though this laptop has HD sound (yes it's awesome) the system speakers do it no justice, they are low and not great quality. I plugged in my earbuds and was blown away!!! I haven't tried it with external speakers yet but I will soon. My second issue is the two USB ports. To remedy that I brought a usb hub. Overall I am loving my Toshiba Satellite L505-E5025. If you are looking for a great inexpensive system, I highly recommend this one. I have the AMD processor and it's working great for me. Consider buying antivirus software and MS office when buying this product because it only comes with trial version of Norton and MS Office 07.

Title: First Digital SLR...
Content:
This was my first DSLR.  Having only known point and shoot cameras this was an excellent next step.  Easy to use, light enough to carry around though can get a bit heavy after awhile.  The lens and features were great too.  I've since added a 70-300 mm 1:4-5.6 IS USM lens and makes a great package.  Picture quality is outstanding - didn't anticipate the significant improvement between a point and shoot and this camera.  We visited Vienna recently and were amazed at the great photos!  A very nice camera!

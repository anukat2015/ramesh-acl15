Title: My choice
Content:
I chose the E-420 over similar offerings from Canon and Nikon because this camera just felt better in my hands. Small, light weight, no big old grip on the right side of the camera. All these reasons are really personal preferences as you really have to get technical to see the differences in image quality; which there are. But if you are like me, shoot a lot of images, print a few 4 X 6s and fewer 8 X 10s, store your pictures on your computer and email pictures to family and friends  now and then, the E-420 will serve you well. Do I need to tell you that you should purchase from amazon.com?    I didn't think so.

Shot a lady's tennis tournament today and the E-420 with 40 to 150 mm lens performed very well. Out of over 300 shots, only 4 were out of focus. The 4 bad shots were the first images in continuous shot sequences. Once I figured this out and pre focused prior to shooting, the problem went away.  Just used the sport mode and let the camera figure out the settings.

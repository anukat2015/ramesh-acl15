Title: Sandisk Sansa Fuse 4GB
Content:
Pro: Sound quality, compact design, expansion capability, long lasting battery  .
Con: Ear bud is not comfortable, PC connector interferes with ear bud connector, file management for expansion memory is nor straight forward.
I have this Sansa Fuze 4GB for several month now, and love it. The sound either from MP3 playback or from FM radio is really good, high fidelity quality. I added a 4GB micro SD, so virtually I have an 8GB device. The device plays songs between two storage areas seamlessly, not blocked as other users mentioned. One odd thing about expansion memory is it will rename and rearrange folders and songs stored in the expansion memory. I have not figured out to what rules it applies, but it's easy enough to find where the songs are.
Other minor inconvenience is the plug for the ear bud is too close to the plug for the PC, so you will have to unplug the ear bud in order to grep the connector for the PC; you will get use to it. Another thing I wanted to mention is the ear bud that comes with the device; sound quality is good but the foam is not as comfortable, and it's not blocking the noise from outside, so no luck with it on a plane. I found that the Apple Ipod ear bug is a better design.
I have not had a chance to play with pictures and video clips.
Overall it is well worth the money spent.

Title: Little Powerhouse!
Content:
I'm a photographer and needed to upgrade from my old 12" Powerbook. The larger screen, better graphics card and overall memory size all combine to make this a great laptop. If you're reading this as someone considering changing from PC to MAC all I can say is DO IT! Once I bought my first Mac I vowed never to return to the impractical, unreliable, dated PC format - all you need is Office for the Mac and everything else is just plain better!

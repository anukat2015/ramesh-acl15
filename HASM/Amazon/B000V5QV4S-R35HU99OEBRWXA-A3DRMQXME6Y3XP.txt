Title: A great upgread
Content:
The 40D is a significant improvement over my old 20D. With more dynamic range, a brighter viewfinder ( which is important because in bright light, when my glasses darkened, I could not read the exposure values in the viewfinder. Now they are more visable.
I also like the fact that you can replace the focusing screen. The vertical and horizontal lines help you keep the camera lined up with the opjects or horizon.
The canon high end lenses are absolutely fantastic. I took a hand held photo of a woodpecker at 20 or 25 feet away and could acually see an insects wings in the woodpecker's mouth.

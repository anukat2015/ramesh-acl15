Title: Really Like Looks but Thermostat Sticks
Content:
Best looking unit that I was able to find.  It is a combination of radiant and convection heater so while is warming the room, it will "throw" heat to where you are.
The rating was set to mid-level because the thermostat sticks in the off position.  Resetting only happens after a hard whack to the unit.  So I had to turn it all the way up to prevent the unit from shutting off and maybe not turning back on.

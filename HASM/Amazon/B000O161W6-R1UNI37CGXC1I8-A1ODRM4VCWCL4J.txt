Title: Underachiever- buy D50 or D70 instead.
Content:
Let me start by saying I am a full-time professional photographer. I shoot purely with Nikon, right now I work with a D300, D200, and I use a D70 for around-the-house photos. D70 gives pretty good quality, and to must people(non professionals), superb quality. It isn't quite the quality of the D300, but is much less bulky which is why it is my go-to camera for home.
The D40 is really quite terrible in my opinion. If you hope to do anything besides shoot auto, you are out of luck, things like ISO, F-stop, and speed are all inside the camera's menu, rather than being on the upper user screen like the other D50 and up. They are trying to sell you on the higher megapixels. Go to: http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm to read about the megapixel myth that camera companies are trying to sell you on. I started out shooting professionally with a D50, and I was able to blow it up photos up to 11x14 for photos of people, and I actually have a two foot by 4 foot landscape canvas from that camera that did not pixelate. 
The camera takes okay pictures, but you'll get better ones and more options from the D50 or D70. The ONLY thing that the D40 offers, and should not be the deciding factor, is that it gives you a pretty large lcd screen. 
I shot around with a D40 that my sister-in-law owns the other day, and it was so frustrating to shoot with. It takes a long time to focus, it's very slow. It also has a delay to taking the picture, like a cheap point-and-shoot camera, vs. the D50 or 70 that shoot quite fast and perform well as far as focus goes. 
 Also, another reason to avoid the D40 is that the auto-focus is in the lens rather than in the camera, so it makes the lenses really expensive (and quite crappy I might add). I don't think the D40 should even be in the "D" line, because it really isn't set up like a normal SLR. It is more like a fancy point-and-shoot. I hate it and I hope that you avoid paying more for less of a camera just because it is a newer model. You can get D50's and D70's used for pretty cheap now, sometimes in the $300's.

Title: This vacuum does the job
Content:
Compared to the vacuum cleaners I have owned over the years this machine is one of the best I ever had. It really does the job, I was surprised what was left in the carpet that my old vacuum didn't get. The power brush works wonders on my carpet. The bare floor attachement is great for my tile and hardwood floors. Keep an eye on that dust cup, it fills up swiftly. I am still looking for an "elegant" solution on emptying it without swallowing too much dust. Long hair gets caught in the rotating brushes and has to be pulled out to keep them functioning. With one of my former vacs I just opened the lid and the brush slid out for cleaning, I wish this machine would come with the same feature.

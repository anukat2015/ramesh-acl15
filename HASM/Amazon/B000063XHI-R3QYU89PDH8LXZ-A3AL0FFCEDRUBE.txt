Title: We Love the Coffee!
Content:
After wasting $200 on 2 Cuisinart coffee pot's that didn't last long we researched this Capresso and based on the reviews bought one. It does make a great cup of coffee and that's the bottom line for us. We have had no problems with dripping, or warm coffee. Sometimes we have a cup late in the day and the coffee that's left over still takes good.
Yes, I agree with most that the Coffee Pot is pricey. In the long run I would have saved money if I had gotten the Capresso before I bought the Cuisinart's.

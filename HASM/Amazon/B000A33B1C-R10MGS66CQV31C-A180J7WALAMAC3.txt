Title: WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!
Content:
I purchased this unit after very extensive research of consumer reviews and news articles. What sparked my search for a heater was almost making the stupid mistake of purchasing a $400 EdenPure that my co-worker was going to buy. 80% of the reviews I read on the EdenPure were garbage!!
So... I purchased the Delonghi (which had stellar reviews) I think hands down, this may be the best purchase I ever made! If you are expecting a miracle heater that will allow you to shut your furnace off completely, there isn't one! I have had my delonghi running in my very open and large living room for 24 hours now, I have already turned my thermostat on the furnace down 3 degrees, and I am warm enough that I will probably turn it down even more!
My living room is very open and drafty. I no longer have the chill in my living room and also able to turn the furnace down! As with other reviews, I do agree the timer can be a bit noisy when it clicks on. When this unit is running, it is completely silent!
It does get hot to the touch if you hold your hand on it, but will not burn you if you just accidently run into it. I think for the Seventy bucks I spent on this was worth every penny! Especially when it outperforms a Four Hundred dollar Eden Pure!
I highly recommend this product, although I have not seen what it may do to the electric bill, but If I can make it so the furnace does not cycle on and off so much, it will probably be worth it!

Title: Good Laptop for the Money
Content:
Positives: Backlit keyboard, I do a lot when I am in the baby's room in the evening when he is sleeping so being able to see the keys is great. Having the full ten-key number pad is nice also. The compatibility of Windows 7 with my 3rd party software has been great so far... so much better than Vista.  Gaming is great and the Blu-Ray addition is nice when traveling or hooking it up to your TV at home.  The speed is great, loading is quick.
Negatives: Screen brightness is low.  If it is really bright out, it can be hard to see at times. Battery life is weak, but it usually is on most laptops I have seen. Heavy for a laptop, but that should be expected with the hardware you are purchasing.  Lack of USB ports is a turn off, 4 would have been much better 
Overall a great PC for the price. I would definitely recommend at the $1099 price tag. I have had the PC for a month now, we shall see how I like it in the long run.

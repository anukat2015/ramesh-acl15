Title: Nikon D80 verse D40
Content:
Coming from a prior point & Shoot camera owner to a nikon D80 was a big step for me.  I choose the D80 over the D40 because of the on camera photo editor that allows me to edit photos prior to uploading to web for local photo printing. The nikon d80 is several steps above entry level DSLR that gives me the ability to take shots that I just could not get from my point & Shoot camera and guess what it accomplished that and more with photos that are extremely detailed and color rich. In addition to the Nikon D80 body I choose the Nikon 18-200mm vr lens, Nikon SB800 flash (A must) and a 60mm micro lens.  In the future I will be purchasing a nikon 10-24mm wide angle lens.

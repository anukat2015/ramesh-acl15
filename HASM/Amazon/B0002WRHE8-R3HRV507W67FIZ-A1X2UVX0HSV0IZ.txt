The thing is well-made and has worked flawlessly for us (about a month). Lights instantly always, runs clean, and really puts out some warmth.  Not seeing any of the difficulties mentioned in other opinions.  This is the larger model, and we usually use the medium output rate to heat a leaky 600' garage on 49-degree nights.  It can eat a pair of propane canisters in a couple of nights, D batteries last longer for the fan. But the way to go for us has been a 5-gallon propane tank and the plug-in AC adapter to run the little fan.  Makes it way cheaper and more practical.  The 5 gals lasts about two weeks.  You can't really adapt to the fittings in the unit yourself, so buy the tank adapter/regulator, and the AC adapter with the unit.

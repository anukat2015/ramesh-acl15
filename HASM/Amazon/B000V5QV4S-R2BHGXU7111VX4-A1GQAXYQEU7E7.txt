Title: Great Camera, Solid Build
Content:
This camera surpassed my expectations and then some. Great speed and battery life. Damn near instantaneous start up times and lots of great features usefull to pro and semi-pro photographers. Make sure that whatever size CF card you get that its fast. I recommend the SanDisk 8 or 16 gig Extreme III. With this card I have basically zero lag between the card and camera. As quick as I can take the pics, this card is able to write them. Dont get any of Extreme IV SanDisk cards because you are just wasting your money , since the Canon 40d cant even handle the Extreme IV speeds. Rumors are saying the new version of this camera will be out at the beginning of the year , so if you can wait untill then do so, but if your like me and couldn't wait and needed this Camera right away then go for it. Great investment. 5 Stars NO DOUBT.

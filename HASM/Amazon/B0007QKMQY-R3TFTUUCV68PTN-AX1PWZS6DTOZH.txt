Title: Accessories for beginners and first timers
Content:
This is my first SLR camera and I'm very impressed how much it performs like a film camera rather than the delay that I've grown used to with normal digital cameras.  Just a quick skim over the manual and I was off on my way.  The power of this camera will come when I take the time to RTFM (Read the fine manual).  The two pictures that I took where the main subject was blurry were due to my not understanding how the camera works, but all of the items in the background were clear.  Pictures taken in a very dark room came out perfect.  I snapped 43 pictures yesterday and look forward to taking many more.
I purchased a lot of accessories with mine and purchased some more today due to not fully understanding all of the parts that I received.  I originally purchased the Canon EH-18L Semi-Hard Case.  This case is fine when you're out and about with the camera taking pictures, but does not hold anything other than the camera with lens.
Today I purchased the Canon Accessory Starter Kit for Digital Rebel XT (Includes 200DG Bag, NB-2LH Battery & 58mm Haze Filter) This way I can put my battery charger, the Canon BG-E3 Battery Grip, spare batteries and lenses all in the same place.

Title: A great laptop
Content:
I have been a PC user since I started to get into technology 18 years ago.  I never laid an eye on a Mac products until last year.  I have to admit that ever since the new iMac and Macbook Pro came out, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I had 2 Dell laptops, a 14" and a 12", which lasted me about 6 years total before and they were fine.  I never had a recent to purchase another laptop until last Black Friday sale from Amazon which turned out to be a great deal.  I pulled the trigger on this and I haven't had a regret since.  The design and the OS is easy to use.  The keyboard lit is a great feature at night time.  The screen on this is SUPERB and it sure beat most of the PC laptops out there.  The clarity is unbelievable.  I purchased an additional 2GB or RAm to max it out and upgraded to a 320GB 7200 RPM myself.  Both installation were easy and fast.  Instructions were available in the manual and on apple's website.  If you're still debating on getting this laptop, DON'T, JUST DO IT.  I assure you won't regret having this laptops compare to any other PC one out there.  Sure there are many that are cheaper and have more features but the quality of this is excellent and it's thin and did I mention GORGEOUS looking.

Title: Don't even want one for free.
Content:
A DC11 was offered to me gratis, so I gave it a whirl. I'd hoped the carpet head would work better than my Miele's, which is also air powered, but the Dyson just wouldn't pick up the stuff it was flicking up. The turbohead is see-through, so I could see small objects (a tiny piece of gravel, actually) spinning around and around. I kept having to turn the machine off because the button on the side of the turbohead that automatically switches for hard floor surfaces kept self-depressing and then the gravel would fall back down onto the carpet. 
Most of the dirt flung sideways, which the exhaust vent then blew all over the room. BTW, the machine vents a LOT of heat. The button that automatically switches for hard floor surfaces kept self-depressing, due to the aforementioned dirt collecting and clogging the screen on it. Pulling it out manually doesn't help. You have to clean the screen, which means detaching the wand.
Speaking of which, even after hearing audible clicks, the wand kept collapsing and pinching my hand. The suction is better with the wand collapsed, which makes it too short to use.
On hard floors, it did OK. I'd rather spend a small fortune on a new Miele than take the DC11 for free.

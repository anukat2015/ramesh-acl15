Title: Cozy, toasty, but poor build quality
Content:
We live in Chicago and decided to buy this heater to save some money on heating costs by turning off our central heat and using this unit.  For just the 2 of us in a 2 bedroom apartment, we move this unit from the living room, to the bedroom, and even the bathroom in the morning.
The problem is that the unit has "melted" after just 1 year of use.  It might have been due to our practice of creating a "heat tent"...we place the heater by our feet next to the sofa, and creat a "tent" over the heater with us in it...I think the blanket fell on he heater and it overheated.  The unit still works, but only on the medium mode...on hot, the overheat switch trips...also, the plastic and metal are deformed...at least we didn't set the apartment on fire!!!  It seems pretty safe otherwise with a very sensitive tip-off and overheat switch.
Before it malfunctioned, it did get us nice and warm, even through the bitter chicago winter last year.
Overall 3 stars: warm, compact, powerful, and stylish...but didn't last 1 year.

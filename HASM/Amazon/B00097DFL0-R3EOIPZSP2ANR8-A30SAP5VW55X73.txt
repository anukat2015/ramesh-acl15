Title: 2 Years and No Problems
Content:
I've had this Sunpentown portable AC for nearly 2 summers and so far I have no complaints. It has worked flawlessly. My family and I live in a 2nd floor apartment unit that bakes during summer days, and the walls radiate heat well into the night, so having an AC running in the bedroom at night is a must in order to sleep comfortably. Initially, we tried running it in our living room area (which includes the kitchen) during daytime hours, however this is just too small of a unit to be very affective in that large an area (again, where the walls radiate the suns heat). It took a little bit of the edge off, and if you are sitting immediately in front, it does feel good (like the AC in a vehicle). Alas, we keep it in the bedroom and turn it on in the late afternoon. By 9pm it's cooled comfortably.
Emptying out the water tank can be a little bit of a challenge since the spout is so low to the ground -- I usually use a shallow cookie tray or muffin tin (rinsed thoroughly afterards) to collect the water. But I seldom have to empty it -- once every month or so.
I actually appreciate the "noise" that the compressor makes when it's on -- white noise helps me sleep.
I feel quite confident in Sunpentown, and if I'm in the market for another AC, I'll look to them first.

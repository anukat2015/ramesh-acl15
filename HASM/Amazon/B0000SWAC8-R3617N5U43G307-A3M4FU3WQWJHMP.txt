Title: Satisfied Wife
Content:
My wife had purchased a Fantom Lightning Vac some 3 or 4 years ago and had nothing but trouble with it almost from the beginning but for sure after the warranty had expired. After searching the market and being disappointed with the quality of today's vacuums, She remarked that her old Electrolux lasted for more than 20 years and that she should just get another one. Well, we found it on Amazon.Com and read the reviews to which we agreed that some people just aren't mechanically inclined and disregarded the negatives. We purchased the model 6988A and once again, my wife is very pleased with her vacuuming machine. The quality is built in and the performance really satisfies her. Thanks, Electrolux, for building products that our loving spouses like. Well worth the monies.

Title: No manual to go with IPOD, can't use it without instructions
Content:
I am sure the IPOD Nano that I got for my husband for christmas will be awesome.  But considering there are no manuals on how to do anything with this IPOD we haven't been able to use it.  I was able to pull up a manual online but it is 80 pages and that doesn't include the manual for the features.  Imagine how horrible it is trying to go back and forth online to read how to work the IPOD.  I am very unhappy, never have I purchased an electronic product that it does not have a manual with it.  Right now I spent $139.00 for nothing as my husband is unable to use his IPOD.  I have hunted all over the amazon website to find out how to report it so that hopefully they will send me a manual but not a spot to report it either.  If it was sold by someone other than amazon I could report it.  This situation sucks all around, how horrible to get a gift you don't know how to use!

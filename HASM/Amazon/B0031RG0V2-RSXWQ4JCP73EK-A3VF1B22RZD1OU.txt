Title: The perfect laptop for travel
Content:
This took some hunting down on Amazon as it doesn't show up when you do any of the filters, ultra-portable: thin and light, that kind of thing.
The base spec I wanted was 11-12 inch screen, dual core processor, and under 3.5 pounds.  It came down to this, the Dell and the Toshiba.  The Dell seemed to have a problem with the 6 cell battery where it sticks out at the base.  The Tosh only came with 2gB memory.
This has a 500gb HD and 4gb memory, basically a full spec compared to whatever else is around.  The 6 cell battery fits the profile of the computer perfectly.  The keyboard is nice.  The screen is nice.  The mousepad is good once you get the hang of it, it's the same as every other laptop this size.  Best of all it weighs in at just over three pounds.  I just spent the last week lugging it around London and hardly knew it was in my bag.  Delighted with my purchase.  Highly recommended.

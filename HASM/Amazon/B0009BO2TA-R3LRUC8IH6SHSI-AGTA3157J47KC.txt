Title: The Hoover is OK
Content:
As stated by other customers the parts want to fall off while vacuuming
but I think it has pretty good suction for the small vac.  It also manuevers pretty good. So I will keep it.  It is a nice little vac for floors and rugs but I would not get it for large area carpeted floors.  No way, you need a big vac for that.  Invest in Dyson, or Electrolux.
Something like the big ones.

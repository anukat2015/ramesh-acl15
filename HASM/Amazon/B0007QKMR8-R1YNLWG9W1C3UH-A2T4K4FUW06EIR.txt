Title: I love my Rebel XT
Content:
I love my Rebel XT.  I have had it for 3 years.  It takes really good pictures, whether it is pictures of my family or nature photography.  Any problems I've had with photo quality have been due to user error. (I'm still learning the proper way to use all of the camera settings--it's taken me a while due to laziness, not difficulty.)
I like that the shutter speed is fast and that I can take multiple pictures in a row rather quickly.  
You should be aware that, as with all SLRs, if you purchase other lenses as we have that it does get dirty inside fairly easy.  When it gets dirty, I only see spots on sky shots, and they can be photoshopped out, but when they get really bad, you need to take it to a camera shop that specializes in cleaning digital SLRs.  There is a way to clean the CMOS (see manual), which sometimes helps with the problem.

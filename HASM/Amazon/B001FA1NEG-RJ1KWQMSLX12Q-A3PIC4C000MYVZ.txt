Title: First time I feel apple has a bad design
Content:
In an attempt to keep the product looking and feeling small, they have curved the case of the new nano.  This has resulted in a curved surface for the screen.  If there is a direct light source, it is hard to angle the unit in order to view the whole screen without glare.

Title: Good machine but Windows Vista only and REALLY DANGEROUS BIOS upgrade!
Content:
This is a very fine and fully loaded laptop.
I already had a previous HP pavillion dv-1030us model at home (which gave me no major problems for the last years) so I decided to stick to it.
I still did not have the chance to really use it because as soon as it arrived, I got a HP Health Check window with a list of recommended upgrades that should be applied. Pretty normal and expected since I was turning it on for the very first time, right?
Well, the 1st upgrade in the list was a BIOS upgrade, which I obviously downloaded and executed. The only problem was that the new HP Insyde BIOS flash utility for Windows Vista seems to be more of a threat than a utility. It simply popped-up a "Verify Error" message and completely frozen Windows and made the fan and HD run like crazy . Even the power button stopped working. The only way I was able to turn it off was by removing the battery. After that, the machine was completely dead! The power button didn't even light-up any of the machine's LED, not even the battery charging indicator.
I chatted with HP "support" just to know that I'd need to send the laptop for maintenance. So I decided to return it to Amazon for replacement and now I don't intend to apply any BIOS upgrades from HP any time soon.

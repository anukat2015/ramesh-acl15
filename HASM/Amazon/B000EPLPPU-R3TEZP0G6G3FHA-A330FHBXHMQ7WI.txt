Title: Not what I needed for podcasts
Content:
I listen to podcasts more than music.  I wanted an easy way to synch podcasts to listen to while I work out in the yard.  I can do this in a bunch of steps (plug in Shuffle, delete current contents on Shuffle, drag and drop all podcasts into shuffle, wait for half a gig to update), but really wish I could do this in no steps (plug in Shuffle, magically update podcasts).

Title: Super Heater!
Content:
The DeLonghi HHP1500 Mica Panel Radiator is well worth the money.  The first time use produced very little odor.  This unit provides great warmth to a fairly large cathedral ceiling room that includes kitchen, dining, and living room (21'x25') even on the low setting (ceiling fan used to mix air).  It is being used to supplement fuel oil hot water baseboard heat to keep oil usage down.  Once the cold weather sets in permanently we may have to make adjustments to the settings that are used to maintain a good balance between oil and electric.

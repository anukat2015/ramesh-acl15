Title: I'm sure I'd like it if not for the bugs in Itunes 7.x
Content:
Well, I've never bought an Ipod, having held off for years. With the lower price on the classics, I jumped in.
Boy am I sorry. I've had it a week, and can't do a thing with it. The itunes software is buggy and deleted all my songs (after getting them on their easily on an older version, which it made me update). Now,itunes tells me it can't write to my device and continually tells me to reset it (which does nothing). Look on apples support site and you see hundreds of people screeming in the forums about this problem, with no response from Apple anywhere... not even acceptance a problem exists and a 'we are working on it'.
These things are supposed to be easy to use... that is the main advantage of Ipod on itunes, right??? Well, I'm about ready to return this one. Buggy software and non responsive support is not the way to 'lead the industry'.

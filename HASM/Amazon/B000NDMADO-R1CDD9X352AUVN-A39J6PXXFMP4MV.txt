Title: This vacuum really sucks--literally!
Content:
I have to admit I was skeptical at first because of the lukewarm "professional" reviews of Dyson in general, but now I'm a true convert.  I LOVE this vacuum (coming from someone that HATES housecleaning).
Pros
--Canister style vacuum-great for those of us with back problems that can't push around a heavy upright for long.
--Suction power-WONDERFUL suction on this thing.    
--Power brushes-stiff bristles "refresh" the carpet and can easily be turned off by foot controls (no bending down).
--Maneuverability-this has a ball style joint that makes it extremely maneuverable.
--Compact storage-it wraps around itself and is light enough to easily pick up and carry.
--No filters or belts to replace-just clean the built-in filter every 6 months with tap water.
--Quiet!-this is the quietest vacuum I've ever used.
--Retractable cord-guess this is standard on most canisters, but as a former upright user this is a nice feature to me.
--Low profile vacuum head-makes it easier to get under the couches, beds, etc.
--No bags to buy...ever!
--5 Year Warranty
Cons
--No headlight-funny I didn't realize how dark some of my corners are.
--Using attachments is a little awkward because of the larger, inflexible handle, but I imagine I'll get used to it.
--Short power cord-could definitely use a few more feet, but I suspect this was as long as they could fit into the compact unit.
--Power brushes-just a warning here, they're not for delicate carpets.  They're rather stiff compared to most and I imagine could do some damage to older/thinner rugs.
--Small collection bin-available volume seems small due to the compact design, but it's EASY to empty, so not really a big problem.
--Price-it's not cheap, but I did find a 20% off coupon on-line for another store so saved $100.
There are enough cons that I can't give this vacuum 5 stars, but none of them are serious enough in my opinion to be major detractors.  I'm definitely happy with my purchase.

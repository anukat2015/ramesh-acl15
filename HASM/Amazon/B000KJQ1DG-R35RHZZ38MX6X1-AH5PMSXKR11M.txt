Title: It all comes together with this outstanding camera
Content:
I have been searching for a great camera.  I had Canon D30 and got a 350D (Rebel XT) and found it to be a very compelling camera.  One of the reasons I bought it over the Nikon was for the extra mega-pixels and it got good reviews.  I still like it but it's no longer my first choice and I may soon sell it because subjectively the Nikon's better.  I got a great deal on a Sony a100 and it's a terrific camera.  I've got tele lenses and in poor light it stabilizes the picture well enough to allow the shutter to stay open as long as it needs to properly expose the shot and there's no blur because of the anti-shake.  So for long distance it's a great choice.  It's a great camera and I'm keeping it because of its amazing capabilities.  But this Nikon D40 hit a sweet spot for me.  If I'm going to grab a camera to take a great shot, I grab the D40.  Inside and out it takes quick, sure fire great shots.  Light with great LCD and the best menu system with help even.  It's quick and the pictures are smooth and just gorgeous.  I go ahead and ask it for "vivid" color so I don't have to post process much and usually set the exposure to under expose a hair.  It's easier to lighten than to darken if you want proper detail.  Most of the shots require little or nothing.  If you are in the market for a high grade consumer camera or a walk around camera for a semi-pro this is a can't miss choice.  Just wait to see your pictures and baby you can drill down all you want to look for noise and its just not there.  This is one sweet camera.  Highly recommended...

Title: Mac is nearing the perfect laptop
Content:
Well, it's happening. The highly regarded Macbook Pro has finally reached the near-$1,000 mark.
There simply is no beating Mac's superior design and functionality, particularly the iLife software. Battery life isn't quite 7 hours, but it does hover nicely around 6.
One downside to the new Macbooks: they're prone to smudging. But if function, style and speed are more important than fingerprints, it's an easy call.

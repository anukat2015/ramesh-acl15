Title: Good enough
Content:
I bought this for my office, which is especially chilly in the wintertime. I'd live in the tropics if I could, and this heater is effective in making my office my own personal sub-equatorial haven. There seems to be a fan option as well, which will be nice in summertime.
I do with there was more control over the amount of heat put out. Sometimes it gets too hot, and I want to just turn down the temp but keep the fan going, and it shuts off. I probably just need to be more patient with the unit. 
For $20, you really can't go wrong.

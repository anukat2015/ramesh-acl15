Title: Apple Improves on a Great Product Once Again!
Content:
Easy and fun to use.  The video options and the FM radio were a bonus to me, I did not realize that was part of this 5th generation Nano iPod. I got the 8 gig model and probably should have got the 16 gig model as I have it 60% full after just 6 weeks.  Seeing the controls and settings when outside in daylight while using the video is very hard and learning how to start and stop the video took some getting use to. It captures good video and sound in close to medium distances, but not good for panoramic shots or close ups from a distance as there is no zoom.  
All in all, it is fun to have and use once you figure it all out.  By the way, I never read the instructions on line, so it's not that difficult to use. The standard headphones were usless to me. I purchased some sony in the ear headphones that work great and block out exterior noice and keep the music private.

Title: Good enough
Content:
Price is right. Heats up a 20x40x9 space in about 10 minutes. The chord does run a bit warm, but it's not a concern at this point. I bought two of these and the remotes work well. I'll take away one star because the unit only rotates 90 degrees; I expected 180 degree rotation.

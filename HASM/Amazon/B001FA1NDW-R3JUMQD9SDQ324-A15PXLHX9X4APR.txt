Title: iPod 16 gig 4th generation
Content:
Haven't had it too long but so far, so good.  A previous reviewer said the iPod would not charge in his boombox as others would.  I found that to be true.  Seems you have to charge it on the computer, but I'm sure there are other chargers available, I just haven't looked for them.  The 16 gig holds lots and lots of songs (which is what I wanted it for).  My previous 4 gig iPod was full and when I went to start the new 16 gig it synced all the previous iPod's tunes and then I could load my new ones.  I wanted the new one so I could load all my classical music on it (the previous 4 gig had only popular music).  Now I have a combination of both, which is good.  So far the 16 gig is only half full so I have lots of room for all the popular music I haven't put on it and maybe more classical.

Title: Unobtrusive, but expensive
Content:
We were hoping to use this to help warm our bedroom which is over a garage. Unfortunately, it's just not up to the task. It heats up about 2' in front of it but beyond that you wouldn't know it's on. Granted our space is larger than the 120 sqft but you would think you'd feel something.
I ended up using it in a small office and if I close the doors it does an adequate job of warming the room.
The instructions say to mount this on an inside wall. That was another surprise since the cold spots are near the outside walls. 
I doubt if I would purchase another unit.

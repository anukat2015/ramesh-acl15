Title: Excellent Machines! For 2 generations and counting...
Content:
I had purchased my very first Braun Tassimo machine back in Feb 2007. It was great until I upgraded to the Bosch unit in June 2009 and I couldn't be happier. I have used Tassimo almost every day since I got it and I am addicted to it. I love the coffee and cappuccino it makes. My wife loves the tea and the hot chocolate. The varieties are simply amazing. It is lighter and asks for very little cleaning and maintenance compared to the older unit. This one has saved me thousands of coffee shop dollars!

Title: Less than 5 hours operation and it's dead
Content:
Bought one of these in October. I liked the fact that it had a large heat transfer area, so it should give a nice wide heat cone.
That it did. 
What it didn't do was last. 
I plugged it in today, and the fan is apparently seized. It just hums, and after a few seconds begins to overheat.  
Judging by what I'm finding on the internet I won't have much, if any, success with Delonghi's "warranty." 
Rather disappointing, but at the same time, enlightening.

Title: Sizzle & Smoke
Content:
My one-one coffeemaker started sizzling, smelled like burned wire and stopped working after just a few months.  I sent it back and heard nothing. I called and they blamed the problem on the hard water we have in our area.  I've had other coffee makers that did not fail from mineral build-up in a matter of months.  They still won't tell me if/when they will ship me a replacement after having it over a month.  When it worked i loved it - i just wish it had been more reliable.

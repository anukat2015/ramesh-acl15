Title: My Feet Ar WARM In The Office!
Content:
My office is COLD! About 65 degrees standing at the thermostat, but I swear it is colder at my desk. This footrest does wonders for helping to work through the chill. Plug it in and turn on to the first setting. It takes several minutes to heat up to the full temperature. My feet are like icecubes and this footrest warms them right up. I only gave 4 stars because I wish there was an option for a lower setting. It actually gets REALLY warm to the point where it feels too hot for bare feet. Probably is awesome with socks =) If you leave your shoes on, it will also warm up the bottom of your shoes so they are cozy. Love it!

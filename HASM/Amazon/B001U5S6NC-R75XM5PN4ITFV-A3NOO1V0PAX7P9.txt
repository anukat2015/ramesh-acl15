Title: neat lil laptop for the price
Content:
had the laptop for 6 months now. Its beautiful. simple and does what i need it to do.. 
bad: it contains vista.
When i first got the laptop, it was shint. and blue.. and pretty.. :)
then i turn it on.. took over 15-20 mins to start up.. 
vista is a real chore. lots of 3rd party programs built in, that slows the machine down terribly!
but after working on it for a day or two.. removing everything and putting all that i need.. it works great.
even installed ubuntu as a 2nd OS on it.. and it works great! no compatibility issues with it as some others may have complained about on other forums. 
so if u havent got lots to spend.. and u need something on the go that reliable. this ACER can do... :)
oh.. and the battery lasts about 2hrs.. with average use.. running videos.. much less..  :)

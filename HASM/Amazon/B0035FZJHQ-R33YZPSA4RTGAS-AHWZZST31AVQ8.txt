Title: In love with this little camera!
Content:
I have been using this camera for almost a month now, I find it is very easy to use and the picture quality is far exceeding my expectation! The pros of this camera are like most other reviews mentioned, but there is one thing I don't know if it is my camera's problem or SD card's problem, when I shoot video clips the quality is good but they are jerking so badly, I have a brand new Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card, I know some people say Class 10 is better to shoot video, is anyone have the same experience. Since most people here have no problem with the video mode I think just mine that does it or maybe I need a better card?
Overall, I love this camera and I highly recommend it to people who are looking for their first DSLR, you gonna love it!

Title: Reliable laptop computer
Content:
I bought this product on Oct 24th,2009.
First of all I was glad it wasn't packed with much adware or promotional software as I feared.
I've got a 3 month MS Office trial period which was quite generous.
The speakers are pretty good for a laptop computer but if you want more you can hook up a set of speakers. For my choice I would prefer the plugging at the back or at one side instead of the front.
The LCD screen is great. The style and design is quite neat. I pulled it out of the case at LAX airport and some japanese fellows were quite amazed by the looks of my brand new computer.
The only setback, which does not bother me, is the absence of a blu ray player. If you can spare this feature you save over $250 over the very same model with blu ray included.
You can't go wrong with Sony I guess. One friend put it in these terms: a Sony VAIO is like a BMW or Mercedes Benz in the laptop world.

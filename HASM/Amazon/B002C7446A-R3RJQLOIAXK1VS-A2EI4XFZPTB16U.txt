If you're thinking of making the jump from PC to Mac, do it!  This is an awesome machine.  Lighting fast web browsing and quick to respond all around... startup, shutdown, program launching, plugging in USB hardware, etc.  You start an action and you're there.  I timed how long it took to do a re-start... 40 seconds (that's to shut down and reboot, ready to go!!)  And then there's the beauty of the beast.  A work of art. Sleek and silent. Light and sturdy. Gorgeous screen, beautiful backlit chiclet keys, smooth and silky trackpad action.  Plus ridiculously long battery life and quality power cord system with magnetic connection.  For me it was like trading in a Ford for a Lexus, or that feeling you had when you went from dial-up to high-speed.  If you're not already a Mac user it'll take a bit of time to get comfy with the different operating system and key functions, but it's well worth the effort.  I've had mine since the Monday before Christmas and we've settled in quite nicely.  I've had to boot up my old HP Pavilion notebook a few times to access some things I had left behind on it.  I had forgotten what a revolving hourglass looked like.  I felt like kicking it across the living room...LOL.   WooHoo!!!

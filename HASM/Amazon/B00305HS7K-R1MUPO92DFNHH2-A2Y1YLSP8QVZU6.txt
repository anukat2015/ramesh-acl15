Title: Second Qosmio for me
Content:
Have owned the Qosmio G25 for nearly 5 years and never had any problems.  It still works great, but when I tried the latest EA Battlefield game it was unable to play it.
So, as a previous owner happy with his purchase I had only to read a few positive reviews before buying the X505-Q880.  I'm very pleased.  The biggest drawback with Toshiba, in my opinion, is the customer support web page.

Title: lousy product
Content:
This coffee maker does not stand up to the cuisinart reputation. The coffee tastes terrible, does not stay hot as promised but most of all, it's a pain to use. If the filter holder is not exactly in the correct spot, the water will spill over, dripping coffee grounds and water all over the place. If the carafe is not exactly in the right spot, the same thing. When you try and pour the coffee out of the carafe, you have to actually turn it upside down. Hate it, never buy another cuisinart coffee maker.

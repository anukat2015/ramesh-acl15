Title: MP3 Player not for the Light of Heart
Content:
The Creative Zen is at heart a good player, but proves to be initially frustrating.  Getting your music library, playlists, and videos on it was difficult.  It you use Itunes for your music, stick to apple because you will not be able to move itunes movies or videos onto the player.  I bought this player as an upgrade since it is able to play video, unlike my previous one.  This is something this player doesn't do well.  If you expect to get legal movies and shows onto it, you will be disappointed.  Buy this player if you want good music quality, and the occasional video.  Make sure the resolution is the same or smaller than the zen otherwise you will not be able to put it on.  I reccommend this product as a cheap player used primarily for music, and maybe in the future movie and video copyright laws will loosen up , as music has, and the zen will rise up and prove to be a good purchase, otherwise, I recommend trying a different brand.  If you are not computer savvy DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, a good bit of computer experiance, or someone in your house must have computer skills to make this player usable.  Don't shun this player, but don't buy it inless you need a cheap player with decent options.

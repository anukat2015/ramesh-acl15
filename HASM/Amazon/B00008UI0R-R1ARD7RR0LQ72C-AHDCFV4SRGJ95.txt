Title: Total POS
Content:
Ordered it on March 1. As of April 11, it's hot working. Smells like smoke when it is run. When I took off the filter to investigate, I see sparks shooting out of the sides. No suction. What's best is that Hoovers website is down so I can't contact them to find out what's wrong.

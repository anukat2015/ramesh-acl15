Title: Good for music, bad for audio books
Content:
This is a very decent music or other short audio segment player with a very nice screen.  This is a great device for taking to the gym while exercising .
There are really only two shortcomings on this device:
1. The fast-forward/reverse buttons are too small and it's very easy to skip to the next/previous track rather than scan through a song.
2. This is not a friendly device for listening to audio books.
To expand on the problem with audio books a bit.  There are a few problems in this area:
1. The device is not compatible with audio books from Audible so if that is your favorite audiobook site you should look for another player.
2. The player has no support for bookmarking your location in the book so you have to make sure you leave the player paused when your done listening and make sure you don't do anything to change the screen (i.e. going to the menu or try to use any other feature)
3. The fast-forward/scanning features only increment in about 5 second blocks.  Thus it recently took me a couple hours to get back to my place in my audio book (about 6 hours in) due to having to hold the tiny fast-forward button and a couple times of my finger slipping and skipping to the next track (and thus having to start all over)

Title: For the next 5 minutes, at least, the best "consumer" dslr out there.

I came to the d300 by way of a d70. Wow. That is like going from a Honda Civic (my car, actually) to a Mercedes. Everything about it is in a new class. The 14-bit a/d converter results in more nuanced colors (although this is not a radical change). The meter is the best I've used in 40 years of hobby photography. The controls, once I got used to them, are perfectly intuitive. Build quality is fantastic. The manual, though 421 pages long (!), is well written and easy to use. My d300 came with Nikon CaptureNX, which has a few annoying interface features, but works quite well. Best levels/curves function I've used (much better than Adobe's). What fun to own a toy like this!

Title: Just what we need
Content:
Delivery was very expedient and the item arrived well packaged. This was certainly an very reasonably priced item considering that is it stainless steel and not plastic. We live in hot and humid South FL and an A/C is quite essential to have. This unit comes with a full set of accessories which was a plus as I had purchased an one several years ago that did not. It is quite nicely designed and the stainless steel looks great compared to those with the standard cream colored plastic housing.  I setup the a/c in our master bedroom which is approximatley 200 sqft large. Setup was quite simple and even someone as technically incompetent as myself was able to get it all done in less that 15 mins.  Turned it on and could immediately feel to cool air. I left the room and returned about 20 mins later and could feel that it was significantly cooler than before.  The temperature in the room was probably around 80 before I turned it on and it felt like a comfortable 70 when I returned. We've been using it quite often for almost a week now, and I am very pleased with the performance and reliability. I may get one for my son in the near future.

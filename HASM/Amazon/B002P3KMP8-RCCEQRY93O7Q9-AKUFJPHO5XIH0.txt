Title: ASUS - A SUESS? SURE!!
Content:
THIS LAPTOP IS GIANT. ITS REALLY BIG AND REALLY CRAZY!! ITS PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF A NETBOOK I WOULD SAY. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAS A FULL SIZE NUMERICAL KEYBOARD THAT I NEVER USE, BUT I REALLY LIKE TO LOOK AT IT AND KNOW I HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IF I WANT. I DO HAVE TO COMPLAIN THOUGH, AFTER ABOUT A WEEK OF HAVING THIS I GOT A VIRUS FROM DOWNLOADING A PROGRAM TO MAKE ME INTO AN AVATAR CHARACTER. NOT SURE IF ITS ASUS'S FAULT BUT THEIR COLORS SEEM LIKE NA'VI SO I BET IT PROBABLY IS!!
JUST A WARNING !

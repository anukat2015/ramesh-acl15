Title: This is the evil Mr. Coffee.
Content:
We can't return it or we would in a heartbeat.  Our kids gave it to my wife and me for our anniversary. We are stuck with it until it has an unfortunate accident and breaks into a million ugly pieces.
You can grow coffee faster than it brews a pot.  Somehow it loses a cup of water in the process and then, when you finally get a pot brewed the spout on the carafe is designed so poorly, that unless you pour it a dribble at a time, it spills out past both sides of the miserable little lip - hot/lukewarm coffee all over the place first thing in the morning!!!
Getting water into the reservoir is easy, but the reservoir will not stand up straight on its own.  If you set it down in the sink, it tips over.
Whoever at Mr. Coffee designed and approved this piece of garbage should find themselves applying for unemployment, if they haven't already.
DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER.

Title: Eastern Washington state Heater review
Content:
I ordered this heater. Recieved it in two days on regular mail/ups. The heater heated my garage up in a half an hour to 60 degrees. from a cold 45 degrees. My garage is insulated , except for the roll up door leaks air at the top. I have a two car garage. It is  a place for me to repair things ,and do my projects in a warm place. Our temp. here have been getting into the single digits. Great heater. Nice looking, and easy to install. I would buy this heater ,and would refer it to anyone.Great to deal with this supplier.Wenatchee, Wa. cold country

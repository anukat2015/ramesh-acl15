Title: Almost Perfect
Content:
Apple sure has come a long way from the all-plastic PowerBook G3 to the first all-metal Titanium PowerBook G4 and now a mono-block Aluminum series of laptops known as the MacBook Pro.
After my PowerMac G4 desktop failed on me, I was left with a lonely Cinema Display. I transitioned from video editing to photo editing and figured I didn't need as much processing power as before. After much fiddling with the various MacBook Pro sizes, I settled for a MacBook Pro 13 (2.53GHz) because it has the extreme portability requirement, but with the same processing power and features as the basic MacBook Pro 15.
If I'm home, I connect the bigger Apple Cinema Display for dual monitor power use. On the road, I have a light and powerful laptop that doesn't take up much bulk.
Features / PROS:
- Dual monitor support up to 24" (If you have the older Apple LCD Cinema Display 23" as I do, you will need the optional Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter Model# MB570Z/A). Otherwise, the latest Apple LED Cinema Display 24" will plug right in.
- 2 x USB ports
- 1x FireWire 800 port
- 1 x Gigabit LAN
- SD card slot
- Battery level
- Multi-purpose Audio In / Audio Out jack. Unlike it bigger brothers, you only have one slot which generally wouldn't be a problem because not many users feed analog audio in signal these days and would rather opt for USB digital audio.
- IR remote to support Apple Remote
- Bright LED screen that does not need warming up
- Aluminum monobloc build gives it more strength and is a good insulator for better heat dissipation
- Glossy screen for prettier-looking videos
- Elegant back-lit keyboard with adjustable brightness that puts even Apple's own Aluminum desktop keyboard to shame
- Multi-touch trackpad that can virtually replace the need for a mouse
- WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n support
CONS:
- Glossy screen (Too pretty and too much glare. Not my liking.)
- Hidden stereo speakers produce a tinny sound with no perceivable stereo separation
- Non-user replaceable battery (I don't get how Apple can design and have the resource for a monobloc case, but cannot come up with an easy to replace battery. Most likely a marketing gimmick to either facilitate faster notebook replacement or generate more income for the Apple Retail store with after-service replacement cost. I'm just saying, it's perplexing.)
- Not-for-the faint-of-heart method to replace/upgrade hard drive and memory
- A 14" screen would have been more perfect for screen real estate and portability (and just leave the 13" screen for the MacBook)
- It really is expensive compared to Windows laptop counterparts
IS THIS FOR YOU?
- YES if you have excellent vision and can tolerate a 13" screen as your main viewing method OR if you have a larger display as your second or dual-monitor source
- YES for processing power as the larger MacBook Pro models without the bulkiness
-NO if you plan to use only one screen as you will run out of space quickly. I would recommend a MacBook Pro 15 in this case.
I would advise to thoroughly test it out at your nearest Apple Store / Dealer and try all laptop models until you find one that you can comfortably sink into in terms of use and budget.

Title: Awesome Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
Our Fanthom vacuum cleaner was only a year and a half old when the pet hair from our three cats and one dog sent it to the repair shop. No drive belt could be found so I bought a Bissell Pet Hair Eraser on the recommendation of a good friend. It was simple to put together and I tried it out on a 4 x 6 area rug. I am blown away by the dirt and pet hair it pulled off and out of the carpet!! Actually more like embarassed! We clean once or twice a week but this machine left the carpet looking almost brand new! It's easy to use, has great attachments and doesn't kick the kitty litter around. I love the pet hair bar that actually works! Finally a vacuum that really takes care of pet hair and dirt all at once!

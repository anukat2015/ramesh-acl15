Title: wonderful little heater
Content:
This little heater was everything I was looking for.  It travels with me in my house (we have oil heat and we are avoiding turning it on) and it heats up almost every place.  Its a little loud for the bedroom at night, but it usually shuts off within 20 minutes or so after its reached its desired temperature.  I think its a pretty good product for only $20.

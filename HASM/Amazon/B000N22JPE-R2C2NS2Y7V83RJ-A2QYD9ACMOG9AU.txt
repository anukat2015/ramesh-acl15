Title: Better than some of the reviews
Content:
I feel this is a really good coffee maker, especially compared to the one I previously owned. My only negative is that the water resevoir is in the back and quite small. It makes a great cup of coffee, doesn't allow grounds through the cone filter, and has all of the features that I like.

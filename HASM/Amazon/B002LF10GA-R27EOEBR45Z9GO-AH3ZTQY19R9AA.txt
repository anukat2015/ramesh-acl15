Title: You must consider this netbook!!!
Content:
I went to a netbook for several reasons, I have a big sreen laptop for work that is a pain to carry and with most of the sites being off limits Amazon included I had to get something smaller. First there was a Asus 900, then a 1000,H,HE and now a 1410. The difference in keyboard size is really nice with my big hands. The processor speed is as good or better than the reviews shown here. The size is about the same as the 1000 series with a much improved screen. The difference in screen quality is unreal. Out of the 4 Asus that I have bought 3 have gone back for repair. No issues with turn around but still. I have been having issues with my desktop and this unit is the 1st that I would consider to be my main personal computer. 
The only drawback right now is the top is a magnetic for finger prints, as soon as someone makes a plastic skin I will get and solve that issue.
I looked for several weeks to find a larger screen than the 1000HE and a little more speed, you can not find anything better at this time...

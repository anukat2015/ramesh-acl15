Title: A Good Coffee Maker
Content:
I recently purchased this product.  I got a good deal due to it being a demo in a Starbuck store.  It had been used for coffee samples and needed cleaning.  After that, it has served me well.  The coffee it makes is great!  As long as you follow the directions and align the arrows on the lid there's no drip.  Also, the directions highly emphasize proper placement of the carafe into its basket; I've had no overflow by following these instructions.  I also discovered that you can order the water filters from Delonghi by dialing 866-528-8323.  They are selling them for $1.50 apiece.  My only real complaint about this machine is its brewing temperature.  I would prefer it a bit hotter;  after adding creamer it really isn't warm enough.

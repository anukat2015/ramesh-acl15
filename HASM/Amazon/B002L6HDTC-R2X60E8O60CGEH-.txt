Title: ipod nano is awesome, but...
Content:
I bought this nano for my wife, and she is really happy with it; however, there is one major flaw with this 5th gen nano: it's not compatible with our ipod playing devices such as an fm transmitter with docking station and a house docking station/speaker system.  Turns out others have encountered this problem as well.  Of course, we can still use these devices to play music from the nano by using the alternate mini-jack input, but it's more cumbersome and doesn't take advantage of the charging feature of the docks.  Very disappointing!  I hear the previous gen nano didn't have this problem, so find an older model.

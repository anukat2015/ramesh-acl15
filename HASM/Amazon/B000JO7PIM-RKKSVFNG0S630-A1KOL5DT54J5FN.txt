Title: great replacement
Content:
I have a 30gb video and I used it all the time. I would have to charge it every 3-4 days. I loved everything about it except that it was so BULKY. Then, I won this ipod in a contest and I absolutely love it. Now it gets all the use that my video used to get. The audio chip was recently changed in the nanos so it sounds a lot better than the video or either of the previous nanos. The video quality isn't the greatest; I still use my other ipod for that, but everything else is better.

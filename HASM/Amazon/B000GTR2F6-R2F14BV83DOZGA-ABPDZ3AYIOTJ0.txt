Title: Couldn't leave the store without being complemented on the Keurig B70 in my basket...
Content:
I got my Keurig B70 using a 20% off coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond which was a nice deal.  Along with the machine, I picked up the carousel which holds 27 k-cups, and a 60 k-cup variety pack.  I figured that 60 k-cup variety pack along with the 18 samplers inside the box would allow me to have a bit of fun for a while.
One thing that really caught my attention was that as I was putting these items into my basket, I was stopped by someone who started telling me all about how amazing this machine was, and that he recently upgraded from the mini to the B70.  He assured me i'd love it and even gave me a bit of recommendations on some flavors to try (Coffee People Donut Shop, and Timothy's German Chocolate Cake).  
After a few minutes the guy walked off, and as i was making my way around the corner, another person look in my basket and told me I made an excellent choice.  Never in my life have I experienced such a response from other shoppers regarding what I had in my shopping basket.  This was pretty exciting because I knew I had made the right choice.  I was looking at the Senseo and Tassimo a few days earlier, but the reviews here on Amazon for the Keurig B70 along with the fact that there are just SO MANY k-cups to choose from made the decision easy for me.
After having my machine for about a week, I can say that I am extremely pleased.  The k-cups taste great, and the variety is amazing.  I can't believe how fast this thing can brew a cup.  It literally takes less than 2 minutes.  Because of this B70 machine I've been inspired to learn how to make cappuccinos, and how to froth milk.

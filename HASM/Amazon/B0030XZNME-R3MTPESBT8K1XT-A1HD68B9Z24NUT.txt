Title: Love it!
Content:
I did a lot of laptop researching before I bought this computer. My main purposes are for school work (I take online classes) and editing photography. I have found that for my needs this computer has done very well. However, I have never used the webcam or microphone. The disk burner works fine and the keys seem to be pretty sturdy. I have had this computer for a few months now and has yet to fail me, it runs very smoothly. I love it.

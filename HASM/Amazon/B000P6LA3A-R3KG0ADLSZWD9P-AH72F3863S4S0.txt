Title: VERY IMPRESSED!
Content:
After reading all the lukewarm reviews and never seeing anyone actually wearing a Jet Stream in real life, I dragged my heels on getting one for myself. I thought 'This can't be the ONLY sporty wireless MP3 player" out there... 
6 months went by and it remains the ONLY sporty wireless MP3 player, so I decided to take a chance and get one.
WOW! This thing is not only cool, but it looks like the programming has been upgraded since the last review on here.
1. It's Mac compatible, even though it doesn't say so on the box. I plugged the player into my macbook just to charge it up through the USB and lo-and-behold, it showed the drive, so I tried loading up songs and it totally worked!
2. The wireless headphones light up orange when they're charging so you know that you've connected them to their USB charger properly.
3. I can walk about 20 feet away from the player and the wireless headphones still pick up a signal.
4. You can skip back and forth within songs if you hold down the forward and back buttons. From other reviews, it sounded like people could only skip forward or back entire songs or podcasts.
Yes, the wireless headphones are a bit big to sit in my ears, but this is Way way way better than working out with regular headphones and having the cable bounce around and get all tangled up.
Very cool!

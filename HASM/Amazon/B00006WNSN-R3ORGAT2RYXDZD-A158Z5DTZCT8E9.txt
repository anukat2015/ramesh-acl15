Title: We love our coffee maker!
Content:
We got this coffee maker to replace our thirty year old 20 cup maker. After 2 months of constant use, it's still going strong. Unlike most people, we use this as our main coffee maker. It take us about 2 days to empty it. My husband fills his thermos when going to work and I still have coffee left over for the day.
 The coffee maker makes a decent cup of coffee. Our only problem was we had 4 large cans of coffee in the cupboard that we could no longer use. We wound up wrapping them for Christmas presents. This coffee maker uses a courser ground coffee than the ADC makers. Luckily our grocery store has whole beans that you can grind to your specs.
 My husband says he only wishes that it would come with a timer. I mentioned to him that this is normally used at a social function. We solved the problem with a timer that plugs into the outlet that we plug the maker into.
 Eventually when this one goes out, we'll buy another one like this. The size and style fits well on our counter under the cupboard. It takes about 40-45 mins for a full pot to brew.

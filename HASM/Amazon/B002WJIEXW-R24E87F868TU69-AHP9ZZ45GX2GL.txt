Title: Nice little unit.
Content:
Does exactly what it is designed to do.  Small, lightweight and functional.  If it had optional ac power (which I knew it didn't have) I would give it 5 stars.  Kracklebox is twice the price, doesn't sound as good (much more repetitive) but does have ac power.  But I like this one better.

Title: Only for diehard Leica-brand fans
Content:
After using & loving my Leica Digilux 1 for years, the Digilux 3 seemed like the perfect step-up to the DSLR world.  The lens is fantastic & has been winning rave reviews, & I'm a big fan of the camera's analog controls & the retro body styling.  After a week of using the Digilux 3 extensively while travelling, I'm extremely happy with my choice; the image stabilization, the bounce flash, the aperture ring on the lens, & the Live Preview LCD are all excellent features.  But buyer beware: There's basically no way to justify getting the D3 over its Panasonic twin, the DMC-L1, which Costco was selling for literally half the price of the D3 during this X-Mas holiday.  Despite the excellent lens, the L1 is about the right price for this camera, which makes the D3 a plain rip-off; almost any camera pro would tell you your money would be better spent on a Nikon D200 or Canon 30D, w/ hundreds to spare on lenses.  Despite this, I've managed to justify the extra cost of the D3 on strictly emotional/nostalgic terms - for everything that the Leica brand evokes & for how aesthetically pleasing the D3 is.  But I'll be the first to admit that these aren't very compelling reasons, & would point most other buyers to the L1 instead.

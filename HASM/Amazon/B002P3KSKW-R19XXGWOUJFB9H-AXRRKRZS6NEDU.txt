Title: great notebook
Content:
The only thing wrong with this machine is trying to get answers about it from ACER but guess that is the age we live in now.
Really like the finish as it does not show finger prints but it is not aluminum as described but possibly an aluminum type
paint, never the less it is a very nice finish.The audio is really good considering the size of the speakers.
I'm very happy with with this purchase and with AMAZONS service...
PS: Acer finally answered all my questions to my satisfaction so now all I can find wrong with this machine is it doesn't
have a cap lock light, no big deal!!

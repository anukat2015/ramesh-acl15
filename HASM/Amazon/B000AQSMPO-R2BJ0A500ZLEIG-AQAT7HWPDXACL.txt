Title: The perfect way to brew a single cup
Content:
Short and sweet: this is the absolute best way to brew coffee one cup at a time, hands down.  The variety of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available for the Keurig is mind-boggling.  Something for everybody.  But on the off chance nothing suits your taste, you can purchase (about $15) a reusable filter to make your own brew.

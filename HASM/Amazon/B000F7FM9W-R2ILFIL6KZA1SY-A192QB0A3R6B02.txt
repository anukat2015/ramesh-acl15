Title: You Will Get One Venti Out of This
Content:
To settle the "4 cups" debate - this coffeemaker brews 20 ounces max, which divides out to 5 ounce "cups" of coffee.  I'm guessing by this that coffeemakers got left out of the "super size" American evolution.  However to put it in perspective, 20 ounces is comparable to what you would get in ONE commercial coffeehouse coffee (if they fill it up to the very top of the paper cup - ever notice that?).  Anyhoo, this coffeemaker is perfect for someone like me who likes to fill up a travel mug in the morning and leave for work.

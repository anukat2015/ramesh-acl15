Content:
I purchased the Zune for my wife to use for audio books.  The setup was easy enough but trying to get items to the playlist doesn't work all the time.  The unit we received from Amazon was deliverd promptly as promised, but after spending 2 hours setting up the Zune and downloading items to it we found that the plug for the earphones was defective.  I notifyed Amazon and they promptly sent another unit.  However after setting up the unit and downloading we descoverd the unit was also defective.  Amazon stated they would refund our money since there was a problem with the units we received.

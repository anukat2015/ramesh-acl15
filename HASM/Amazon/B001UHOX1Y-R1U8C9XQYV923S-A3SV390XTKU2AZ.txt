Title: fabulous laptop
Content:
Just bought this laptop at staples after returning a sorry excuse for a laptop a 10.1 inch dell inspirion laptop. This laptop looks awesome, is fast and does everything one would want in a lightweight, stylish package.
You can buy it at staples for $599. 
I have been using this machine for over a week now and I see no problems with it. The battery gets no hotter than any other laptop

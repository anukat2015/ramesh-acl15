Title: Hoover S3670 WTAE canister needs a stronger hose!
Content:
The only reason for a less than perfect review is the hose--it kinks easily when pulled, especially in a change of direction, the hose will sometimes crimp together like one does a garden hose to stop the water.  Not good...this hose will likely develop a hole entirely too soon given this weakness.  If this were a car, a recall on the hose would be in order--Hoover really should consider developing a stronger, more durable hose that doesn't crimp and issue one to all those who purchased this vacuum.  The extra wide floor brush is excellent on the hardwood floors.  The little plastic wheels inside it made it travel squirrelly like a grocery cart with wheels needing alignment, but I popped those out and voila!  The best floor brush I've ever used!

Title: I love my iPOD
Content:
I've never owned an mp3 of any kind before so I can't make any comparisons but I will say that I find the iPOD nano (4th generation) to be easy to use, I love it's small size, and it produces a great sound.  The listening device that comes with it sits in the ear rather loosely but I can deal with that till I can get better ones.  Also, I found it on Amazon for nearly ten dollars less than any stores I shopped in, including Wal-Mart.

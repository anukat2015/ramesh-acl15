Title: iBook gets my highest praise
Content:
I purchased the iBook at the start of July and am extremely pleased with the features for the price.  I have been an Apple user since 1984.  My last laptop was the G3 series &quot;Wallstreet.&quot;  I have always been hesitant about purchasing one of the cheaper Apple products (iBook versus G4 Titanium) due to limited features .  Not so with this!  Very pleased that the iBook allows me to watch DVDs when flying and when I arrive at my destination and must send graphic (photographic) images, it still has those capabilities.

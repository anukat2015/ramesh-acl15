Title: IT SUCKS!!!!
Content:
Purchased this product Nov 2009.  The carafe has a design flaw and spills coffee all over the counter while pouring, but that's not the complete problem.  Within a few weeks, it would stop brewing in the middle of a pot of coffee and the ON OFF button seemed to work intermittently.  I cleaned it with vinegar water, as recommended.  That didn't help.  Finally, the ON OFF button stopped working completely.  It's in the pushed in position, so the unit can't be turned on anymore, and within a few months of owning this product, it's shot.  We made coffee once a day.  Never abused it.  Never immersed it.  Shame on you, Sunbeam, for selling such crap.  You used to have a good reputation.  AVOID buying this, Folks.  You'll be disappointed.  Spend your money elsewhere.

Title: THE BEST
Content:
There I am, in July, looking at my Cuisinart Coffee Maker that I just screwed up. Another appliance out in the unending pile in my garage. So, just as a lark and an exercise in masochism, I e-mailed them.  For some reason, I left my work number as a contact. I don't work summers. Obviously, I don't hear anything; what the hell, what do you expect from most, if not all, companies...comes November and a secretary at works mentions that a Cuisinart Rep. was trying to get a hold of me.... in July.
What the hell, I called them and the rep says; "put the coffee maker in a box and put it out on your front porch." So I get jumpy, and ask her; "why is this some signal that will target me for a corporate hit?"  She laughs, and gives me a number to put on the box. There are three eights in the number so it can't be all bad. I do it!
Get this, the next day the box is gone and two days later a brand new coffee maker is sitting there....yea, on my porch!  So I slap myself cause this has to be a dream...but it ain't.
I buy only Cuisinart...

Title: not your mom's electolux
Content:
This is vacuum is pure junk.  After only 5 months of light use the attachment to the motorized brush just fell apart.  This is a common problem with this vacuum. There is no quality here that you would expect from Electrolux.  Research reveals that it is made by Eureka. The use of the Electrolux name is just pure deception to capitalize on the Electrolux name.  When I took the vacuum in for repair you should see all the Electrolux Oxygen models lined up for repairs.  Take a look at [...] for similar complaints  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.

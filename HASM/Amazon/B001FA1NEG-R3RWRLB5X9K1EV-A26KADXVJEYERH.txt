Title: iTunes poor credit card security and Apple bad service
Content:
Nano is a neat device, but my experience so far with Apple has been horrible. I tried to download five songs via iTunes, and my credit card number was swiped immediately. In 12 years of online shopping, I've been careful and never had a problem. Apple customer service just tells you that it's your problem. They don't care if they have a security breach. Also, I found out that in order to replace the battery, you have to send the unit back to Apple, and there's a $60+ charge. I'll definitely not buy anything from iTunes again, and hopefully, not Apple.

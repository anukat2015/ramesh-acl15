Title: I love it!
Content:
Just got my first Dyson canister and I love it!  I vacuumed my entire home in less time and with less backache than ever before.  I was amazed with the amount of dust/dirt/pet hair it picked up.  The canister is also very easy to empty...no longer the chore it was with my old vacuum.  The cord is a little short, but I love the fact it retracts.

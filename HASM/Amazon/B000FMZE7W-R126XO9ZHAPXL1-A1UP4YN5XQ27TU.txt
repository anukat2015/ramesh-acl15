Title: no thanks.
Content:
While it looks relatively sleek, the Zune is 60% larger and 17% heavier than a comparable iPod.  That's moving backwards, not forwards.  Picking up speed in reverse, we have Zune's music store.  Songs cost 79 "points" which cost 99 cents but which can only be bought in 5 dollar blocks which just begs the question... how can I trust a pricing scheme that goes to such unneccessary lengths to manipulate my wallet?  Ultimately I can't. So...thanks Microsoft, but no thanks.

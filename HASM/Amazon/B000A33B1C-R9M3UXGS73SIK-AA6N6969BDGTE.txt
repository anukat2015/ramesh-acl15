Title: So good, I ordered another
Content:
I purchased one of these to help heat our drafty living area.  When I first turned it on, I thought I would have to send it back.  It just didn't seem to be putting out heat.  We moved it to the coldest part of the room and let it run about an hour.  Wow, what a difference.  Don't expect instant heat like the fan heaters.  It doesn't work like that. 
I ordered another for our bedroom and let it run for about an hour before we went to bed.  I actually got hot!  If you don't mind waiting a while for the room to get warm this is a great heater.

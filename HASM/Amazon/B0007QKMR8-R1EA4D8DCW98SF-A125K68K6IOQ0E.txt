Title: excellent value
Content:
excellent value for price.  Clear sharp images, good color.  the camera is easy to use with a short learning curve.  It is small and light.  there is a wide variety of lenses available both from canon and third party vendors.  the only drawback is the view finder which should be extended slightly further from the body of the camera.

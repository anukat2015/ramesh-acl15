Title: Good buy for the money!
Content:
The connector to the line you wear around your neck broke almost immediately but the earbuds and player work great.  I was able to rig up something so I could still wear it because that's what I wanted it for, to wear while I jogged.  Anyway, for the money it's a great deal just be ready to improvise.

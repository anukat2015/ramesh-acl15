Title: MELT DOWN
Content:
I am very happy with the player, it is super in terms of sound and battery life however there are some serious design issues. The LCD portion has shown some damage (I am guessing due to my body heat- holding it in my palms, putting it in pocket close to my body etc.) the inside looks melted!!. It hasn't affected the performance in any way, but the disfiguration decreases its aesthetic value. The disfiguration actually hasn't even stopped yet- it seems to get worse! Also, this is VERY stupid, but the display is useless under bright daylight condition. SONY needs to re-design! I expected better from 'em. Buyers beware!

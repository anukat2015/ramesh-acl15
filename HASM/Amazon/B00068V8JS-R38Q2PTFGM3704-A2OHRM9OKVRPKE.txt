Title: SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY A DeLONGHI!!!
Content:
I bought this item, because it's design and description sounded like a good thing.  I received it, set it up, and read the directions.  THE VERY VAGUE, and poorly written directions. In the product sales description (on line), it said there is an adjustable thermostat.  THERE IS NOT ONE AT ALL!  There is an INTERNAL thermostat that sets itself whenever it decides to turn ITSELF on or off.  There is NO temperature read out, there is no control for you, the operator to set and tell it to continue on until the room reaches this temp.  One of the features that attracted me was that there are two wattage settings...1500W or 900W.  I thought, this would be great, when the room gets warm enough, I can lower the wattage setting, and save on electricity costs.  AGAIN, YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE WATTAGE SETTING.  IT'S ALL INTERNAL...the MACHINE does it when it wants to!  I will type the description right out of their manual... "Economic Energy Saving Function (ECO)-When the room temperature reaches a certain point, the ECO green light will switch on, indicating that one-third of the power has been cut-off automatically to save energy."  Problem is...IT NEVER STAYS AT FULL WATTAGE...within 5 minutes of giving off heat at a full 1500 watts, it will switch to the lower wattage...NO MATTER WHAT TEMP THE ROOM IS.  I have Econo-Heat Flat Panel Wall Heaters in my living room (check them out THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!), and when we have these cold, cold nights, my living room goes down to below 60 at night.  I got this space heater to compensate in the mornings to quickly warm up the space.  But, with this damn machine automatically deciding on it's own to switch to the lower wattage...it's impossible to warm anything up quickly..or at all for that matter!! NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO KEEP IT AT THE FULL WATTAGE....IT DOES NOT WORK!!!  Plus, there is no real indicator mark on the dial itself.  You never know, is this where the full on setting should be...or is it here?  Plus the directions give no indication either...you just never know what to line any of the dials marking to.  THEN, HERE'S THE BEST PART!!  In their direction packet they have a big STOP sign sheet that says, "Don't take this item back to where you bought it, CALL US...here's our 1-800 number, we'll be glad to help and answer any questions."  I called them for four days straight and all I ever got was an answering maching.  Finally on the 5th day I left a message.  I wanted someone to explain the internal workings of this machine so that I could have some control over the wattage settings.  That same day I also sent them an email...to this day I have heard NOTHING...no phone call back, no email...NOTHING!!! How's that for customer support! WAIT.... THERE'S MORE... I figured, well as a last resource I can put this machine down in my basement to help keep it warm so my pipes don't freeze (cold upstate New York winters).  Another "feature" of this machine is that there is what's called a "Snowflake" setting, especially for use in basements.  You plug it in, put it on the setting (again not really knowing where to really line the little snowflake image up to) and The machine will automatically come on when the room reaches below 41 degrees.  Well, I keep a thermometer in my basement...when I placed this heater in my basement the temp on the thermometer was 38 degrees.  That means as soon as I plug the thing in, it should turn on, right?  HA!!! Fat chance!!!  I stood there for 20 minutes, playing with the dial, trying to see what it did, and it did nothing!  I went downstairs about 3 times during the course of the night, and though my basement kept getting colder, the heater never came on. URRRGGGGGGHHHH...I HATE THIS MACHINE...DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE MASTER OF YOUR HEATING DOMAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!

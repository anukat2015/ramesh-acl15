Title: LEAKY MESS
Content:
My husband bought this coffee pot after I suffered some burns using a French press coffee pot early in the morning before I was fully awake. I have two complaints about this coffee pot: 1)it leaks all over the counter and 2) it doesn't make 12 cups of coffee at the strength I prefer because if I load enough coffee into basket to get the taste we like, it backs up into the water reserve.
I will give it one star because I do like the taste of the coffee I get using the maximum amount of coffee with eight cups of water.

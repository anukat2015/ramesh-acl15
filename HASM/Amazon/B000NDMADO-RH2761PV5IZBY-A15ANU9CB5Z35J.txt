Title: Money Well Spent
Content:
Finally, a well engineered product worth it's price.  Some people pay thousands of dollars for a vacuum that is no better than this one.  Others have complained about the hose kinking. Used properly, this isn't a problem.  The suction is great.  It stows away nicely.  The only bad thing I can say about this vacuum is that the electrical cord is a little too short.

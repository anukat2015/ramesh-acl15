Title: Did someone say tea?
Content:
Thats what the coffee looks like after it brews!
After many days searching for a coffeemaker I stumbled upon this one at Williams Sonoma, paid more there by the way. Well it"s going back to them tomorrow. 
PRO's, there really is none except if you are looking for something pretty to sit on your countertop for decoratation. 
CONS, many . This brews the weakest coffee I have ever had. I even resorted to rebrewing the pot it made and still no taste,
The coffee comes out a light yellowbrown see-thru color, not dark and rich. 
The water level is a bit hard to read.
Coffee does NOT stay hot for more then 10 minutes,
Does not seal shut, had steam coming out in places it never ever should .
Clock is impossible to read
Ready beep, well lets say don't wander more then 5 feet away to hear it!
LOTS & LOTS of coffee grinds ended up in my cup , disgusting
This model should have been pulled from shelfs a year ago.

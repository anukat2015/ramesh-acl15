Title: It's much easier and better than people make out
Content:
I won't waste time talking about the coffee - it's perfect - as good as any good coffee machine.  But it is exceptionally attractive.  Cleaning - takes 2 mins, I just rinse it and let it dry on the counter top.  Temperature - the coffee will cool down, so after a few hours just zap it for 30s and it will be perfect, and infintely better than leaving it stewing on a heated plate.  A good buy, and I don't regret it one bit.

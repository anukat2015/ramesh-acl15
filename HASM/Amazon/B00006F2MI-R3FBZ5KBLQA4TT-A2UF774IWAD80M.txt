Title: Just not that difficult to use
Content:
I got this coffee maker as a gift and I love it. Rinsing out the grinder is a bit of a pain but it takes one whole 1 minute. You can use pre-ground beans and eliminate that problem. I find the coffee is hot for hours.  The noise of the grinder sounds like any grinder.  None are quiet. No big deal.  I use enough beans to make a strong coffee and it's great.  The extra 1-2 minutes a day are worth it!

Title: Awesome possum
Content:
This thing is amazing. Better than any iPod or Zen. Huge screen, and has a touch scroll for fun. Never freezes and is a great price. The only downside is the crappy Zune computer software. It takes 30 seconds to change picture folders or switch from Device to Collection, I recommend using Windows Media Player. But all in all, neato mosquito.

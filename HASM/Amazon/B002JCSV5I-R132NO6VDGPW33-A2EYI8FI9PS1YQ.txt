Title: Nikon D3000 review
Content:
Have had this camera a week and its alot of fun! Way better than the little point and shoot digi.cameras. Have owned afew 35mm slr's,but this is my first dslr and i gotta say it is very user friendly. As i get to know my way around its functions,new ideas keep driving me to experiment with the camera. This Nikon is a great way to get introduced to digital photography.

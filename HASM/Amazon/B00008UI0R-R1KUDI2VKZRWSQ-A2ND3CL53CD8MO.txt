Title: A very happy camper
Content:
The first time I used the wind tunnel my nose felt like the clothse pins had been taken off. My breathing was much improved. Apparently the fine dust that before used to be re dispersed in the air was now trapped in the vacuum behind the two hepa filters. I slept well that night without the sinus congestion problems that were the norm before.
We have deep shag rugs that held loads of fine dust, now the hepa filters and the stronger suction of our new machine are removing this tenacious visitor.
A local contractor who cleans the court house told me his contract specifies the use of hepa vacuum filters. These filters are not a gimmick. They were developed to remove fine uranium dust from the air when working on nuclear bombs. 
Since getting this vacuum I have purchased a hepa filter for my work shop vacuum.

Title: Great for videos, better for photos at Low Light
Content:
You should go to dpreview to get a very detailed review since my opinion will be absolutely short and concise. I got the so popular 5D2 some months ago, maybe I was one of the first to pick it up at adorama store in NYC. I had the chance to try it under very differnet lignting conditions and let me tell you this is one of the best cameras at low light ever I can shot printable photos even at Iso 6400 with no lose on quality, the noise is simply too low to be considered, same opinion I have on video quality, the 5D2 rocks, the DOF is fantastic when you use fast lenses, like the 85mm f1.8, however everything is not perfect, my only two gripes, are the poor battery life and the old AF system...thats all. Maybe you wanna see a personal noise test with samples at FS. Check it out on the link below.

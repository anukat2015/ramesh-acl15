Title: great vaccuum!
Content:
It's a great vacuum. I love the telescoping wand - now I don't need to bend over so much when vacuuming! Great feature that was a surprise. My only complaint is that I hit the on/off button with my hand when vacuuming, it's slightly too high on the handle, but it's something that I can live with! Does a great job with dog hair!

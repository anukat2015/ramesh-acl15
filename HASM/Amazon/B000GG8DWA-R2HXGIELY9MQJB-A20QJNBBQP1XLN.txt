Title: soft glow, nice warm heat!
Content:
I love this little heater.  I use it on the coldest days when I am either reading, watching TV or involved in a craft project.  On the coldest of days when there is a chill in the air, it is like having a little piece of hot summer sun warming you.  It warms the object in front of it or near it.  I have used another heater of this type, but the light was way too bright.  This reflects a nice warm glow.  The price is super and If I get a year or two use out of it, I will be very happy.  I recommend this radiant heater because it works well, is light weight and can be used almost anywhere.

Title: Fantastic sem-pro DSLR
Content:
I have used Sony Alpha, Nikon D60, Canon EOS10D, Canon Xsi DSLR's.  Purchased the Pentax K7 to take pictures of wildlife in all weather conditions.  So far, the Pentax K7 DSLR has performed flawlessly.  It is quiet in shutter operation and offers many functional choices for tweaking your photos.  Haven't tried the video recording yet, as I am mainly using it for still photography.  Only had a few days and will try many more of the features in the next few days.
An excellent value, high build quality and durable construction. Kit lense is also of excellent quality and construction.
I am very satisfied with the performance and picture quality of the Pentax K7 DSLR.

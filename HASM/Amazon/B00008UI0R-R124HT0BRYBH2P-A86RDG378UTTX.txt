Title: Great Canister Vacuum
Content:
I love this vacuum. I won't let anybody in my house use it but me. I had a Dirt Devil before and was very pleased with it. But now that I have the Hoover Wind Tunnel I am so very happy. I should have spent more money on a better vacuum a long time ago. I have a cat and to see how the Wind tunnel cleans the rugs and the cat bed is great. It get's up all that hidden dirt that people walk in and get's into the rugs. I like the way it is set up with the controls on the handle. And the different power suctions. But I agree with everybody else the electric cord should be a little longer, but all in all I love this Vacuum.

Title: NewAir Air-N-Water AF350
Content:
Purchased item the middle of 2008. Due to pleasant weather did not use it until 2009. In 2009 it worked for 2 months then failed. The warranty period was about out but they sent a new unit after I returned the original. It worked for 2 months then failed. They would not return my email or phone calls. I cannot find a source for buying parts if I can determine the problem. It's a couple of hundred dollars down the drain. I should have researched more before buying it. I see on the internet that there are many complaints against this group and some have filed claims with the CA States attorney.

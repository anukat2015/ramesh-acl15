Title: Cord does not charge IPOD and Lock Switch Broken
Content:
The USB cord that came with the IPOD does not work and will not charge the IPOD. I had to use a friends cord to charge it and will have to buy another one on my own.  Also, the lock button (switch) at top of IPOD does not work, you have to shift it back and forth multiple times before the IPOD becomes locked.  
Other then those two pretty big things the IPOD works good.

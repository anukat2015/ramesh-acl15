Title: Don't be upset at the size.
Content:
This is a wonderful heater. We were concerned when we took it out of the box due to its size. But, we quickly learned that it is a MORE efficient heater than the ones we were using that are 3-4 times its size. We are heating our 24'x 12' livingroom with just this and it is doing a GREAT job.

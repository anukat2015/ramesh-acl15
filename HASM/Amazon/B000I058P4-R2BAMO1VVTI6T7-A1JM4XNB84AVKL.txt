Title: If you like the taste of plastic.....
Content:
then this coffeemaker is for you.  While my first cup is hot enough, it doesn't stay hot.  The second cup has already cooled way too much.  I find myself nuking at the second cup.  The lid is very awkward, holds liquid inside that is difficult to get rid of, stains my sink if left to drain out.  I do like the coffee basket, comes out easily to clean.  Not too difficult to pour water into the tank, but the level indicator is hard to read.  Makes coffee really fast which is the very best thing about this one.  Bottom line, some pros some cons, as with all machines.  But the deal breaker is, I can't get rid of the plastic taste.  I've only had it a couple months and I'm looking to replace it.  I have another Black & Decker flagged as it's gotten almost 5 stars, but I'm scared it may, too, have that awful plastic taste.

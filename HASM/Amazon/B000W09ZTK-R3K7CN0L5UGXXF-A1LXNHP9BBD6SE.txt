Title: Great product.  Clip needs to be redesigned
Content:
Great product.  Clip needs to be redesigned again.  This is my second Sansa clip.  My dog ate the first.  The first clip broke too easily so I glued it back on and continued using it.  The new one I just bought has a removable clip(new design)but it slips off all too often.  Great product.  I would buy another.  Great for working out or jogging.  Beats the apple shuffle by higher capability for high bps mp3 files and versatility.

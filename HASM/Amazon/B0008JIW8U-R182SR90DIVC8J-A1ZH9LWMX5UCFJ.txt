Title: Cute and functional
Content:
I thought it was just me when it seemed to lose time. Last time the power went out, I set the stove, micro and coffee pot at the same time and sure enough the next day the coffee pot was 3 minutes behind. That aside...this unit is really enjoyable for me. My husband does not drink coffee, so the four cup size is perfect, I usually have one cup at the home and fill up my traveller with just one pot. It is compact and has a lot of the features of a larger machine (pause and serve, delayed/timed brew), plus a place to tuck the cord inside the unit so it is not hanging out all over the counter. One minor issue (besides the clock) is sometimes the lid does not stay snapped down and steam leaks out the top. Still a very easy to use machine.

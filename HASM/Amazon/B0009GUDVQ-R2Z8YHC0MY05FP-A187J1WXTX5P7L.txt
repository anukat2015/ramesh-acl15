Title: excellent sound quality
Content:
I used to own an Ipod Mini and I couldn't believe how bad the sound was.  When I heard good reviews about the NW-HD5's sound quality I decided to get one.  The good reviews are justified.  Sound quality is indeed superior to that of the Ipod.  I mean, it's still not home-theater quality but it's excellent considering it is a portable device holding thousands of songs after all.

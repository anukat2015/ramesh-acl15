Title: Best ever
Content:
I needed a new coffee maker...had a $100 gift certificate for Starbucks so I went there to buy a coffee maker. I found a Cuisinart for $129 and took it home and used it a few times. I hated it. I returned it for cash and went out and bought this Krups for $59. I totally love this coffee maker. All the features other editors wrote about work wonderfully well except sometimes the water level indicator does get bubbles in it and that is a disappointment to me. But I just look at the water in the pot now and use it to measure it.

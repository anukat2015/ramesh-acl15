Title: Working Great So Far
Content:
I've had mine for about a week now, and I'm really enjoying it.  I have used it as a full-on laptop and I have also used it connected to my wireless keyboard/mouse and larger monitor.  The screen quality is great both on the laptop screen and when I plugged in a larger desktop monitor.  Windows 7 is nice and so far it runs pretty fast.
The blue color is very dark/subtle (more so than it looks in the pictures here), so if you want a really BLUE one, this might not be it, but if you're not sure you want a blue one, it looks black most of the time anyway.
I don't find the speaker quality to be very good at all.  It's loud but kind of unbalanced (tinny, maybe) to my ears.  It sounds great with headphones or my external speakers, though.
Built-in keyboard and mouse are fine, and I do appreciate having the number pad - can't live without that.
I'm not a gamer and I haven't done anything really intensive with this yet, but so far I'm very pleased.

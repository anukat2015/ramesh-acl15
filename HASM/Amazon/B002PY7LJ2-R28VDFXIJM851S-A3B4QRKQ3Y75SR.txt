Title: A lot going for it
Content:
I bought this as a gift for a friend, but set it up and used it for a few weeks first. It is a deal, for sure. Ideal for a portable life. The 15" laptops are too big and heavy IMHO. Used this one on a flight without feeling cramped. Had a Samsung netbook before, which was great but the 10" screen is too small for serious work. 11.6" is a perfect screen size, for travel at least. I got over 5 hours on the battery, which is great. I was surprised at how fast it starts up and shuts down, must be the Windows 7? And it's an attractive machine too. My only complaint, and it is a serious one, is the flat keys. The Samsung has it beat there, by a yard, and my ThinkPad keyboard is in another league all together. All my future laptops will be 12 inch.

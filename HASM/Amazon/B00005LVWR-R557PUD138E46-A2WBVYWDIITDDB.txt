Title: I am Italian living in Italy GREAT COFFEE MACHINE
Content:
I am glad that I was given this opportunity, I was not even aware that this wonderful company and in particular this wonderful machine had reached the american market.It has been for me one of the hardest thing to ever find a drinkable espresso in the USA, I have lived there for about 7 years all over the place from the east to the west coast. I had to almost close my nose to be able to ever drink an espresso. The all time I had been wondering how distorted was american idea of an espresso, thinking that the black water they use to serve was called espresso. Finally with this machine you will be able to drink a class one espresso better than any you have probably every tried, A LOT BETTER THAN STARBUCKS TOO.Saeco is one of the top brand in Italy, it has always made only good products, and this is the model that I have, in my opinion the best model made.The machine alone will not do the trick, by the way you will need good coffee too, do not use pure arabica, Arabica is the best type of coffe but on it's own it makes no foam. It has to be mixed with other kinds.I highly recommend using ILLY, it is probably the best coffe ever sold through out the world.

Title: 100% Satisfied!
Content:
I already had a MacBook Pro 17" that was about 2 years old. I jumped on the chance of a new one with 0% interest for 24 months through Amazon! 
The MacBooks are the way to go if you do anything with video and music. If you don't, you'll probably be just as content with a cheaper PC. 
I have never had a Mac freeze up on me or shut down when editing video like I have had a PC do. 
I really like the back lit keyboard on this new one. It's also a little faster than my old one. I had just added 2 more GB to my old one too! I'm keeping it. I'll use one for music and one for video.

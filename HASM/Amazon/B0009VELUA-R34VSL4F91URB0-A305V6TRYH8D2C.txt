Title: Cuisinart DDC-2000 is crappy
Content:
I have a Cuisinart DCC-2000 which runs coffee all over the counter. I make the coffee and turn the pot off, then pour single cups and heat them in the microwave throughout the day because I worry about electrical fires if the pot is left on. I pour one cup, then make sure the pour lever is off. It can be off for hours, and then all of a sudden the pour lever just turns on by itself and a whole pot of coffee pours all over the counter. This d*mn maker cost over $100. The coffemaker is a piece of crap. The coffee was barely warm when it first is made, and every pot after that never was very hot, and then it cools off so fast that it's cold in minutes, but I kept it because I heat coffee in the microwave any way. This last problem of it running all over the counter just p*sses me off. I've only had it four months and use it very little.  It's like new.  Plus the warranty requires we keep the original receipt. I had dozens of items on the first receipt and wound up taking another item back and they kept the receipt by mistake. So warranty-wise, even though I sent the filled out warranty in, I'm told they won't honor it. I guess mine goes in the trash and I NEVER buy another Cuisinart product again.

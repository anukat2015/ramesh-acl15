Title: in love!
Content:
This is my first ipod and I love it!  I had a Creative Zen before this, and while the Zen is a great product, I'm so glad I got the nano.
The small size is perfect and I take it everywhere!  And to be honest, it was the color that sold me.  I love the yellow!  The screen is so vivid and I love the updates to the product.  The shake action to shuffle is pretty cool too.

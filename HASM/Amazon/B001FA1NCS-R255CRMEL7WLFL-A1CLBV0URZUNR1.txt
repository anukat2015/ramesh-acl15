Title: Not as satisfied as I hoped
Content:
I decided to upgrade from my mini to the new 4th generation Nano. I was excited to see that the Nano finally came in 16GB so I can start putting videos on there without worrying about using up a ton of space.  I like the lean look and the screen is very clear and a great size. There are a few disappointing things that I found out though.  First of all, any of the charging accessories you have for any prior nano or mini will not work with the 4th generation model, so I had to purchase all new ones. If you own a portable speaker, it will still play, but the charge function is not supported. The battery life doesn't seem to last as long as the older models. The shake fuction is not that impressive.  If you are in a playlist and use the shake function, it will shake from your entire library instead of the that specific playlist, so the feature is useless in that sense. I'm having issues where I'll will be scrolling through my songs or just listening to them and it will take it upon itself to reset.  I called Apple and they told me that some of my files can be corrupt, but I told him that I didn't have this issue with my mini, so he suggested that I try restoring the settings and hopefully that will work--otherwise back to the store it goes :(

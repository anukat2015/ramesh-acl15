Title: Bad Glass!!!! Check Yours!!!
Content:
I'm currently waiting my third replacement MacBook Pro. My first two new ones arrived with imperfections in the glass. As if the glass had a speck or bubble within it.  It is very easy to miss once it's turned on, but it's there and I imagine can develop into a crack. The way to check yours is to make sure the screen is completely cleaned and Off. Then if you can't quite see it, put a flash light to the screen and scan it. More often than not, you'll find imperfections in the glass that will not come off. It's a manufacturing problem.

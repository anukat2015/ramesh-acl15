Title: Perfect for small spaces
Content:
This is a great heater for small spaces, or for a cold-natured person in a room with hot-natured people.  It heats only what it's directed at, and is not intended to warm up an entire  room.  I use it for plants I'm wintering in the garage and it works great without trying to heat the entire garage.

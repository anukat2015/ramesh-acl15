Title: Best Little Heater That COULD!!
Content:
Look, I can't speak to whatever technical issues / bad luck people are having with this heater - but it is single handedly saving us much $$$$ over the last 2 years.  We are about to buy it for friends this Christmas so i thought i'd rave about it some.
1.  This is powerful and quiet enough.  It can really heat up a large room (our townhome has cathedral 14 ft ceilings throughout, so lots of heat gets lost up there) in a small amount of time and really packs a punch!  It's not whisper quiet, but you also don't notice it - so it's perfect.
2.  The functions and features work great.  We keep it set to a temperature when we go to bed in our bedroom - we put the unit on my wife's side of the bed, and the remote on my side - that way we know the heat will reach all the way over to me.  It really does a great job keeping on, getting to your pre-set temp and them autmoatically turning itself off in the middle of the night (however many times that is) - what a great way to keep warm and NOT have to warm the entire rest of the house and waste gas!
Go for it - i HIGHLY recommend it!

Title: Excellent Product...Without The Promotion
Content:
I ordered my second Flavia today.  It has become a staple in the household, with all four adults and kids using it on a daily basis.  
The holiday promotion Amazon is offering is a little suspicious -- Spend $125 or more in your order and get $25 off the total.  The only problem is that the 'order' can consist ONLY of the Flavia machine, which costs $120.  So, there's no way to redeem the $25 discount.  
Outside of that, the Flavia is worth the purchase price.

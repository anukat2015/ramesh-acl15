Title: Great for cold spots!
Content:
This has saved my life.  I live in a split-level house, and my entry levels are always too cold while my upstairs are always too hot.  Speedheat has saved me by allowing me to just heat one room at a time...and you don't have to rip up your floors to use it either!  - just throw it under a rug, plug it in, and go!

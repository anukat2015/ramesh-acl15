Title: NOT worth the money
Content:
For the price (around 70US), get a better no name at Walmart for example.
I purchased one from Walmart and I had it for a couple of years; it is still working fine but it was used to vacuum our cars. For the house and small jobs, I said I should buy a brand. Wrong decision.
This one
- NO indicator for bag replacement
- NOT powerful enough - it barely gets the dirt off a plain surface (no carpets)
- extremely noisy
- bags are pricey compared to other brands
I am so dissatisfied with it that I might give it away as a gift to someone interested.

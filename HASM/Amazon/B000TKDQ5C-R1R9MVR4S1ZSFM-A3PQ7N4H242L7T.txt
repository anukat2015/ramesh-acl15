Title: quiet space heater
Content:
...the Lasko 754200 is one of the better space heaters I've purchased over the years. It's low and high settings are quiet and produce little vibration to annoy you while in a quiet environment. It is cool to the touch on all parts but the front. The only complaint I have is that it is awkward to pick up with one hand; if you pick it up by the built-in handle, chances are you will drop it as it's very slippery and only allows you to get hold of it by 1".

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I purchased the Vornado DVH Vortex based on the reviews.  I ve converted my garage into a home office and I was looking for an economical way to provide heat.The pros: Stays cool to the touch even when ran for a long period of time. The fan is quiet.The controls are simple to use. The cons:  The fan is weak. If you sit further than 4 feet you cannot feel the force of the fan. The air circulation is poor.This could be a good product if the fan could be improved.

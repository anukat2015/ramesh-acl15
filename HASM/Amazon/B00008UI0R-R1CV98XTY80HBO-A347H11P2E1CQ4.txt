Title: A good quality for the buck!
Content:
It is a good vacuum cleaner. I am so happy to be back to using a canister one: it is so much more convinient in the staircase, easy to manoeuver (especially under furniture) and as efficient as an upright. It is also  great for use in the car.
My only complaint about this model is what a lot of other people noticed too. The dust canister is small and if you have a lot of carpet it will need to be emptied every couple of rooms. That part can get messy (although easy to do). The filter is better off cleaned outside and it can take a while to do so.
Over all, I am happy with this purchase which comes at an unbeatable price and was praised by Consummer Report.

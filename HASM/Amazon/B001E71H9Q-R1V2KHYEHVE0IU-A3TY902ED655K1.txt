Title: Great laptop
Content:
Super light, super fast, and runs cool even in performance mode.  Vista seems to be smooth as silk.  4-cell battery can run for hours when antenna is off.  Otherwise battery runs about 2 and 1/2 hours when running intensively.  Extremely satisfied.  Mouse buttons took only a bit to get used to.  Turns out they are much more efficient than the touch pads of late...previously used Gateway.  Highly recommend.  I upgraded 3G of RAM for about $40 dollars I think and maxed out processor for same amount approximately.  Great notebook for mobile people.  I am a student.  Oh, the lack of optical drive is taking some getting used to.  Requires transfer from desktop to flash and then to Thinkpad.  May consider a USB optical drive at a later date but not likely since most new files are downloaded anyway.  Hope this helps.

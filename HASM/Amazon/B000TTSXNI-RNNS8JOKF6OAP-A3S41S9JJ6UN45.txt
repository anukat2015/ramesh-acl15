Title: I'm sure it is fine when it works...
Content:
Package arrived from Amazon in good shape. I opened it and unpacked the unit, plugged it in and pushed the powwer button. It immediately generated heat - nice! After roughly 30 seconds, it just quit. The power light went from green to red and I pushed every button multiple times. Other than some beeps, nothing. The instructions say if this happens it is probably the overheating safety feature, so unplug and wait 15-30 minutes. I did this. Still nothing. Unplugged and waited over an hour. This time, the green power light came on for about 5 sseconds, and then back to red and a totally unresponisve unit. I'm not willing to spend time fooling with it. Back it goes!

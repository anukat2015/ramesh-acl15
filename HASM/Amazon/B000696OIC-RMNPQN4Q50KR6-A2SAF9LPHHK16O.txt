Title: not worth the money
Content:
I have had this coffe maker for over one year. I am the only one in our family that can use this pot because everthing has to be lined up just so or it will overflow. The style of the lid is very annoying, you point the arrows in the right spot and it pours fine but if its off just a hair you have a mess and burning coffee on you hands! The coffe stays hot about 4 hours. I think the strength adjuster is hoax.

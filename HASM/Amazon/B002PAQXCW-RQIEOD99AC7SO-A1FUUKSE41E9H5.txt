Title: This laptop will give you a BSOD
Content:
If you are like any other users browsing through laptops to purchase,
Asus G51J-A1 seemed attractive due to its beast Spec, and reasonable price.
But you WILL be dissappointed.
I had purchased this laptop and I found that I really regretted my decision.
It's pointless to buy a gaming laptop that BSOD'd very frequently when playing games.
Some users might have not experienced it as often, or even at all,
They might be wondering whether they were the lucky ones for not getting BSOD.
 
but it's not a question of IF it will BSOD
it's a question of WHEN
[...]
do NOT buy this laptop.

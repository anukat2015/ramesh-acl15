Title: Beware of lemons
Content:
I received my Canon Digital Rebel XT in 1/08. Despite some minor complaints with the design of the camera, I enjoyed it for just over  12 months until it seemed the battery was quickly fizzling out and then suddenly stopped powering on all together.  I thought it was a poor battery so I ordered 2 more, which had no effect. Canon tech support was compltely useless and bascially told me that the only option was to send it in.  There are not local shops to fix these cameras because they are so intricate and specialized. So I went ahead and spent the money to send it in, which isn't cheap when you add the insurance factor.  Now I just found out that it will cost $228 to get the thing fixed.  That's a lot of money for something I owned for such a short period of time!  However, I feel it has to be paid because of the amount of money I already invested in it and how much more it would cost just to buy a new camera.  To add to my frustrations they never indicated what was wrong with the camera.  All I was told was how much it would cost to fix it.  Just like another reviewer asked, is it wrong to think that such an expensive piece of equipment should last longer than 13-14 months?  Needless to say I have lost my faith in Canon and don't plan on buying another one of their cameras.  Now that I go back and look at these camera reviews again I am seeing that other people had the same problem as me...what a disappointment.
FYI - Should this happen to you and you haven't sent your camera in yet, the written warranty is 12 months, but the Canon repair rep told us they will honor warranty repairs up to 14 months (they don't advertise that).

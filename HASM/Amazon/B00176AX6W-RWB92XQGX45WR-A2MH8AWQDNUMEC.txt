Title: The Zune is perfect for a PC user
Content:
I've had ipods since it's 2nd generation, and just bought a zune. It's a great mp3 player, the only one i've ever used that is even comparable to the ipod. The touchpad is fantastic and can scroll much quicker than the ipod's circle, the ui is prettier, and the screen is twice the size.  The ipod classic 80 gb competitor is a fantastic mp3 player, but the zune is the only one that gives it a run for its money.
Also, Zune media runs much better on a pc than itunes does.

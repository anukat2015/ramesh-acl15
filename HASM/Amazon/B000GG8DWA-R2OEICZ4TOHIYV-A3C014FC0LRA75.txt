Title: Excellent and quiet personal heater
Content:
Virtually all "space heaters" on the market run a fan while they are on, which creates a droning background noise in a small quiet office environment. This model has no fan, so it is absolutely silent. Plus, this model generates a sufficient amount of personal comfort (even in a room where the main heat is set to 62 degrees) at one of its 2 energy-saving wattage settings: 400 watts or 800 watts. Most space heaters run at (and require) 1200-1600 watts. Plus, the price ($26.75 delivered, via Amazon) makes this a no-brainer.  Don't expect this heater to warm up a whole room, that's not what it is for. It does make a great personal heater (and a quiet one at that), and will save on your overall heating bill.

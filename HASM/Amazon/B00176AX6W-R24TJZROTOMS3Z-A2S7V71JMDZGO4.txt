Title: Will not honor warranty
Content:
Zune will not warranty the player if the screen is cracked no matter what. My screen was cracked because of a malfunction in the battery and Zune reps said we would have to pay $79.99 for a replacement. They had my player for two months and never mentioned it not being covered by warranty. Then they sent back the player I sent in. The player has never been dropped, so that is not the problem. The cracked screen is only a symptom. The player will not power on nor will it charge. Still Zune will not honor the warranty. I was told they test to see what makes the screen crack and that is why a cracked screen is not covered. Basically saying the player has to be mishandled for the screen to crack. Well, my Zune is here to prove them wrong. Now I am out $250 and I have to by a new mp3 player. I think I'll buy an ipod.

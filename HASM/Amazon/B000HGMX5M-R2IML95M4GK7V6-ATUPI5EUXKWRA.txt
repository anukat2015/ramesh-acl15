Title: Excellent camera and lens combination!
Content:
I have been using compact digital cameras for many years and recently upgraded to the Nikon D80 after months of internet review searching.  I found this camera to fit my needs perfectly.  The quality of the photos has been great; more camera features than I know what to do with; it feels the best in my hand of all of the digital SLRs; and love owning a Nikon!  Although I have the standard kit 18-55mm lens, which does great at landscapes and short range portrait photography, I did purchase the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens which has been fantastic as my one lens to take while traveling.  I had some concerns after reading reviews about lens creep, but have found my lens to be quite tight so far; no lens creep whatsoever.  The VR works great in low light and for longer zoom photos with noticeably improved sharpness.  I chose the 18-200mm over adding a 70-300mm or some other zoom lens to compliment the kit lens mainly so I would not have to carry two lenses while traveling.  The 18-200mm works extremely well as my "do it all" lens.
In summary, I highly recommend the Nikon D80 in any lens configuration you choose.  Go for it!!

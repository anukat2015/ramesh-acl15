Title: FANTASTIC!
Content:
I am getting up dirt that I never knew was in my carpet.  I vacuumed twice and emptied out loads of fine sand and dirt. My old one gave up the ghost and I have been using my friend's Dyson.  This vacuum totally outcleans anything I have seen or used.  I love it!  It's easy to use, just pull out the large capacity cup and empty out; filter is easy to clean, and it takes up little space.  Plus, with a canister vac I can clean under the furniture.....oh, and it cleans great around the edges.

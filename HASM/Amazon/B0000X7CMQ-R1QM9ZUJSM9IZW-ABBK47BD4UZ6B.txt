Title: A Coffee Powerhouse!!
Content:
I bought this machine after deciding I was tired of the bitter tasting bean juice produced by my hotplate machine.  I read many reviews, and finally settled on this coffeemaker by Jojirushi (a company I was not previously familiar with).  It definitely lives up to its overwhelmingly good reviews.  It produces wonderfully flavored (I like it on the strong side), perfectly hot coffee in a matter of minutes, and the carafe keeps it hot for hours.
The #4 filters stick up a little over the filter tray, but this is negligible, and hasn't created any problems.  I plan on getting a metal filter soon anyway.  The water spout must be swung out of the way to put your grounds in, but is pushed back in place automatically when you close the lid, so it's practically fool proof.  I've read complaints about the lid, but personally find it to be very easy to open and close, and have had no problems whatsoever.
In short, I love my Jojirushi, and give it my highest reccommendation!!!

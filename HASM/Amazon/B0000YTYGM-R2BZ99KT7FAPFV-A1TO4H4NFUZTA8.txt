Title: Totally disappointed, returned after 1 week
Content:
I read the other reviews and was very excited to get this coffee maker.  I was particularly excited by the review where the woman said her coffee stayed hot even after she returned from church group. 
I have had the opposite experience.  The coffee isn't even that hot from the first pour and 1 hour later, I'm back to microwaving it.  Another nit is that it pours so slowly from the decanter, but obviously, if it was hot, I would ignore this minor problem.
This machine is heading back to Amazon today and now I need to research its replacement.

Title: The best buy, trust me
Content:
I am a serisous critic of products and I will tell you this is the coolest and easiast vacuum cleaner to use and operate.  It is by far the best vacuum on the market today!  I have several cats and it picks up all the hair and never loses it's suction.  I do not recommend any other vacuum than the Electrolux EL 7055A.
Thank you for selling a great product for a great price Amazon.

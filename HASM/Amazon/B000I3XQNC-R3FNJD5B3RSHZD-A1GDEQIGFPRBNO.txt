Title: Great, affordable digital SLR
Content:
This is a very nice fully automatic digital SLR, which is very similar in operation to my old Canon A-1 film camera, while incorporating additional features available in digital photography. The built-in electronic flash works great in full-auto mode, producing good exposures over greater distance than I expected. 
Older lenses with Canon mounts cannot be used with this camera, since the mount has been changed (from FD mount to EF mount), but the Canon Speedlite 199A will work, although automatic flash exposure info is not communicated to the camera. (Be sure any external flash voltage is 6V or less, however). Also, a method of attaching the lens cap to the lens or camera should be considered, because the lens cap latches are very easily released if bumped, which can result in a lost lens cap.

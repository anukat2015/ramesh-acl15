Title: continues shooting mode question?
Content:
I own this XSI camera for few months now, I am having problem shooting in continues mode, I can only shoot continues in sport mode and can get about 9 images. If I switch to AV or Manual mode I can only shoot about 2-3 images in JPEG format and 4-5 images in RAW then it will say "busy" for 2 to 3 second. Does anyone else experience this problem or just me? Maybe I am doing something wrong? any suggestion or comments? 
Other than that it's a good and reasonable price camera, the construction is average, the corner of this camera's body already starting to peeling off after few month of use but that will not effect the image quality. The image quality is great I have no complaint other than the continues shooting mode problem that I had since I am shooting my 2 year old daughter running all the time. overall it's worth the money $800 you don't expect much you know. My 24-70mm L lens cost more than the body. 
Drop me some comments on the continues shooting mode problem I would really appreciated.

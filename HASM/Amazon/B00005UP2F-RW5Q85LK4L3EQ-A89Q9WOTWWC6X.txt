Title: Be careful of the handle
Content:
I have owned this vacuum for about a year and I am very satisfied with how it  works. My one caution to people is to be careful not to pick it up from the handle attached to the dust collector. I did this once without realizing it and the vacuum fell on my foot, breaking several bones. Now that I have owned a bag-less vacuum, I wouldn't choose to buy another. Cleaning it out the filter and dust collector is very messy and dusty!

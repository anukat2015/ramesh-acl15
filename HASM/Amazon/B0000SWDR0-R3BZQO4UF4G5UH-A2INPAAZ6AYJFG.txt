Title: Big Mistake
Content:
I wish I had read the reviews on this vacuum before I purchased it.  I have owned it for less than five months and, as of yesterday, am the satisfied new owner of a Dyson.  I became so frustrated everytime I used it.  I could not believe the issues with the power nozzle always turning to the right.  I showed it to several people and they all had the same opinion as me, it is the worse design ever.  Although I thought the suction was good, I ran the electrolux and then followed up with the Dyson and it was just amazing how much dirt, dust, carpet fuzz.... was picked up by the Dyson after I thought the rug was clean from the electrolux.  Customer service was very poor from Electrolux.  I emailed 3 times before I got a response which said that I needed to call customer service.  They just said they designed the vacuum with the wayward power head and there was nothing they would/could do.  Do not buy this vacuum.

Title: Great, but Support is Lacking
Content:
When it comes to MP3's, this player is a 5.
When it comes to Videos, it's a 1
Don't get me wrong, it plays video's pretty well.  Nice screen, awesome coloration, etc.
But just TRY to FIND a converter, which costs a lot of money, try to convert it to exactly the right bit rate, right size, etc, good luck.  Oh, and where to get a tutorial or manual on it?  Oh, there is none.  Nice.
So if you're into MP3's, buy this.  If you into Videos, you have to be a serious e-video geek who is well versed in cracks to figure this stuff out.  Because normal people will have trouble with it.
BTW, this is coming from a computer programmer who also has a home studio for music and mixes and masters on the PC.

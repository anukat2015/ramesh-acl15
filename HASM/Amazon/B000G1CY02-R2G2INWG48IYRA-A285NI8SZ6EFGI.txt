Title: Works Great for 1 year
Content:
I ordered four of these heaters.  They work great for about one year (when the warrenty is up) and then they start sparking and making noise.  A few days later the units inside go completely out and they don't work anymore.  At least that's what happened to two of mine already.  I actually ordered another to replace one of them and it was defective.  Unless you plan to purchase these each year, I would not recommend.

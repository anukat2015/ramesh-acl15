Title: Good Camera, Good Price
Content:
Bought from Adorama, quick service, shipping status, great price.
I decided to save a few hundred dollars and buy the XT instead of the XTi.  I've been very happy with it.  Great pictures and overall, very easy to use.  The kit lens is cheaply made and a little slow to focus, but photo quality is good, and the 18-55mm range is appropriate for the smaller sensor.
As others have commented, the grip is probably more suited to the average woman's hand than a man's, and can be uncomfortable with on-camera flash.  Also, no ISO shown on the LCD.  Since you can change ISO so easily, it would be nice to have a quick reminder what it's set for, and not get extra noise when you don't need high ISO.
The software is ok, but a card reader and Photoshop are the way to go.  Adobe Bridge makes working with camera RAW much faster and easier.  If you're a student or know one, you can get MAJOR discounts (about 75%) on Adobe Creative suite or Photoshop through the college bookstore.  
Basically, I would have bought the 30D if I could afford it, but for half the price you definitely get more than 3/4 the camera, with just a few minor differences that you can live with if you're reluctant to part with another 600 bucks.

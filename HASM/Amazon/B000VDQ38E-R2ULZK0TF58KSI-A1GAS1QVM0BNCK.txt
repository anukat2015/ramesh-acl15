Title: Height adjuster doesn't work, tears up my carpet
Content:
I purchased one of these units yesterday, and thought the suction and dirt removal ability were great... Until I realized the debris in the canister was the fiber of my carpet, not pet hair.
Upon inspecting the height adjustment mechanism, I determined there is no way to adjust the height, as the adjuster cam doesn't even touch the wheel assembly.  Either the factory put in the wrong parts, or the product is mis-designed.  Either way, if I could give this machine less than one star, I would.
I'm sending this one straight back for a refund.

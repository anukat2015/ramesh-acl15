Title: Did I buy the same vacuum?????
Content:
DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!! I bought this vacuum about a month ago because of the spectacular reviews that it got.  I think the people who rated this vacuum anything better than one star were either on some sort of happy [daze] or they were paid by Dirt Devil to write a good review.  Either way I was [given misinformation].  THIS VACUUM [is not that good]! The vacuum is hard to lug around and barely picks up anything.  It won't even pick up a paperclip!!  My carpets look dingy.  Emptying the canister is most horrible housecleaning chore I have to endure.  The dirt and dust go flying everywhere. Personally, I don't like being covered by dirt, dog hair, and whatever else might be in there.  That's why I vacuumed it up in the first place.  The filters must be replaced readily and they are just about impossible to find (not to mention costly).  I am planning on buying a different vacuum once I get the money. So do yourself a favor don't take  "this vacuum is so wonderful" reviews as gospel.  The individuals who wrote those reviews obviously do not know what a good vacuum is.

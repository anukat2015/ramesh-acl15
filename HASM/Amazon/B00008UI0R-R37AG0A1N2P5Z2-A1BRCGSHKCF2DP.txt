Title: Great value in vaccums
Content:
After much internet surfing and reading reviews in on-line consumer websites and the Consumer Reports magazine I selected the Hoover S3765-040.  We have two large dogs and two kids.  THe vacuum works well on dog hair and the small handheld powered brush works to get dog hair off furniture.  The power head works wiell on low pile and high pile  carpents.  I've found that using the power head you only need the low suction setting.  Build quality appears good for the price ($179.00 US on Amazon).  My only recommendation is that you buy two of the filters as you clean them by washing so you always have a dry filter for you next vacuum assignment.  
All in all a great vacuum for the price.  Now if I could get my  daughters to learn how to use the vacuum...

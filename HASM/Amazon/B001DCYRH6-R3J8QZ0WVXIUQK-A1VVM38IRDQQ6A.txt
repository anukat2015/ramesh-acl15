Title: wow!!! HVRCH3000
Content:
I searched and searched for a small portable vacuum that was very powerful and the Hoover unit is great!  I have a large cannister (expensive brand) that is difficult to move from room to room and get under furniture.  This mighty little machine is just as powerful, the cord is extra long, great for hardwood, tile, or carpet.  I bought this for all the hard floor surfaces but it would be great to use for carpet if you have a small condo.  It has 7.5 amps and is double insulated.  I bought two, one for the house and one for our RV. My best buy this year!!

This coffeemaker actually keeps me from buying the $4 a cup drive up/walk up window brands. It really does take less than a minute to have a fresh, delicious cup of coffee to grab-n-go. I use it when I am at home, too, and never have stale, burnt, too-weak or too-strong coffee. 
I have tried lots of the different pod brands and flavors and found a few that are perfect for me. I also bought the kit to use to make my own pods and the little holster to hold them, so that I can mix-n-match my own blends right at home. I love it.
Buying this coffeemaker was a really wonderful decision. I tell my friends that I now live in Coffee Heaven.

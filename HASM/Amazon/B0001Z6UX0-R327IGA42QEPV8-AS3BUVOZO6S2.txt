Title: Disappointing
Content:
Shortly after I got this product, the thermostat in the Max Heat option blew out.  So, I can only use the Min Heat option (only 2 options) and it will stay on for days - no problem.  This is obviously too bulkly to easily ship back to Amazon - and I didn't keep the huge cardboard box that covered the manuf. box.  Wouldn't do it again for that reason.

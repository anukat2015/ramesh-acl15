Title: Efficient and Agile, but the main power nozzle head was missing from the box
Content:
I bought this vacuum for my daughter to use in her  apartment of the college.  When I opened the factory original packing, I realized that the power nozzle was not there, I complaint to Amazon, but they told us it past the return date.  When we went online, we saw there were a few bloggers complaint about the same thing.  Of course I went to Hoover website to buy the part, it costs us over $60 + shipping. If this had happened before or happen again, the factory and amazon should acknowledge that, someone is not honest during the packing.  There are so many websites selling just the nozzle, they can make a few bucks. As for the machine itself, it is very good.  It is perfect even for my own 4-bedroom house.  Those tools are very helpful. I  vacuum the lint from my suits and coat, window sills, dressing table ... instead of using the duster (the degree of suction is adjustable, it is almost comparable to another Miele Vacuum cleaner that we also have, but the Hoover Duros is 5 times less expensive) - I will recommend this little monkey to others, but just check count the tools, the main power head and check the packing, as soon as you receive the shipment.

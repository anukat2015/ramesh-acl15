Title: Not so great
Content:
This computer has the problems of battery life, and a weird screen look, which have been mentioned and explained elsewhere. 
Pros: The color depth on the screen is nice. The size and form are great. The overall features are good. Wifi and bluetooth work well.
Cons: None of this stuff works like it is supposed to. The fingerprint reader software is clunky and slow. Vista is garbage. The computer runs incredibly slow, and hot. The machine is incredibly prone to crashing. It might not give you a blue screen, but expect programs to crash consistently. Tech support will dissapoint you.
I bought this because it was cheap and full of features. It fit my size/price factors for a school laptop. With the dual core processor and 2GB ram I thought i'd get the bonus of a powerful machine too. I was wrong this thing is slooooooowwwww.
My 5yrs old dell with a p4 and 512mb ram will do more than this thing will. It also performed better than this computer in 3Dmark testing.

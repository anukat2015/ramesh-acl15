Title: Nice little heater
Content:
I've been using this Lasko 754200 in my home office (about 10 X 12) for a month and it easily heats the room quickly. I only use the low setting to save on power. The fan is a bit noisy but I'm (generally) not sleeping in my office. For the price, I would recommend it.

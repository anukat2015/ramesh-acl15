Title: Great Little Heater
Content:
This is a great product. I have now had it for about a month. It heats up right where you need it. (I would not recommend this heater for extremely large areas, as it is small, but it works great in my approx. 600 ft. living, dining and kitchen area.) It will heat up the space in less than 30 minutes-at 38 degree outside temp), has several temperature levels-60-85 degree F to choose from, and also osculates. It also has a 1,2,and 4 hour setting if you want it on for only short periods of time. I have used it in my bedroom with the door shut, 10 minutes tops for ultimate comfort!! Have not turned on electric heat so far and it is the end of November!!
The thing I like most, is that the outside of the heater(the casing) does not get hot. You can have it in one room, unplug and take to another, and the outside does not get hot or even warm-just the air vent. 
It is also very stylish. I have had several people comment on how great it looks--they would have never known the purpose without explanation. 
Had small children over for dinner the other night, and went without a hitch. Of course, don't leave small children alone in a room with it. It is supposed to turn of if knocked over, but has not been an issue.

Title: Great  Heater
Content:
I have owned the Big Buddy Heater for a couple years now and must say it is one of the best cold weather items I have found. The heater can be operated with (2) 1lb. cylinders or a 20 # refillable cylinder,hose and the recommended fuel filter. ( Recently, I found out there is another even better hose to use with a refillable cylinder) The hose F271803 and you don't even need a fuel filter!! The heater has a small fan that circulates the warm air and runs on D batteries or 115 volt adapter. 
I talk to a lot of RV owners and they swear by the heater.

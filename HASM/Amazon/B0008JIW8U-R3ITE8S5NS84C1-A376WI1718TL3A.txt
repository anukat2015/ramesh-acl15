Title: they ain't kidding about the PAUSE feature
Content:
Sometimes the time/display/control panel flashes if any coffee gets on the warming plate (by itself while brewing) in which the coffee then stops midway. The time flashes in which the coffee maker flashes on and off. You either have to wipe it off and wait or unplug it and wait. REAL PAIN when you need your coffee on the go. Other wise it's good and the time does lose some time too (from it flashing).

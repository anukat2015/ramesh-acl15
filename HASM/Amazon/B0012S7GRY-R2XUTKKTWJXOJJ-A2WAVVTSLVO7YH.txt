Title: Stopped Working
Content:
Stopped working after two weeks. I suppose in the time we had it it worked as would be expected. We snet it back where the Apple people say it worked fine for them, they could not duplicate the problem. We'll see, I am not holding out much hope that it will work more that a few more weeks. Kind of frustrating when you spend more than $100 you expect a little better reliability.

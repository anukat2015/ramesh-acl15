Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Model 3920
Content:
I've had a Pet Hair Eraser for almost a year. I'm still waiting to like it. Unfortunately, every time I turn it on, I hate it a little more. I like the onboard tools and the see-thru dust cup. I wish I could say more positive things but I just can't think of anything else. And I could go on about what I don't like - and as I just got done wrestling with the dumb thing I will list some: 
One of my biggest beefs is it's pick up ability. I'm sure it must have some but between the inconsistently spinning beater brush (regardless of rug setting)and the glorified lint brush attached to the front that smears the pet hair around more than it picks it up.
That lint brush also prevents vacuuming close to baseboards and such.
It's heavy, I could deal with that but the machine is also very poorly balanced so it doesn't take much to tip it over. Especially an issue if your stretching the hose to vacuum the stairs. There's more, I'll spare you...This Bissell is soon headed for the curb...

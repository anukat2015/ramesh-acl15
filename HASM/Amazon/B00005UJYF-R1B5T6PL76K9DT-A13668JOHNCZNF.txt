Title: Good value used.
Content:
My company bought the Latitude CpX for $2700 in 2000. It has a PIII 650mhz, 12g HD, 256k ram, with a docking station. The company gave it to me when our location was downsized in 2002. It is now 2008 and I have used it for business ever since and it is a tank.  Parts replaced include the keyboard ($20/ part) twice, battery ($30) once, and fan ($20/ part) once. Other than that it runs and runs. Still using Windows 2000 and now I have a Wifi card. I travel throughout the country and it runs great. Sure compared to today's units, it takes longer to boot up and shut down but I can't complain. I am now looking for a used, faster, Dell D610 only because my Outlook file has grown so large (400mb) and my HD is now about 90% full, it takes longer and longer to boot up. Once I delete 8 gigs of my work files off the unit it will be fine. This unit is now going to my son for school.

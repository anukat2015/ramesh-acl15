Title: Heater with Safety Features
Content:
This is a very good heater.  The fan puts out a lot of heat.  The indicators that turn red on the front of the heater are a great safety plus so that you know when the heater has cooled off.  Also, the turn off feature for when the heater is tipped over is a requirement where I work and this one works great.

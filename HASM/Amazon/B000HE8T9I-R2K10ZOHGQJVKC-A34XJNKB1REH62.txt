Title: Great alternative to Dyson
Content:
This is a great option if you are interested in the Dyson but don't want to spend $400-$500. It has great suction and really doesn't lose it with use. 
I like that the filter can be washed and reused. I was a bit shocked at how much dirt it picked up after first using my old (5 year old) vacuum.  
My main complaint is that the dust bin is a bit small. It is full after I vacuum my 1600 sq ft house. I do have a cat however and he does shed a great deal. The plastic could be a bit better quality. I'll be interested to see how well it holds up after a few years. 
I've had it for about 2 months and it works great. You can't beat it for the price.

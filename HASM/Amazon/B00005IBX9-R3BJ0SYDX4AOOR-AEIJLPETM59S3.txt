Title: Cuisinart DCC-1200
Content:
This is the second Cuisinart coffee maker I have purchased. The first was the "Grind & Brew" and it did a ok job, but the DCC-1200 is very good. Very easy to operate, clean and just makes the best coffee I have had in a home brew machine. You can not go wrong with this model.

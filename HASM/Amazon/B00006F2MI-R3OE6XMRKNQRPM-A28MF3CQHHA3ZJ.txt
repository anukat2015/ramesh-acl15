Title: GOOD COFFEE, BAD DESIGN
Content:
This makes really good coffee, but cleaning the grinder is a major pain.  You also need to clean the lid to the filter every time and it makes a mess taking it off and on. You can not fit your hand inside the carafe to clean it, so I'm reduced to using a sponge and a pair of tongs to get inside.  We've had this for a little over a year and the grinder is no longer working properly.  It leaves half the ground beans inside so I have to turn off the coffee maker, pull out the grinder and empty the grounds into the filter...put everything back and then turn it back on to brew.

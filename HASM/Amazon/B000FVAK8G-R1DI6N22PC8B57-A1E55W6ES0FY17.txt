Title: Unit is leaking oil on my carpet! Not what I expected at all.
Content:
Like many others here, I purchased this at Target on sale.  I have not been happy with the Honeywell HZ-709 7 Fin Oil Filled Radiator Heater at all.
First off, when you turn it on it makes a lot of dripping and crackling sounds as the oil heats up. I used it in an office so that didn't matter to me, but it might matter to you. 
Second, it was not consistent in keeping the room a comfortable temperature. Sometimes a setting of 70 would be very warm and other times it would be cold. 
Third, it kept blowing the "breaker" in my surge protector. It didn't blow the circuit breaker, just the surge protector. When this would happen, I would come in to a cold office and have to reset the surge protector and wait for it to heat the room back up again. 
Fourth, it takes a long time to heat a room with this type of heater. 
Fifth - and the final straw. It has started leaking oil, on my carpet. Great. I have put a thick piece of cardboard under it and am going to buy a ceramic or quartz heater tomorrow.

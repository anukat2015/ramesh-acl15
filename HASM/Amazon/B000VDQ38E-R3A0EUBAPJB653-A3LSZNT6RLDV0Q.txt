Title: This vacuum has been very very good to me!
Content:
I bought this vacuum a couple months ago and have been using it for general regular cleaning since then. I have been very impressed, but today I found out that it is WONDERFUL! 
Due to family scheduling I had to do Easter celebrations with my two children a day early. On a creative whim, I decided to scatter an ENTIRE BAG of Easter grass all over the floor leading to their baskets (Because the Easter Bunny is SO MESSY). Later, I pulled out this vacuum, and it completely cleaned up the entire mess. Except for having to empty the dirt cup a couple times (which is extremely easy to do) because of the bulk of the grass, this vacuum had no problem at all getting the job done. AMAZING!
I see a lot of people complaining that this vacuum is somewhat heavy. They are probably carrying it by the handle. Underneath the handle, where some of the tools are kept, there is an upside-down U-shaped area. If you pick it up gripping this area it becomes significantly lighter. 
In short, BUY THIS VACUUM!

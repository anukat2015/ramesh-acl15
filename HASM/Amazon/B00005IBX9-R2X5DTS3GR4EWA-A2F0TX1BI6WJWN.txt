Title: THE BEST COFFEE MAKER - EVER
Content:
Folks, after owning around 20 coffee makers over the years, this one is absolutely the best one you can buy.  Yes, like the other reviews, I find the coffee to taste more clean, crisp, and flavorful.  I like my coffee, but have also tried Maxwell House and Folgers (obviously not the most gourmet brands) and even these taste better with this coffee maker.  It is very easy to understand and operate, and with my stainless steel and black appliances this model looks great in my kitchen.  Here is another point not frequently described in other reviews - I keep it under my tall kitchen cabinets, so I must pull it out to open the lid and fill the basin with water.  This is THE FIRST one that does not easily spill as I push it back into place under the cabinet because the water level (even for 12 cups) is several inches below the top of the coffee maker.  I very highly recommend purchasing this model - you will not be disappointed.  Oh, and one more thing, another person wrote the water level is hard to determine, but I must ask "didn't you actually look at the coffee pot you were filling to a certain line before you emptied the same amount of water into your coffee maker?"  The water level is very easy to determine - because there is a very visible level indicator inside the maker itself.  Buy it.

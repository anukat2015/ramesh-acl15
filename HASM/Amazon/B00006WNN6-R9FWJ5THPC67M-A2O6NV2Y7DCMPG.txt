Title: Great little fan for a cold office
Content:
Super fan. I ordered it a year ago, and its still going strong. I use it almost everyday. 
I like the auto shut off feature if I drop it. 
The thermostat is great. 
I drop it all the time and it rolls around the floor, spill coffee on it, and it still works. 
Great little fan, you won't be disappointed.

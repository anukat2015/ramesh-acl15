Title: Great little netbook!
Content:
I have had this netbook for about a month.  It's the perfect size for me.  The 10" netbooks are just a little too small so I opted for the 11.6".  This is a great size as you can take it anywhere but it's not heavy or bulky like other laptops.  The screen is bright and clear.  It doesn't get hot on your lap.  The only disappointment is the keyboard.  The shift and enter key on the right is a little bit of a stretch.  I am a very fast typist but on this keyboard I constantly make typo's since the keys are flat and your fingers tend to slide off at times and hit an incorrect key. I type all day at work without a problem and then come home to this keyboard and make many mistakes.  If you use this constantly I guess you would get used to it.  I mostly use it to surf the web, check my email and comparison shop online.  I would still recommend it.  It has Windows 7 and lots of other goodies for a good price.

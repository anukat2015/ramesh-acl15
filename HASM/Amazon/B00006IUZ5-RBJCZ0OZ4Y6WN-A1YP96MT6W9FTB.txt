Title: Nice Update
Content:
We've owned a much earlier (maybe early '90s) version of the Sunbeam Hot Shot, and it has served us well.  In fact, the old machine still works; we just wanted to get a new one.  Apparently, there were some problems with people accidentally turning the old models on with no water in them.  The current model avoids that problem.  It's just as fast at heating up water than the classic model, if not faster, and the opening into which you pour the cold water is more conveniently shaped and sized.  Curiously, we've looked for these at several stores at which we were sure we'd find one.  No luck, though...  Just out of curiosity I did an amazon.com search and found that several affiliates had several different versions of the Hot Shot available, in stock, and ready for shipping.  We received ours within a few days after placing an order and could not be happier with the product or the service.

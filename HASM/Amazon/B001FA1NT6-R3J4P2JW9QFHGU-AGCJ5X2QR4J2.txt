Title: Apple's greatest iPod for the runner
Content:
I'm not alone in saying that I like to have music playing while I'm on the treadmill or working out in the gym.  And carrying my iPod has always been the best way to take my music with me.  The 2nd generation shuffle remains the best iPod for the active iTunes listener.  In this case, the iPod generation that follows is not a great improvement over the previous ones.  Customers have complained that the controls will short out when sweat drips on it.  Additionally, I find it MORE convienient to have a docking station rather than a USB port.  Keep in mind that connecting via USB port would also make the unit much bigger.
As for ease of use, if you're an iTunes user, it's extremely easy.  You can pick random songs or a specific playlist to fill your shuffle.  With up to 2gb of space, it's more than enough to give you a variety of songs.  
Just clip this puppy onto your sleeve and turn it on.  This is the best workout iPod.

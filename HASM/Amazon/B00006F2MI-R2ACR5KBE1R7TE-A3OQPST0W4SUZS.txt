Title: I love it no matter what others say
Content:
I've been very surprised to read all the negative reviews. I've used this coffee machine for 2 weeks now and I love it. The coffee is wonderful and I don't mind a little extra clean up. It's not like it's difficult to take apart, and all you have to do is rinse and let a few of the parts dry. It's not exactly brain surgery. I suppose the lid does pour slowly, but I haven't really recognized this as a problem. I'd prefer it pouring slowly to splashing out and spilling everywhere. Some of the reviews make it sound like it seriously slows things down but I haven't noticed this at all. You might be waiting an extra 2 or 3 seconds I suppose, but not enough to make a difference to me. I also haven't noticed a huge difference in the temp of the coffee if I don't run some hot water in the carafe first. It comes out very hot. Granted, I have never owned an expensive coffee machine so maybe the difference in one and the Cuisinart is noticeable to someone that has.  Don't let the negative reviews scare you off, I love this coffee maker!

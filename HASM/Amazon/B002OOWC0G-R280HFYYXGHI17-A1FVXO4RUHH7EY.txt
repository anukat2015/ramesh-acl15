Title: Really like this little guy
Content:
Just received it yesterday. Was the quickest easiest setup I've ever had to do. 
Even on the first full charge and nearly constant use. I can;t wear it out. I haven't stopped playing on it except to sleep. It's fast, light, powerful and good looking. I upgraded another (larger) laptop with Win 7 Home. I liked it a lot. This one with the factory loaded version. I like even better. 
This just may have my favorite keyboard ever. The whole thing is just great. Well, with one exception. But then I already knew about it. The sound. I sure wish they had put it on top instead of underneath. Not a real problem for me. I prefer using headphones anyhow. I like the built in mouse pad. But again prefer my wireless mouse. 
I just didn't think those two little things were enough to knock a star off. I also knew there wasn't an optical drive. I've got a USB cd/dvd hard drive so that's not an issue either. Wasn't sure if I would really like the white. I do though. It's not milk white and the pattern I find interesting. 
Especially appreciated there not being a ton of software to remove. That hasn't been the case with any other computer I've owned. Gotta stop rambling here. Oh, the screen is great too. I tied the eco mode. Didn't hate it but am using equal setting and still get plenty of battery time. 
Update: I went to the Toshiba website to see if there were any driver updates. There were several. One was for sound. I downloaded and installed it. It's made a considerable difference in the volume of my speakers. Still lovin' this little guy. Using it more than my 17.3" laptop.

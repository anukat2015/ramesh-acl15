Title: Perfect little device
Content:
I own an 80gb Zune and while visiting my family recently, my now 9 year old niece said she wanted to listen to music on it. So, I let her listen for a while and she didn't want to give it back!! She said that one of her uncles had an iPod, but she liked my Zune better. I asked her why and she said she liked the way the screen looked. Go figure. lol 
So, I told her she had to give me daggone Zune back, but that I would get her one for her birthday. I had gotten my sister, whose in college, the 8gb zune for her birthday earlier in the year and it's much smaller than my 80gb zune.  So, I asked her if she had it in her handbag and she said yes. I told her to let my niece see it so she could let me know whether she wanted the big one or the small one.  As I figured, she said she wanted the small one. When her birthday rolled around, I started researching prices and Amazon had the best price, so I bought it from here and I'm so glad I did.  She loves it and I got it for a great price. What could be better?!
I recommend that anyone get a Zune if you are trying to decide between an iPod and a Zune. It's easier to use and with the Zune Pass, it's a no brainer. Unlimited downloads that stay on your device for as long as you pay the subscription fee every month, and 10 songs to keep? Come on. It's a no brainer.  I got the device that lets me listen to it in my car for $10 at [...] back in May and I'm in heaven. I would never buy an iPod, especially considering they don't have anything similar to the Zune Pass. I don't have to worry about whether the FBI is going to knock down my door because I'm stealing music.

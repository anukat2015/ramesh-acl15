Title: Great camera.
Content:
I had the D70 and never thought I would need to upgrade soon since it did almost everything I want it to.  Well, that is, until Nikon introduced cameras with more points of focus, since I hated having to recompose after I've focused due to the limited areas of focus on the D70.  I hesitated on making a purchase until someone offered to buy my camera as soon I mentioned that I wanted to upgrade.  I'm glad I got the D90.  It's very much like the D70 but new and improved.  The LCD is much bigger.  And the zoom ability is so much better.  More points of focus of course.  It does great with higher ISO settings than the D70.  I like how the D70 feels in my hands and the D90 is the same.  So yes, it's a great camera for me.

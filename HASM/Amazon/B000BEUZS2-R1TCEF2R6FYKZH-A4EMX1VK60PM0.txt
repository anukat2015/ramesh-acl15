Title: Best Buy
Content:
I gave it 5 star simply because of the price and features to me are unbeatable. I think I spent like $26 shipping included. It is very very small, so when I got package I did not think it could be a heater. My heatpump went out, so had to get these for this winter at 9 degrees right now!
Pros:  Pumps alot of heat for area! With ceiling fan, keeps it even more toasty. Love the safety tipover feature. I suspect it will use less power because when you turn the knob on left, it still pumps out good heat, even on low.
Cons:  Makes alittle more noise than those cheap Box Fans, but for the price and my need for heat, I will make do.

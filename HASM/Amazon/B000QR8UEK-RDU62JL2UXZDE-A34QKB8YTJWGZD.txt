Title: Works well
Content:
Am very happy with the heaters.  I bought two in an effort to limit electric furnice from running and these did the trick.  In my mind the cost of periodically running these versus the big heating elements and fan in the furnice will save money.
I have not had to run the furnice since my purchase and time will tell if they are cost efficient.
They are small and easy to move as they do have a handle type grip.
Would recommend.

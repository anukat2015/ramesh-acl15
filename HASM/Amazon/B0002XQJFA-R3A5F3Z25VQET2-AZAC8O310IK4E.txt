Title: Great SLR
Content:
Basically the 2 biggest SLR manufacturers in this category are Nikon and Canon.  While both are great cameras, I ultimately chose the Canon because of the a wider array of lenses.  I found that reading camera reviews on Amazon were not as useful looking at sites that were dedicated to digital photography.

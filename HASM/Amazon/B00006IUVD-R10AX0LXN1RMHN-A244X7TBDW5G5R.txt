Title: poorly made, poorly designed
Content:
Since it was new the switch never worked correctly.  I had to pull the plug after each use. Now it has stopped working. I forgot and left it plugged in and that must have overheated some thermostat or some other control. Also poorly designed. Grinds constantly get into the water tank. Also pouring the water in was designed for left-handed people. The tank opening is on the left side and it difficult to do with your right hand. Not recommended.

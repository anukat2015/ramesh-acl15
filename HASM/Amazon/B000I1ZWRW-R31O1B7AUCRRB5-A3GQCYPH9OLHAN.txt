Title: Now that ive used it...
Content:
Ok so I have now been using the rebel xti for a few months, and shot hundreds and hundreds perhaps thousands of pictures. Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to! The AF is way faster and quieter, the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports, the body feels great (maybe not for small hands) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f/4L. I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it. I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera, however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras. Plus the shutter on the 30D sounds way better. lol.

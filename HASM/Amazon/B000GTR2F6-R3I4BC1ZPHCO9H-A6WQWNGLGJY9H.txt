Title: Keurig B70
Content:
Love this machine!!
I've had a Senseo for years, bought it after a trip to Holland where every family member owned one. We were able to by all sorts of teas and coffees while in Holland to go with it. After coming home I found those same things were not available in the US. It got very expensive having family send it. 
The Keurig is extremely quite in comparison the Senseo. The variety of K cups is amazing. We're big tea drinking and love all the different options.
I love the fact I can choose from 5 different size cups.
Also the programmable timer is a blessing, no waiting for it to heat up in the morning, I get up and it's ready to brew!!

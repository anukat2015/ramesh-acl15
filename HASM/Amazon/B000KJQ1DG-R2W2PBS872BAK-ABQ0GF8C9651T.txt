Title: Perfect Camera For DSLR Beginners!
Content:
Just last week I received my Nikon D40 (I got it super fast thanks to Amazon Prime) and I couldn't be more excited/happy/inspired/creative and many more similar descriptive words.
Nikon has obviously done an excellent job hitting their target market for this camera (someone like me, who wanted to jump the bridge from point and shoot to DSLR), and we should be thankful that we can pick up a camera of this kind of quality for such a fair price (under $500). 
The kit lens that accompanied the camera has already delivered some phenomenal shots, and I'm pretty pumped up and excited about using it for family photos for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Finally, someone in my family (me) will be able to share respectable and hopefully jaw dropping shots that capture the feel of the holidays more than a point and shoot camera can. 
No need to get too technical here. It's simple. If you're looking for the best quality DSLR camera at the best price, this is it. Don't hesitate, just get it. Read the other 100+ 5 star reviews if you want, but they all say the same thing - this camera ROCKS!

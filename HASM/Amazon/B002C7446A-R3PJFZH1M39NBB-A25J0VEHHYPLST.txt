Title: MacBook Pro is a BEAST!!!!!
Content:
I JUST RECIEVED MY MBP AND I LOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!! I HAD A DELL E1405 AND IT COULD NOT HOLD ALL OF MY MUSIC, PHOTOS, AND OTHER THINGS ON IT AND IT CRASHED IT ALSO HAD A VIRUS AS WELL!!! YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT WITH THIS...MACS ARE THE BEST THE PICTURE ON THE SCREEN IS VIVID AND CLEAR, THE ALUMINUM IS ADDED PROTECTION AS WELL. I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY AND EVERYONE WHO WANTS A LAPTOP...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON WINDOWS...THIS IS A GREAT INVESTMENT..ITS VERY EASY TO USE AND SET UP WAS A BREEZE..I GOT THE PRO OVER THE REGULAR MACBOOK BECAUSE I MAY NEED TO UPGRADE ON MY GB AND THIS THING HOLD 8!!! ALTHOUGH I DID NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IT STILL ROCKS!! I BOUGHT IT FROM [...] (REFURBED) AND IT LOOKED BRAND NEW WHEN I OPENED THE BOX...DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS MACBOOK PRO!

Title: Very nice room heater.
Content:
I bought this unit to heat a bedroom thats over my garage. It gets very cold during the long Minnesota winters. The room is 12 x 13, and this heater does a very good job at keeping this room cozy. I have it on the low setting and keep the thermostat at around 3. I also keep the door closed on this room. The thermostat settings range from 1-5 and only regulate the amount of time the heater is on. It dosen't guage the room temperature and turn the unit on and off to maintain a specified temperature.
This unit is also very light, which is another reason I bought it. I also like how it looks.

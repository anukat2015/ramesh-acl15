Title: Great Camera!
Content:
Well there is so much written about the 20D who could add to that? I will say that the battery life is truely amazing! 
The only real big drawback I have found to the camera is the Battery compartment door.... The catch is to flimsy for my taste. I somehow managed to break the tiny (and I mean tiny) catch on the compartment door. I still dont know how it broke since I have babied this thing since I bought it three months ago but alas it broke. Anyway Cannon would not replace the derned thing under warranty so there goes $15 for a new door with catch. 
Besides that this is a awesome camera.

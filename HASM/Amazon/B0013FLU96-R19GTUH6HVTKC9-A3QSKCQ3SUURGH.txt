Title: Great New Computer
Content:
I've been a Mac user for over 7 years and am on my fourth computer, and by far, this one is my favorite!
This MacBook Pro is the most balanced one they've come out with, and it has all of the most up-to-date features including these key ones:
1. Runs cooler than my friends' previous version MBP
2. Mulit-touch is nice but I don't use it a lot
3. Upgraded iSight camera makes for great video chatting and works perfectly with many other programs. I use it almost daily for video journaling
4. LED screen isn't "new" for this model, but it is a great feature that makes the screen look wonderful
5. More storage on the entry-level model than before
All in all, I'm very satisfied with this computer and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid laptop that has speed but isn't huge. Also, the size difference compared to the MacBook is minimal in my opinion. Sometimes this actually seems smaller given the sleeker design. 
Of course, the only drawback is the price, but over the life of the computer, I think it will be well worth it. Finally, it is a Mac and it has the best operating system available (Mac OS 10.5) whether you're a newbie or computer aficionado!

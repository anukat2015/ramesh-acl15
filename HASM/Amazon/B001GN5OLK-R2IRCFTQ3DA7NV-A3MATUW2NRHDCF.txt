Title: Terrible, Terrible, Terrible Computer
Content:
I have owned this computer (the exact one for sale) for about six months now and I use it everyday for class.  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A WORSE COMPUTER.  It is the least responsive computer I have ever owned.  It is true that it rarely freezes but it is forever h...hes...hesi...hesitating.  The touch-pad decides when it does and doesn't want to work, which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating.  Sometimes it will just decide that it wants to turn off, and it does, without warning.  Finally, it cannot understand how to find and maintain an internet connection.  I have an old powerbook (mac) that can find and connect to wireless twice as fast as this brand new laptop, that comes pretty highly rated.  I run Vista business (required at my law school) so maybe that is part of it, but it certainly can't be all of it.  Just thought I should put in my 2 cents since all these ratings are so high, figured I would let people know there is certainly another side.

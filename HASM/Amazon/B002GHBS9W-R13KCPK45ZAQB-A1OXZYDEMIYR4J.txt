Title: Worst ever!
Content:
This coffeemaker is the worst thing I've ever purchased, ever. The lid design sucks, the carafe is garbage, and it's impossible to make a reasonably strong full pot of coffee.  When my father visits he likes to get up early and make what I call mud by grinding the beans to near espresso fineness and then literally packing them into the filter and even that didn't produce a moderately strong pot.  So if you don't like your coffee as weak as a newborn child and don't feel like using $10 worth of coffee to make a half a pot I suggest you look elsewhere.

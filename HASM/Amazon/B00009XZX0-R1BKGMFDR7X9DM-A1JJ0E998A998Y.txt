Title: Its really a small Desktop Computer
Content:
This computer really does have it all.  Its quick, has plenty of extra's and has a great screen.  Sure its heavy, and the battery life is not great, but if your looking at THIS kind of power, those factors don;t matter.  Your more likely to have this plugged in the wall and not on the go anyway. Its really a small desktop: 2.8P,(with 800mhz bus) 512MB RAM, 32MB Video RAM, DVD-R/RW, 17 inch screen, and a  pretty good software package!!!!  On paper, it matches or BEATS many of today desktops.  And on top of it all, you can have it for under 2 grand.  I've owned it for 5 weeks now, and its been running great.  The built in Wi-Fi is great too, because if you manage to take it somewhere where there is wireless internet, its ready to jump on. The Screen is without a doubt, the greatest feature.  You can see everything, and watching DVD movies are really fun. Its like you have a  portable desktop with a 17" widescreen that you can carry with you if you had to.  The battery lasts about 1 hour and a half, depending on how heavy you use it, but like I said, power like this comes with a price. Great for digital pictures, great for home movies, although the hard drive is a bit small, I suggest buying the opitional 2nd hard drvie for the unit.  Great for a first time buyer, or the professional.

Title: Zune is a Winner!
Content:
I've owned my Zune 80gb since January now with zero problems.  Simply LOVE it!  For those of you contemplating buying a Zune over an iPod, I strongly recommend going Zune.  Need some reasons?
- The tactile touch control is lightyears ahead of iPod's click wheel.
- Zune delivers great sound, and is also more concerned about preserving your hearing (Zunes are not as loud as iPods)
- Built-in FM radio works perfectly even in relatively unpopulated areas.
- Zune Pass service allows unlimited music downloads (DRM'd of course) for $15 a month
- The Zune Social website allows you to share your musical tastes with others.
The only thing that may cause some dissatisfaction is the Zune Software, which is required to sync content to the Zune.  I'm not going to lie, the software could use some work.  It can be a bit buggy & frustrating to use at first, but once you figure out it's quirks, you'll be smooth sailing.
Microsoft may have made mistakes in the past, but Zune is not one of them!

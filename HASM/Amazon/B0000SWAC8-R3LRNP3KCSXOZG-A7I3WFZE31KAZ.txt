Title: CR let me down
Content:
My wife and I purchased this unit after conducting research, including the Consumer Reports website. Although after a few uses it does seem to function well, it is extremely hard to control. The head swivels in only one direction, making it very difficult to push the brush head in the other direction. Even when pushing it straight it feels like it wants to turn into the direction of the swivel. I am a fairly strong guy and yet I have to fight with it. It's awkward to maneuver around furniture or table legs.
On the positive side, it is quiet and it seems to work quite well. The cord retraction is fast and reliable. Thus far we have not had a single issue with it. With a properly swiveling brush, this would turn into a 5 star review.

Title: 5 Stars out of 5 for good coffee, but it's a bit quirky
Content:
I just got this and must say it does the job ( hence the 5 of 5)  of delivering the hot water to the coffee and brewing very good coffee, but it has  quirks  I'm not appreciating in  my morning coffee brewing routine.  First after its finished brewing there is still 1/2 cup of water in the "plumbing" which requires you to tip the pot over and empty very hot water out, other wise  you'll be starting with stale water and perhaps accelerating the scaling, 
second the foot plate does not "lock in" as they say so when you lift the pot to move it( or empty it)  it does fall off , 
third to my dismay the thermal jug will require a brush to keep clean as the mouth is too narrow to get your hand in there to scrub( this is also a VERY  BIG  problem with my Capresso thermal), 
fourth since the top of the thermal jug does not fitback in under the coffee basket when its on the  jug I'm tryig to figure out where to keep everything so not to use up extra  counter space nor lose the top 
Fifth as  I  slide it  around on the counter top( out to be used and back  in  when not) the feet are leaving some marks ( which come up with cleaning) on the granite countertop. 
and last it seems for few dollars more they could have included a circuit to turn it self off when its done brewing, rather than leaving it to the early morning harried coffee drinker to remember  to  switch it off.   So yes very good coffee, but  the quirks are on par with the ones you deal with with a french press ( which is much cheaper)

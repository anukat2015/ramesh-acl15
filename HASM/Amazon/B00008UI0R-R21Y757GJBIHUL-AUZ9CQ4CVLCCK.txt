Title: Forget about Customer Service
Content:
I purchased the Hoover S3765-040 about a month ago from Amazon.
Immediately the electronic control on the handle started going out.
Forget about calling Hoover - they recently sold out- so no one will answer their 800 Number. After a afternoon of calls I finally found a dealer here in Dallas who says they can fix it.
Too bad if you're use to having a company pick up the damaged and deliver a new.
It may be a good product, when it finally works, but my suggestion is to spend a little more for a company who has a concept of Customer Service.

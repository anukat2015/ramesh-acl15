I think with a unit like this one it is important to bear in mind how cheap it is.  This is a very cheap and utilitarian unit.  However, having said that it does what you expect a small electric heater to do.
The temperature gauge works pretty well and will keep a small room at a constant temperature pretty well.  The cord is also significantly longer than my Holmes unit (though it lacks the pivot feature of the Holmes).

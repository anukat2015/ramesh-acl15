Title: You will never regret buying this camera!
Content:
Still figuring out all the specs and how to utilize all the sweet manual settings but other than that it takes amazing pictures!  Great overall camera.  Canon all the way! 
Also, if you are going to buy it, get it without the kit lens and get something better, you will not regret it. I have a friend that has the kit lens on a different rebel model and I played around with it and the quality and overall specs are not that great.  I purchased the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens, well worth the extra investment.

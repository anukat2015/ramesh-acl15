Title: just what we needed
Content:
These are small and light, and they don't use up too much power.  They heat up a room in minutes and keep it nice and toasty.  A very good purchase; I bought two and will be making good use of them all winter long.  Nice to have a "fan only" option as well, which will come in handy later on.  Great for the price!

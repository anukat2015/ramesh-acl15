Title: Good for price, but a few drawbacks
Content:
I purchased this spaceheater for an elderly relative as a birthday gift. I selected it for the tempature settings, hoping that it would turn itself off and on through the night. Unfortunately, I have ended up giving my year old spaceheater as the gifted one instead, due to a few problems with this one. The first is that it continues to run if knocked over. My old spaceheater immediately shuts itself off if tipped over, but this one kept going. The second is the button system can be annoying, and would be difficult for someone with poor eyesight to understand as trying to turn it off I often end up changing the tempature in the process as well, which means a lot of button clicking to get back to the prior one. The tempature settings which caused me to pick this one don't work so well. The heater shuts off quickly when I use them. All of that said, however, the heater does a very good job of heating quickly if you simply ignore all the not-so functional features and use the High tempature. Low tempature is very noisy, this doesn't happen on High though. All and all, good little heater for a basic job, just don't expect too much out of the bells and whistles.

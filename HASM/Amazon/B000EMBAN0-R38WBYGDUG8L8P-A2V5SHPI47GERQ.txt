Title: Great Vaccum
Content:
This vaccum has been great. as many others have said, it works very well for pet hair. My dog sheds constantly and when I vaccum my 2 bedroom condo, I have to empty the canister twice because it picks up so much hair. The hepa filter works great, you just have to remember to remove it if you use any powders like carpet fresh because it will ruin the filter.
I don't know how people can compare this vaccum to the Dyson, the Dyson is twice as expensive, of course it will be better...that's like comparing a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. For the money, this is a GREAT vaccum cleaner.

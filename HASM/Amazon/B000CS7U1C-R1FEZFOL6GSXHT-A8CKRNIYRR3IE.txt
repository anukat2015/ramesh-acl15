Title: AMAZING!!!
Content:
I just loved this mp3 player, a lot of my friends have video ipods and they just kept on saying that the zen vision is way cooler.
-The battery last longer than the ipod video, thats why its a bit chubbier but is not that much
-The zen vision includes a RESET button at the bottom and in case your mp3 freezes u just press it and you dont lose any of your music,not like the ipod that u press menu + play but u lose all of the data.
-The audio quality is way better
-The radio function gives it a special twist
-It already comes with the wall charger!!!
-U dont need any iTunes special software to insert music, you can use windows media player to add music to your mp3
-The only problems I have noticed is that the earphones actually dont fit your ears, so theyre constantly falling off, and the fact that is necessary to have the port with you cause u cant plug the mp3 directly to pc or electric connection, you have to plug it to the adapter first and then to mp3, but those arent really big reasons for not buying this product

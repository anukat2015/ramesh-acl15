Title: Nice appliance
Content:
I just recently purchased this machine the day after my 3 month old Mr. Coffee stopped working.  It's great and makes wonderful coffee.
I am giving it one less star than it might rightfully deserve due to a minor inconvenience.
I did not see any mention of the machine's automatic alarm system in the product description. Whether that is considered a "pro" or "con" is up to the owner.  It sounds a rather loud succession of beeps when the coffee is done brewing and again when the automatic shutoff is engaged.   I'd personally rather that feature could be disabled so the machine does not wake the entire household. It does sound like an alarm clock and I hear it easily throughout the house, even upstairs. It's there if someone considers that a convenient feature.

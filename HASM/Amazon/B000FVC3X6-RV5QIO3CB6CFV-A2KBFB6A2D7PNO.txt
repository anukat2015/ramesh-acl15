Title: Excellent Little Heater!
Content:
The Honeywell HZ-370 GP Electronic Ceramic Heater is "just the right size" if you are looking for a compact heater with a stylish design. It can be used for both floor and table top. I especially like the modern, streamlined body of this heater.  There is a digital window which shows the room temperature, an energy saver button, a timer which can be set for 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours.  Also, the temperature can be set from 45 degrees to 80 degrees, and the heater will turn off when that temperature is reached; it will be displayed, and then blink. It will then turn back on when the temperature drops below the desired setting. There are two heat settings - 1500 watts on high, and 900 watts in the energy saver mode.
By pressing the button on the top, the heater will oscilliate.  There is a recessed handle on the top for convenience.  It is equipped with several saftety devices and has a tip-over switch that disables the heater if tipped over.  An Alert Heat Indicator Badge on the grille turns from black to red when hot.  A high temperature safety control prevents overheating, and a back-up thermal circuit breaker will shut down the heater if operated a higher than normal temperatures.  Also, the heater runs fairly quite for the amount of heat it puts out.
I was impressed with the many features of this heater and how efficiently it performs. It puts out ample heat for the size. If it came with a remote, it would have received 5 stars.  This is the only feature it lacks, and I would have preferred to be included.  Great little heater!

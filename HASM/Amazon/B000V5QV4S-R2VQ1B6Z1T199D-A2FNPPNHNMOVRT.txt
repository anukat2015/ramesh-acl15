Title: Well worth it
Content:
I finally upgraded my venerable original Digital Rebel to the 40D. While the 50D offers a few more bells and whistles, the value is clearly with the 40D. I just returned from a Southern Caribbean cruise where the camera got quite a workout. The battery life was excellent. The picture quality was excellent. The relative performance was outstanding. No complaints whatsoever.
I would stronly recommend this camera to anyone.

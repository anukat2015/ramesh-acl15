Title: Emits a bad smell
Content:
I've run the unit for 2 days straight and it still emits a really bad smell.  I even tried running it outside for several hours but whatever fumes are coming from the unit are making me sick.  The other reviews seem overly positive so maybe I just received a defective unit but I'm going to return this and try something else.
If the smell wasn't an issue this heater would be perfect.  The heat it puts out in great and the design is really nice too.

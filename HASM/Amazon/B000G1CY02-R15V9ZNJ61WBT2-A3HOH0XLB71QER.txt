Title: Fabulous...... // Edit: one year later

This heating unit is simply wonderful. We've had it for a week and like the other reviewers state, it is quiet,portable  and efficient.  I paid quite a bit more than the $60. it is being advertised for here on Amazon, and I don't care-- it's that good.
We bought it because I am always cold, especially at night, and our heating bill was just getting outrageous. Now, we can keep the thermostat lowered and I am  comfortable in whichever room I put the heater in. It heats the area up quickly eneough (maybe 20 minutes to its full warmth potential) and keeps the warmth maintained. Our cats have had no trouble with the heater and one of them seems to love it as much as I do. We are buying another one this week.
A note about the sticker problem: we were prepared, with hair dryer in hand, to do battle with the ugly blue sticker. It peeled right off with zero resistance. My theory is the company heard the complaints and corrected the problem.

I still love it. It works as good as always.  We have one on the wall in the bedroom and it is just fantastic.  I turn it on low when I start getting ready for bed, and by the time I finish getting ready, the bedroom is pleasantly warm. We have a second one in the  'study' room, and we couldn't be happier. I will never buy a different space heater, this is the one I will always pick.

Title: Nano needs materials rethink
Content:
I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device.  This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt.  The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected.  I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front.  Damned annoying.
Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it.  Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?
My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed.  You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you won't buy one.

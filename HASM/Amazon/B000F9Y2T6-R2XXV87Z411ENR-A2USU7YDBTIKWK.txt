Title: Good for small spaces
Content:
I was amazed that this mop picked up hair from my long haired dog with ease.  It was easy to flip from one side to the other.  You have to use the dry side before the wet side and not flip back and forth because the wet pad will make the dry items stick instead of being vacuumed up.  It was very difficult to push the vacuum when it was on the wet side. The cleaning fluid left the floors dull and some liquid was left behind.  I gave this item three stars because it works well on small spaces and allows you to clean up spills in a pinch.  I wouldn't recommend it for large spaces because pushing it becomes tiresome and the cleaning head is small.

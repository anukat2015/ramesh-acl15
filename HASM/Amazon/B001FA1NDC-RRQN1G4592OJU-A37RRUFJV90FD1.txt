Title: 3 Days to White Screen
Content:
After the first three days of use the display turned white. Everything is fully functional, yet not real good when you cannot view the screen. After shutdown it will power back up just fine. But as soon as you start to play it the screen goes white. Now I am in the process of trying to figure out what's wrong. Hope this doesn't happen to you! Aside from that it sounds great!!

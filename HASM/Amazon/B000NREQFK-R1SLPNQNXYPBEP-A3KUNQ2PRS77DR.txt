Title: Enjoying it throroughly!!
Content:
I have had my player for about a month now, I love it.  It takes about 6-8 seconds for it to turn on (not a minute as previously noted)and it plays quality sound.  I feel like you will be amazed at how well this player plays music, I know I was!  If you find it at a decent price (about $30-$35), I would go ahead and purchase one.  After all what have you got to loose.  The only problem I had with mine was initially getting the music on it, I had never owned a mp3 player before so I had to learn how it all worked, but if you follow the instructions carefully you shouldn't have a problem.

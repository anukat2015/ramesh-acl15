Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
This coffee maker is great as far as size is concerned, as there is only one person in our home that drinks coffee. You can get at least large 2 mugs of coffee. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The coffee pot is very leaky and makes a mess on the counter. We have been unable to find paper filters that fit. The worst part is, it brews very bitter and unflavorful coffee, regardless of whether you use the best quality coffee or not. 
This was a waste of money as after a few weeks of having this item, we have now ordered the 5 cup Zojirushi Zutto which brews great coffee, thanks to the cone filter and high quality construction.

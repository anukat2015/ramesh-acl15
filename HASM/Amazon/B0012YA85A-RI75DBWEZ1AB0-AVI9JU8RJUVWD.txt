Title: Great Camera & Software but bad manual
Content:
The camera is exceptional for the money.  The manual that comes with it is dry however and makes it hard to grasp the concepts of how and when to use specific functions.  In order to quickly learn how to use all that it had to offer, I bought a training video and I am very happy that I did as it saved a lot of time.  There are many out there but I can only speak to the one that I bought which was "Canon Rebel XSi DVD Training Guide Tutorial Lessons XTi".
The software that comes with the camera is excellent as well but again the instructions are sorely lacking.  [...].  There are a series of Canon sponsored videos that will guide you in using this powerful software.
Lens:  I have the 18mm-55mm and 55-250mm kit lens.  These work well.  I wanted to do portraits and closeups with a beautiful "bokeh" (which is Japanese for the blurring effect behind the subject due to a shallow depth of field).  For this, I also bought the Canon f1.4 50mm, which is my best lens.  
I also got the Canon 580EX II flash.  Again, poor instructions and confusing but just Google for help as there are only a few things that a beginner needs to know.  Get a "diffuser" with it as well to help control the shadows that it can cast.
If you want to use the "mirror lock" function on the camera you should also get a wireless/RF (not infrared-IR) remote.  Just be careful to make sure that it works with the "mirror lock" function as some do not.
So, if you like photography and are a serious amateur, you can't go wrong with the Canon xsi in my opinion.

Title: Great if it is what you need
Content:
So after reading through all the other reviews I have a few minor things to add or suggest. First, the touchpad is not that bad. I have had the laptop for 2 weeks and after a few minor tweeks to the touchpad settings, it works like a thing of beauty. multitouch is excellent. Just remember there is no need to put a lot of pressure when you are trying to use the multitouch. Once you find the right pressure it works great. You can also make the touchpad less sensitive so that when you are typing it doesn't mess you up as much. 
If you want something with tons of processing power look elsewhere. For me it is perfect but I am basically using it for internet, some video playback, and office. I will do some psing at some point i' m sure, and it should handle that just fine.
No internet issues. Update drivers when you get it.
Fingerprint magnet, but microfibers work great.
Thin. light, pretty.
cool and quiet
very nice overall value for the money. Best I've seen.

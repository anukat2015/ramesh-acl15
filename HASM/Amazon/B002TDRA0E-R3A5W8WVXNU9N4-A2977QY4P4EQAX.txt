Title: LOVE MY NEW MIELE
Content:
My husband and I have been shopping for a good vacuum because we have 2500 square feet of tile, wood and three low pile area rugs along with a 9 yr old son, two dogs and live in a sandy, woody area.  All of our family suffers from allergies and our son suffers with asthma so I was pleased about the filtration system that Miele offers.
I took my "dirty" area rug to my local Miele dealer which had about two weeks of dirt along with dog hair since our Hoover died.  We put the Miele Delphi to the test and it cleaned the rug beautifully!!!  I was instantly sold and brought the new Miele home.  I would've ordered online but I really needed to try it out in the store because of my dog's hair.
I have spent 2 hours vacuuming everything I can possibly vacuum!!!  The floors, ottoman, baseboards, lamp shades and I'm loving it.  It is hard to believe that someone can get so excited about a vacuum.  I gave the Delphi a 4 star rating only because I found it maneuvered a bit awkwardly over the power cord at times.  I think it would be great if they could design the powerhead to "lock" upright when you want to take a break rather than attaching it to the canister to "park" it.  Despite these two items I've mentioned, I am still extremely happy with my purchase.
I know I made the right decision on buying the Miele and look forward to years and years of cleaning.   My car is next.....after I recover from my marathon today!!!

Title: The Best Heater For The Money
Content:
I bought this thing two years ago and I love it.  It instantly puts out heat.  I have an office and the heat in it is horrible.  I can have my thermostat set to 70 but the temp stays at about 50-55 in this room.  55 is pretty much a average temp through out the winter but it has gotten lower at times.  I turn this heater on Eco mode and about 30 to 40 minutes later the temp is about 66 to 68.  On full throttle it takes about 20 minutes and gets as high as 75.  People might expect a instant change but it doesn't happen like that.  If you keep this thing set on Eco it doesn't effect your electric bill much at all, you can't even notice it, full throttle you definitely notice it.  But for the extra 10 to 20 minutes it takes to heat up a 12 x 12 room with 10' ceilings on eco with three huge windows and a bay window that is pretty good and is well worth the money.
For the cost of the unit and the amount it cost to run it is a great deal.  The thing is very light and has good safety features.  You can't go wrong, especially if you utilize the eco mode.

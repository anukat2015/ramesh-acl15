Title: Great DSLR
Content:
Moved from my trusty 20D to this 50D. Nice upgrade. Still have the 20D as a backup. The LCD screen is great. Menu even easier to use. My BG-E2 battery grip fit right on the 50D. I have 3 L lenses and the pictures are sharp and color is beautiful. You can't go wrong for this price.

Title: Fantastic camera
Content:
The D300 is a fantastic camera and an incredible value.  I am a professional photographer, and in this price range, I don't think there is anything out there that can touch it.  Nikon has finally gotten it's image quality, resolution, sharpness and focusing capability up there with Canon.  It is about time.  You can spend a lot more to get a better set of features, image size and  speed, but in my opinion, for this price, the D300 is tops.  The camera is a huge improvement over the slow focusing D200, and with the optional battery compatability, the shooting speed is well-suited for sports action.

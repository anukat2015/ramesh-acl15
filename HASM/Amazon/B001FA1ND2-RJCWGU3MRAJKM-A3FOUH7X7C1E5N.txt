Title: Love my new nano!
Content:
I upgraded from a second generation 4 GB, and cannot believe how small this ipod is and it has double the memory.  Really enjoy the shake to shuffle feature, I read other reviews on Amazon saying how "sensitive" this feature is, but have found that claim to be false.  I have to really shake it to change the song.

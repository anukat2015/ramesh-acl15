Title: Sony Delivers Once Again
Content:
I purchased this about a week ago, and its my very first laptop. And might I say it definitely set some high standards for future purchases. In terms of tech.. its very "up to date" with the new i3 processor, and blu ray player. Visually, the vaio is beautiful and compliments other sony househeld gadgets nicely (I have a Bravia, PS3, PSP, and T90 camera...all in this same "piano black" color..) 
Granted no laptop is perfect, as it faulters in the same areas all other laptops do. Unless you have a netbook, most laptops battery life last around 3-5 hours. This one is closer to 3.5, but with all the features and the powerful processor you really cant expect to have it all. But there are options for extended life batteries if it bugs you that much. The trackpad... similar to most laptops can be finnicky at times, but its a rare occurence...in other words, dont let that stop you from making the purchase. The only faulter would be the smudges, but if you're accustomed to most of Sony's other gadgets, you're familiar with it, and if you practice good housekeeping, this laptop will be sure to catch attention from bypassers. 
The issues that have been mentioned are kind of..just nagging to be nagging. I have no regrets of my purchase, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who considered it.

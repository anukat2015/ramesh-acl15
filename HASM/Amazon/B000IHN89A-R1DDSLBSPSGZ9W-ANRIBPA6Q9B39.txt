Title: Easy use with high quality photos!
Content:
Have used the camera for about 6 weeks with the family so have only touched the surface of this camera's abilities.  The quality of the photographs so far have been excellent.  Its use in the automatic settings has been easy and the shutter speed for repetitive action shots is superb!  Again, I have only started to learn all the functions of the camera but no disappointments thus far from this somewhat serious amateur.

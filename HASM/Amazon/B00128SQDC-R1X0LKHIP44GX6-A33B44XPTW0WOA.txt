Title: Another Nikon camera unusable by epileptics
Content:
If you have photosensitive epilepsy and have problems with blinking displays, etc. this camera is not for you ( I have it and I just lost $1300 since I have had it over a week and now I can't get my money back )
1) If autofocus does not lock on the autofocus status icon blinks
2) If the light meter is out of range, the EV scale blinks CONTINUOUSLY in the bottom center of the viewfinder display.
Nikon gets an F for disability accomodation. ( Ever see an accessibility menu on a Nikon product ( or any other, for that matter ). Apparently they have no concern for people with colorblindness, eye problems or epilepsy.
COMMENT:
When looking at a product....
If you have colorblindness, can you change the screen colors? ( You can with Garmin GPS units, as an example )
If you have poor eyesite, can you change the display size? ( Again Garmin allows this )
If the displays have blinking elements, can you disable the blinking?
The Nikon D200 is the ONLY Nikon camera that is generally usable by epileptics. The F6 has blinking problems as does the D80 and the D40X. ( Using these products is kind of like walking through a minefield; if you encounter an out-of-range condition the blinking starts and I am history for somewhere between an hour and a day. ). The new D40X is the worst of the bunch. The Canon Digital Rebel XTi is a very nice camera but again, it has major blinking problems. I have not been able to use either the Nikon D40X or the Canon Digital Rebel XTi since I first purchased them.

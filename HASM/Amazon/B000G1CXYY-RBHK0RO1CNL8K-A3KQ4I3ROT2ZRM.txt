Title: Satisfactory heat
Content:
This is a satisfactory and handy size heater.   Although the instructions say it is not for use in the bathroom, that is exactly where I need a heater in this transition period after air conditioning but before furnace help is needed to heat the whole house.  By plugging it in away from water sources in the bath room, it does a safe and satisfactory job in cutting the morning chill in the bathroom, making the start of the day much nicer.  It is at a bargain price and the lowest priced small heater I could find, so I am doubly pleased with its performance.  It is quick to start heating and makes a small bathroom comfortable in a few minutes.

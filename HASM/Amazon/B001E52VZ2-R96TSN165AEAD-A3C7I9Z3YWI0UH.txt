Title: Hard working little vac
Content:
We own a cleaning company and use the commercial version of this little vacuum almost exclusively. When we got a contract for a post construction cleaning for a condo complex we did not want to use our "good" Mighty Mites so we purchased this model because it was cheap. It cost less than half of the commercial model but had the smaller motor. We figured it was a throw away and truly didn't expect it to last thru the contract. 
However, it's now 2 years later and this vacuum is STILL plugging along! It has been abused and used A LOT! It has gone thru several post construction contracts on apartment complexes, a year of cleaning an industrial warehouse, and any other really dirty job that comes up. It has recently been cleaned up and put into service in an office. 
I don't recommend submitting your vacuum to any of those abuses but I can honestly say this little $60 vacuum has worked longer and harder than any vacuum our company has owned!
The only complaint I have is that the hose and tools are lighter weight than a commercial business needs so we have replaced them. Plus, and this is true of all models of the Mighty Mite, they really need to include the carpet head with the vacuum! You can purchase it separately but why not include it? Now you can also purchase (separately of course) a "turbo" carpet head but it costs more than the vacuum!
Regarding the HEPA filter - the older models and some of the less expensive models will not take the HEPA filter. It is a large filter that attaches over the exhaust port at the rear of the vacuum. I've only seen one model that takes it although there may be others by now.

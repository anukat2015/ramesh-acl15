Title: Not a 5 cup machine
Content:
Be aware that this coffee maker will not make enough coffee for two 12 oz mugs of coffee. Our previous 4 cup model will easily make enough for two 12 oz mugs of coffee, so we expected that this one would too. Not so. Not even close. Be aware also that you cannot use gold mesh filters in this machine. I called the manufacturer about it and they specifically designed it so that gold mesh filters will not fit. The excuse, er... reason, given was to avoid overflow. It may make decent coffee, but these are awfully small 5 cups! I returned it to Amazon with no problem.

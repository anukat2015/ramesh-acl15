Title: Machine does NOT suck!
Content:
And I do mean that in a negative way.
This is the animal hair Dyson, and on bare floors, it won't even pick up dust, much less cat hair.  I am very disappointed.  I have "troubleshot" everything, and there is just no sucking power for this machine.  I might as well get out my old corn broom and sweep.  
Most people gripe about the engineering and design of this model.  Well, I would not care if it looked like it was designed by Rube Goldberg.  I expect it to suck up a segment of a small dried leaf.  Zippo.  Nadda.
Stay away from this machine. I have no more time to waste to figure out why it will not do what it says it is supposed to do.

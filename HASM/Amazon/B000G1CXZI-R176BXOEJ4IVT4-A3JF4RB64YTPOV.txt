Title: Works great with proper placement
Content:
I bought this 2 winters ago for our finished second floor (of a 1 1/2 story house).
Basically a converted attic, split into 2 rooms. The space is insulated, and has a small energy efficient window at each end...but no source of heat.
  At first I put the radiator in the doorway between the 2 rooms .We use one room as an office/storage area, and the other as a TV lounge/music listening room.The radiator could not sufficiently heat both areas. Then, I moved it so it was under the window of the TV lounge. Awesome! Despite having good windows, cold air still seems to permeate the glass. The cold air falls and is warmed by the radiator. I can keep the radiator on low, set the timer for periods of actual use, and keep the room very toasty.
  I got a second radiator for the other window, and do the same thing. Both rooms are very toasty when we are home and occupying them.
  As an experiment, I tried the radiator in our unfinished basement, which we use as our music rehearsal space. Radiator could not keep up. Too much competition from concrete floor and block walls, and it's too big a space. I created a room by hanging curtains around our rehearsal space . Bought a Lasko ceramic heater with oscillator.It does a good job.
  So, the Delonghi radiator does a great job in a finished space when you place it where the coldest air is getting in. Do your best to seal any drafts with caulk or weatherstripping, then put the radiator in that area...not the middle of the room.

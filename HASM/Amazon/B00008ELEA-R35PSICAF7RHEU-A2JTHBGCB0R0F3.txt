Title: Great Little Percolator
Content:
This is the second one of these I have had.  I finally burned out the other one after many years of use.  One of the things I love about this is that if you like a really hot cup of coffee, this gives it to you.  I actually have to put one piece of ice in my mug just to cool it down enough to drink.  Also, it brews the coffee really fast.  If you travel a lot and like to have fresh brewed coffee for instance in your hotel room, this pot is small enough to pack and take with you.
I definitely recommend this percolator.  I wouldn't be without it.

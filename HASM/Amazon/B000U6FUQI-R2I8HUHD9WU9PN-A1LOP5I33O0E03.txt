Title: Good idea, not so good craftsmanship
Content:
I also bought this for quick pickups on hardwood floors.  It did ok with dust bunnies and very small dirt particles but I thought it would have more suction.  After using it three times the button that turns it on stopped working.  I have to continually hold the button down for it to run.  Very disappointed - it is going back to the store today.

Title: Great
Content:
I finally got mine today. I have not had time to do a lot with it, but so far i'm pleased.  I never had an ipod but i have had several other small mp3 players. 
First off, i really do not see what the big deal is about the softwear. Its pretty easy to use.
The screen is nice, but the entire thing gets a lot of smuges because its flat black. 
The screen size is great, i propped it up on my keyboard at work and watched it for quite a while. 
the battery life does not seem to bad, but could be better. I charged it for about an hour, it was already half way charged when i got it and when i took it off the charger it was almost full. I played with if off and on for about 7 hours at work (proably had it on about 3-4 hours total and i kept turning it on and off) with both video and audio and the battery was almost drained. 
It seems sturdy but i'm getting a case ASAP.
The video tilt is really nice.
it comes loaded with music, but you can not play anything untill you hook it of the first time. I really wish they did'nt preload anything on it but the backgrouds. 
the touch scroll is nice but a bit to sensitive, I turned it off on mine.  i played with my friends ipod a little and i liked the scroll on it much better. 
I really like the size. Not to big, not to small. Its thin and fits comfortable in a pocket. 
overall i really like it so far, and it is a great price for 80gs.

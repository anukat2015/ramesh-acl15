Title: Excellent!
Content:
This is one of the best coffee makers I have ever owned. I have gone through a lot of coffee makers and got so tired of wet counters and coffee drips/spills all over due to inferior design on the carafes. Since I got this one, not one spilled drop! It makes good coffee and is relatively fast. I highly recommend it.

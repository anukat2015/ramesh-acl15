Title: Great laptop.. but there is one huge issue I wish I had known about before buying.
Content:
I love my new macbook pro.. but I wish I had known that the nvidia 8600m GT gpu is faulty, and has a very high chance of failing.  Apple has added an extra year to the standard warranty to cover faulty gpu issues, but I probably would have gone for the new glossy macbook if I had known.
For what it's worth, nvidia are at fault, not apple.  
Google the gpu.  Every laptop from every manufacturer (dell, hp, and others) with that series is affected.

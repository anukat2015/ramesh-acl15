Title: Bunn BX-B Classic Review
Content:
We love coffee and have plenty of so called "Connoisseurs" in our household.  This coffee pot is for the office of quick and easy & not for the discriminating coffee lovers.   The temperature is just not hot enough and the rapid spray of water really does not do the coffee beans justice.  I would not purchase this coffee pot if you enjoy good coffee.  Quick, yes.

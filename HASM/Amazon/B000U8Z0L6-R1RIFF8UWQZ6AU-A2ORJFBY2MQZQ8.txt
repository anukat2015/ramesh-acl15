Title: Lasko 5355 Ceramic Pedestal Heater
Content:
This model is a definte improvement over previous models.  My family has 2 of the older models where the vents are closer to the floor.  This meant that primarily your feet will be warmed but not the rest of you.  In the 5355 model, the warm air is blown out higher from the floor as contrasted to the older models with a much more comfortable result.  
The pluses are that this unit was easy to assemble and works well.  The LCD screen is easy to see and the controls are not difficult to learn.  
One criticism I have is the remote which is identical practically to the ones used on earlier models. There is no pouch or holder on the unit to store the remote.  Sticking vicryl on the remote and unit became a nuisance with the older remotes since they kept falling off!!  Fortunately we really didn't need the remote; so this was not a problem for us.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this unit for keeping a room, such as a family room, warm.

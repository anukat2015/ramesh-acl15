Title: HP laptops have long term quality issue
Content:
HP's quality are being probed and many laptops recalled in Asia now.
Quite a few models are being reported with display problems.
The US models are not much better. My own $1000 laptop broke down right 
after warranty period and the customer service manager said "we can't do any thing 
for you." So, just stay away from HP laptops.

Title: Great sound, great price!
Content:
Not wanting to spend the ridiculous money on an IPOD, I opted for the SanDisk Sansa M240 1GB MP3 Player.  This thing is tiny but comes with a wrist strap and a protective cover, and the sound from the headphones is actually really great. The only downer is that there isn't a menu you can scroll through to get to the folder you want to hear.  But for the price and the amount of space on this player, its definitely worth it.

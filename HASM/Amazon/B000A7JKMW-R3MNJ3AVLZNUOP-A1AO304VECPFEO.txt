Title: Love it!
Content:
I just got my Maxxum 5D and I absolutely love it. It feels solid, not plastic-like at all. All the buttons are in the right places, and it's very easy to take pictures any way you want. Image stabilization gives you about one extra stop of light - great to take pictures without flash that would need flash otherwise.
It seems quite hard to get lenses, if you don't have any, ordering the kit is a good idea in case the lens you ordered is on backorder.
Absolutely recommended.

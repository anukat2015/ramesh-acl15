Title: 2 New Units Quit Heating
Content:
Let me say that I really liked this appliance.  I used it ALOT.  4-7 times a day I think.  BUT, my first was purchased in November 2006.  By New Year's day, it no longer heated water.  Contacted MFG and wasn't very impressed although they offered to replace.  Amazon replaced OVERNIGHT!  Loved the replacement.  In March 2007, the replacement no longer heated.  Contacted MFG. and was suggested "using the appliance on a circuit/outlet with ANY other appliance was not recommended"  she further offered that my electrical system might be substandard and the toaster I use twice a year was likely frying my Keurig.  Called Amazon.  They gladly processed my second B70 for return.  My Cusinart Grind & Brew has been plugged into the same outlet for 5 years before the Keurig sent it to the basement.  It still works great.  Not sure why each of my 2 Keurig B70's died twice. Apparently, I'm not good at feeding and watering but, I did love it.  That blue LED light made my houseguests seem like mosquitos at a lightbulb.  I have a ton of K-cups in my cabinet. Maybe I'll try a smaller model.

Title: Takes the chill off of family room
Content:
I bought this unit after reading articles, reviews, and looking at various portable heaters.  I am not sure it's the best, but it serves the purpose I was looking for.  Our lower level family room (13' x 32'), with a 6' opening fireplace at one end, always had a little chill. My wife used a little personal blanket to stay warm. So far this winter with the heater set on the lowest of 3 setting and the thermostat set a low setting and the heater set to be on 16 hours a day, the room is more comfortable and my wife doesn't use the blanket anymore.  I like the idea of and enclosed heater within the oil; seems like a safer unit to me, rather than a glowing strip heater. This little unit seems to have done what I was looking for with out spending a lot of money.

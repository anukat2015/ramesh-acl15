Title: BUNN ain't what it used to be.
Content:
I always had a Bunn coffee maker. My 5 yr old Bunn GR10 finally lost its ability to maintain a hot cup of coffee. The new NHBX 10 is the replacement. Bunn claims that the internal water temp is 200 degrees and is at the ideal level for perfect brewed coffee. I measured the water temp in the carafe and it was 180 degrees. The coffee is not hot enough. In hindsight, knowing what I know now, I would not buy this, as my coffee is not super hot and does not stay hot. If you want hot coffee, buy a commercial coffeemaker. Stay away from consumer grade coffee makers.

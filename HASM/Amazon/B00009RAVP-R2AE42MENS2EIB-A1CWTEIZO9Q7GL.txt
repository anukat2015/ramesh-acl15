Title: Great for a single room use, but awfully bright.
Content:
This heater was purchased primarily to heat an office.  It does the job very well, even at the low setting.  It is, however, very bright and I do not recommend it for a bedroom, unless you aren't sensitive to light while you sleep.  Other than that, the price is fine for what it does.

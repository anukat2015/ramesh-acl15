Title: Poor Design
Content:
The suction on this machine seems like it should be up to par, but the design of the attachments leaves an air gap between the wand and the attachments so that the only way to get 100% suction out of them is to tape around the exposed gap.  At the list price, you should not have to do anything to it!!  The beater bar attachment does not have this problem and seems to work fine.

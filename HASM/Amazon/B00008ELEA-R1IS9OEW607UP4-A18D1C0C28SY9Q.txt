Title: NOT THE QUALITY THEY USED TO BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I purchased the 12-cup percolator at an upscale department store.
(Long before I knew about Amazon)My mother had this pot and a smaller size.  They lasted many years and made excellent coffee.  When I found the 12-cup I did not hesitate, I bought one. Before six months,I began to notice the coffee was getting weaker.  Finally, the coffee would be ready in minutes,but very weak.  At the end it brewed in seconds.  The water was tinted light brown and was barely warm.  Since then I have read reviews of others experiencing similar problems.  Of course, the dept. store would not let me return it.  It ended up in the garbage.  I would encourage others to consider other brands.  Farberware seems to have let their quality take a huge nose dive.

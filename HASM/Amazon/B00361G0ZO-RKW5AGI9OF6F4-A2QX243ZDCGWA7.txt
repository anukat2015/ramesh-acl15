Title: Asus Rock Solid, Meteor hot.
Content:
Pros: This product is rock solid so far had for 2 days so far. I have stressed this thing as far as I could. This machine handles almost all the games I play at full settings (Wow, LOTRO, WC3, Also some different FPSs.). This machine runs things fast program wis0e. All video buffering on this machine is lightning fast. The video on this machine is almost top of the line for a laptop. Intel + Nvidia, Mind blowing combination(Almost 10,000 3DMark06 score). This laptop comes with the Turbo Boost option. This option is a performance overhaul, Caution WILL Light it up. The backlite keyboard is nice if you do gaming in the dark like I do. The display on this machine is gorgeous. Full 1080pHD is the only way to go. Windows 7 really takes full visual advantage that this machine can offer.
Cons: This thing gets hot when at full performance.I will be purchasing a cooler. This is probably necessary no mater which brand gaming laptop you will purchase. The battery life on the power saving mode is about 2 3/4 hours. This is a short battery in comparison to other laptops however, This is a desktop replacement machine(should be plugged in anyways). The keypad is rather small. They could have made it a bit bigger but I personally still like the fact of a number pad.
Other Thoughs: Really perfect for me. I would suggest to my friends. This is a Sick bang for the buck, this machine should probably be in the low 1,400 ranges but is so low(in my opinion).

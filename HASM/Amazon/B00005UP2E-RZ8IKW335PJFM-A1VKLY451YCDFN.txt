Title: Breeze through vacuuming
Content:
I LOVE this vacuum. I owned a Dirt Devil canister vac for 12 years. It finally died and I knew I only wanted another Dirt Devil. We searched amazon and found this Breeze. I LOVE this vacuum cleaner. It is lightweight, easy to clean and empty.It picks up everything easily. I recommend it highly.

Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
My husband and I are BIG coffee drinkers and we've been through SO many coffee makers! Words can't express how we feel about the Hamilton Beach Coffee Station! It took a little getting used to since we've always used multiple brands with the glass pots but we ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MACHINE! We use a lot less coffee in the process too which saves a load of $! 
We didn't buy this product from Amazon but sure wish we would have... GREAT PRICE! Ours was 80.00 at Meijer which was well worth it I might add! 
Thank you, Hamilton Beach! No more Bunn, Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid for us... YUK! :)

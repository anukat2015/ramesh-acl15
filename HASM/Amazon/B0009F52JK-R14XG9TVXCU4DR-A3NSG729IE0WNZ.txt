Title: Hot Coffee
Content:
This does exactly what I want. An added plus: I don't like grinds in my coffee, so I usually use a paper filter. The holes are so small in the basket, that there is no filter needed. The grinds don't get through. I read the manual, not something I usually do and it's a short read, and it said to wet the bottom of the basket so no grinds get through and it works every time. Now I have all these extra filters... Good coffee maker.

Title: HP Pulling Away From The Pack
Content:
May 2, 2009
I am extremely pleased with this laptop purchase and the excellent and thorough customer service issued by HP from delivery onward. I am not, in this concise review going to offer my perceptions of the outstanding technical ability of this unit due to space considerations. Suffice to say HP has been the leader in home and business computing for many years now and known widely and internationally as a top flight engineering and scientific plus corporation. To acquire a sophisticated unit from HP, having purchased this laptop myself through this site at a miraculous and more than competitive price point can only be considered by the customer to be a win/win situation. As someone owning a home business, reliability and functionality is of the utmost importance. My wife as well, organizing family sports events also profits from the accuracy that HP offers with this Compaq Presario laptop.

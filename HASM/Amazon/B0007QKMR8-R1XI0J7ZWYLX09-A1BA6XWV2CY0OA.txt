Title: Great Camera
Content:
As a parent of two young children I was looking for a camera that would take great pictures as well as be user friendly. I've found both in the Canon Rebel XT. I am a bit of a novice with the camera and I didn't want to bust my budget with an expensive camera purchase that was more camera than I needed or would ever even learn how to use. I've found this camera to take excellent pics while not overwhelming me with a lot of extra buttons or features that I won't use. My only complaint about the camera itself is the lens that came with the camera. The zoom on the camera is virtually non-existent and I found this to be a little frustrating now that I realize I will have to spend several hundred more dollars for a good zoom lens. But all in all, the pictures the SLR camera takes are far superior to any lesser digital camera on the market. I definately don't regret spending the extra money for a better camera.

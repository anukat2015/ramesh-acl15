Title: Screen Self Destructs
Content:
We bought the 30GB video iPod last Christmas (05) and on day 100 (10 days out of warrenty)  the screen spontaneously cracked from the inside, without being dropped or mishandled.  It literally went into the pocket OK and came out a few minutes later broken!  Again, there was nothing that should have caused it to break!  And, there is no exterior damage or scratching whatever.  From reading posts at Apple and elsewhere, it is very common with this model.  Beware!  
We took it to the local Apple store in Tampa and fortunately in our case it was declared caused by an internal "thermal" problem that cracked the inside glass layer. The tell-tale sign were large "ink spot" looking marks on the screen, being only cracked inside--the outer plastic layer was perfect, and absolutely not external damage evident.  Got a new iPod.  Apple didn't quibble about being a little past the 90 days...and now we have 180 days from the orginal purchase.  A great prduct but two stars because of the self-destructive nature of the video iPod's (like the Nano before) screen.

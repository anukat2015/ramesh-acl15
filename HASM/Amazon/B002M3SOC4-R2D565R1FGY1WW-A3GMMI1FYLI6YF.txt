Title: List of Cons
Content:
Don't take this the wrong way, I absolutely love my ipod touch. However, I believe all of you already know all the goodies in the gadget, so I will just create a list of all the Cons I've experienced so far (1 month) into my ipod touch.
Cons: 
-some of my apps refuse to open (happened 3 times to me). It just simply goes to the loading page, but after a split of a second, it returns to the ipod homepage. The first and third time I simply resynced my ipod to itunes. But during the 2nd time, I had to do a complete factory reset, losing all my songs, apps, and videos. I resynced my ipod for the songs, but I had to redownload the apps. sort of time consuming. I checked online and it happened to numerous other ipods as well, not sure why.
-Although the touchscreen is great, it could use a next/previous song button (physical). I am someone who walks around listening to my ipod in my pocket with the shuffle option. Whenever I come upon a song I do not want to listen to, I would hit the next song button. The ipod touch does not have that option. The only way for me to keep shuffling is to use the "shake to shuffle" option. The bad thing about that is sometimes the shake to shuffle would not respond, while other times it would shuffle my ipod from a slight bounce in my steps. If I lock my ipod, it will ask me to slide the bar across the touchscreen to unlock it, oftentimes making me take it out of my pocket to see the bar. "Shake to shuffle" also replays a song that already played without going through all your songs.
-I bought the 32GB version, partly because I wanted to use the voice control option. Although the voice control recognizes my commands well, it is not convenient for its purpose. You actually have to hold down the home button for 3-4 seconds before you are allowed to speak commands in it, and it only stays on for one command. As soon as you give your command and it recognizes, you will have to hold down the home button again to reopen the voice control. This is a bit time consuming when you just want to go to the next song, like I said earlier, it lacks the next/previous song button.
-Fingerprint/dust/grease magnet. The smudges bother me because I like to keep my gadgets in mint conditions. 
-No camera, it has this black cover in the back, the same place where the iphone has its camera. Apple obviously was in a rush to meet demands on time so they excluded the camera, or they wanted to nurture the iphone line a bit more. Did a bit of research online and found out that someone opened up the ipod touch and found empty space where the camera ought to be. Between the black cover and the empty space, you can definitely expect ipod touch 4g to have a camera. 
-I do not like how it forces you to slide the bar across the screen to unlock whenever you turn off or lock your ipod. I liked nano's "Hold" bar much better, so I can actually feel it in my pocket without taking it out. 
-Battery life runs out pretty quick if you play games on it often.
That is all I can find to complain about. Still, I love this little device and I find it extremely useful.

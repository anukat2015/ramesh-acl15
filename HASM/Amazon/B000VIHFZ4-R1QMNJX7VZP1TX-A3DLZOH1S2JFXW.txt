Title: Compact and easy to use. I like it!
Content:
I bought this one a couple of months ago. So far I like it a lot! It's small (which is very important to me. I did't like to use my Zune because it was heavy to carry it in my pocket).
I study a foreign language and use it in the subway when I go to work (to improve my pronunciation). It's easy to navigate and the sound quality is very good also. I know it can be used to listen to radio and record voice, but I haven't tried that yet.
I did not like the fact that it shuts down if you put it on pause for some time (sometimes I have to pause it to repeat the sentance, but when I press play again - it does not work. I had to power it on again. I'm sure there should be a way to adjust the time before it shuts down).
Overall I highly recommend this product.

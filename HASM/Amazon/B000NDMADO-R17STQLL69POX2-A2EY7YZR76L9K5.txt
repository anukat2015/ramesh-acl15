Title: Great Vacuuming power; telescoping stuff a bit hard
Content:
A really good vacuum as far as sucking power, maneuverabilty, and ease of cleaning go. The wand has to be pulled really hard for the three bits to 'click' into place...i think after a few times, one gets a hang of how much pressure needs to be applied to extend the wand completely. 
I don't know if there is some thing to make carpeted staircase cleaning easier the head is still too big for my stairs. Overall, a great buy.

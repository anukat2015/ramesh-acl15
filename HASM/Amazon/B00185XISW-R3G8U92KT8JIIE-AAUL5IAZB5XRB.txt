Title: Nice while it lasted.
Content:
I bought these units two years ago.  They worked very well during that time.  However, this year when I turned them on I smelled something strange.  I came back the next day to find a black and melted mark where the power supply connects to the unit.  It also had stopped working.  About a week later I came down to turn on the second unit and found that it was turned on but was not working.  I touched the spot where the cord enters the unit and it fell out.  I am NOT going to attempt to get them replaced because I do not feel secure having these units in the house anymore.  I really liked the concept and enjoyed them while they lasted however, coming downstairs and finding melted electronics is not really comforting.

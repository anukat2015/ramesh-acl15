Title: I'm So Happy!!!
Content:
This Camera is excellent, my wife has a Nikon D80 and she tells me the D90 has more functionallity, color control and the live view is excellent option. I bought separetly a lens (the 18-200 mm nikon lens) and the combination was perfect.
Be carefull you need Adobe Photoshop CS3 o CS4 with camera raw updated to work with RAW Files from this camera or Nikon Capture NX, but the camera comes with ViewNX software that help you with the basics RAW file options.
Other great feature is if you have parts (battery, grips, memories, flashes, etc.) from D80 camera you can use them in your D90. For the functionallity and features, its price is ok. I recomend a lot of this camera. I hope to publish photos soon.
Thanks a lot

Title: Excellent for the Price
Content:
For the price I paid, this was a steal. The configuration was very good and the laptop wasn't a budget looking laptop - it catches quite a few envious looks when I use it at a public place. The only bad bit is that it comes pre-installed with a lot of free Yahoo games which needed t be uninstalled along with the free trial version of 1 or 2 software. But then for the price, it was an amazingly sweet deal!

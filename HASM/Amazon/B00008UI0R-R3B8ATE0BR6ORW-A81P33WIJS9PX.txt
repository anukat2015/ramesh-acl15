Title: Best Vacuum ever!
Content:
We had just finished remodeling our kitchen top to bottom and my old vacuum just didn't seem to be doing the job so I decided it was time for a new one.  I bought this vacuum on the advice of a friend and I couldn't be happier.  I used it to vacuum carpets after using my old one and was amazed at all the sheet rock dust that still came out.  The Finger-Touch Variable Speed Control as well as the on/off and floor/carpet options on the handle make it a breeze to switch between the speeds and floor types.

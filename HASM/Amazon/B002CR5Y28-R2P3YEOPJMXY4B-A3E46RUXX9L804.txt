Title: A good buy
Content:
I was researching buying a vacuum, and wanted my money to be spent well. I wanted a product that was well built, will last long, and was good for allergies. I saw this on amazon, but ended up buying from a certified miele dealer, that made me a really good deal. Otherwise I would have gotten it from amazon, considering the free shipping and no tax option. this vacuum is wonderful. The suction is amazing, and the turbobrush for my wool rugs cant be beat. The hardwood attatchment is great, consideirng most of my home is hardwood and tile. It is so quiet, and my home is so small, so someone can be taking a nap, and the other can still clean!! I absolutely love this vacuum. You won't be sorry you paid a lot for this. If I had a bigger home, and wall to wall carpet, I would have had to get a more expensive model, or at least an upright along with this model. This company has a very good product. you wont be sorry!!

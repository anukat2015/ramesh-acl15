Title: Piece of Art - Carved to Perfection - Incredible Laptop
Content:
I have owned many different computers over the years (mostly Macs with a Mac clone somewhere in there). This is, hands down, the best computer I have ever owned. It is a solid body unit, with a gorgeous screen, backlit keyboard, and everything you could want in a laptop. The new multitouch trackpad just finishes this off as a must buy. 
If you are on the fence about getting a new laptop (to run the MacOS or Windows) - this IS the laptop you have always wanted.
PROS
Great Screen (some don't like the gloss, but I think it's bright enough to not matter)
Backlit Keyboard (great when in a dark room)
Solid, Unibody Construction (light but solid)
Good Speakers
Very unique multi-touch trackpad that adds a lot to the laptop
Very powerful and feature loaded
CONS
It's not cheap - but you get what you pay for.

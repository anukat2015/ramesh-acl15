Title: More Money Doesn't Guarantee Quality
Content:
We just purchased the Electrolux "Quiet Clean" Canister Vacuum, model Oxygen3. It is sleek, it is quiet, but unfortunately it's also not working. The vacuum works, but the "Power Brushroll" died only moments after its maiden voyage onto our carpet. We have verified that it isn't "Jammed" or user-servicable, it's just dead. We expected a $400 product to be free from these kinds of aggravations. We called Electrolux and got our closest "Warranty Service Center" which was anything but close. The gentleman we talked to at "Vacuum Zone" told us they weren't interested and to return the entire unit to the place we bought it from. I can see resolving this issue is going to be time-consuming and it's going to cost us money. Do not buy this product. Buy a vacuum from a brick-and-mortar store, and don't expect it to work no matter how much you pay for it.

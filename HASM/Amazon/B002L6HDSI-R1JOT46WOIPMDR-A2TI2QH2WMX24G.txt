I liked the IPOD NANO 5th generation.Good sound quality, easy to use and built well. The only problem I had was with the Ear piece connector plug. Sometimes it works okay. Put sometimes it doesn't make any conection and I had to shove it in and out several times before I got any sound. This happened on two IPODS I had to purchase. Is there a better Ear Piece that I could purchase to resolve this problem?

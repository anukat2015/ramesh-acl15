Title: This heater would not heat!
Content:
DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater
This heater didnot work, it was defective I'm wondering if it had been returned and Amazon put it back in stock and filled another order with it. This is the second heater I purchased from Amazon that was defective. The first one was a Soleus radiant heater, it caught on fire after being use about 3 months. I have a small heater I bought from Target 2 yrs ago for $7.50, it works just fine. I'm disabled and needed a good heater to keep near my chair. I am not buying anymore heaters from Amazon I think they may be getting defective merchandise from suppliers. In fact I will limit my shopping from Amazon from now on. It is just too much trouble to deal with sending things back and waiting for their customerservice to get a refund. I gave it one star only because it looks good!!

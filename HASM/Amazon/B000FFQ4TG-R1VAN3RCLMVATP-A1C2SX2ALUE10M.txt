Title: Be very careful about buying this.
Content:
I bought this coffee maker for 2 reasons, 1) would make a pot in 3 minutes, and 2) claimed to brew at the proper temperature of 200 degrees. The 3 minute claim is extremely misleading if not false.  This coffee maker operates differently than others in that it has a tank that you keep filled with water and you keep hot by leaving it on all of the time.  That means that the coffee maker is on 24/7 365 days a year.  The way it works is when you pour in water to make coffee the "new" water displaces the already hot "old" water that has been sitting in there for however long it has been since you last used it.  It recommends that you turn it off if you aren't going to use it for more than 2 days.  Well we only make coffee at home on weekends, and to reheat the entire tank takes over 15 minutes. So the 3 minute claim is more like 20 minutes to make a pot of coffee.  Funny they don't exactly state that anywhere on the box and it is borderline revealed in the instructions.  Needless to say it got returned immediately.  Might make a good cup of coffee in the end but I'll never know.

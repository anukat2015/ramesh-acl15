Title: JUNK!  DO NOT BUY!
Content:
ok, changing my review from the earlier.   THIS COMPUTER IS JUNK!   DO NOT BUY IT!   Has been to Sony already to be fixed. Lost the screen completely after only 2 weeks of use.  Took 3 WEEKS TO GET IT BACK.  Now it locks up completely randomly.  Not the program or windows, but the entire computer, keyboard and all. And the fan is REALLY noisy.   I will never buy Sony again.  Also, Amazon's return policy says that I can only get a partial refund.  What a crock!

Title: great little netbook+
Content:
I bought this model because it has a beefier Core2 Solo SU3500 CPU than the typical Atom based Netbook.  I also researched the newer low-cost Intel Celeron M 743 that has 2 cores, but less cache (1MB vs 3MB) and double the power dissipation, i figured the Core2 Solo processor in this one hit a good place between performance and battery life.
Having played with this computer for a while, i really like it.  Very portable with a nice sharp screen.  It boots to usable internet in 1:15 in Vista and 0:38 using Ubuntu (netbook reloaded edition).  
Notes:
I found a great sleeve case that fits like a glove made by MobileEdge at microcenter called 'Special Edition' made for 11.6 netbooks.
Pros:
Nice build quality
good battery life
HDMI port
came with a single 2GB SODIMM for easy upgrade to 4GB
small charger
Cons:
Slight vibration noise when fan is running.
no bluetooth (although there is a keyboard icon, on/off switch.  there is an empty place in underside compartment, but no socket, just unsoldered contacts)

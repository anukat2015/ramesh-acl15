Title: great camera, few problems
Content:
Overall this camera is amazing. The only problem is the focus problems that are well documented elsewhere. The mirror fix and firmware upgrade from Canon helped, but there is still a tendency for focus to drift when shooting rapid fire. However, under low light there is not any camera that even comes close to it for quality.

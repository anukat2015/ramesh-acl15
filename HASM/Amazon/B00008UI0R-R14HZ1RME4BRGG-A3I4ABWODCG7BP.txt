Title: Impressive and inexpensive
Content:
After some hesitation about going bagless I decided to take the plunge. Found this model at a pretty good price, and checked out all the reviews I could find on it. I fall on the side of the best reviews. It cleans excellently and I was actually appalled at the amount of dirt that my previous vacuum had left behind. It is quiet, lightweight and with variable suction is very efficient. My favorite feature is the footpedal release of the wand; I no longer have to bend over and try to depress with my fingernail a miniscule button to pull out the wand to clean wall edges and around doors etc. And bagless is great, don't know what I was waiting for!

Title: Best space heater
Content:
Best space heater!   Especially when you have babies and young children.   I keep one in my master suit which is about 20x16.   Whole upstairs is about 61 degrees when the suit is set at 70 during winter time.  I feel better that I am not heating up the whole upstairs when I only need the heat in my suit.    I also keep 2 of these in my finished basement which is about 40X15.   Without the heater, basement is at around 58, with it 73 when set at medium setting.    My baby can touch it and get startled, but never caused any scream or crying.    I feel very safe and good about this heater.  VERY EASY TO FIGURE OUT THE CONTROL!....well if you are used to setting outlet timers.

Title: Good Vacuum
Content:
I've owned this product for nearly three years and am very pleased. Emissions is excellent-it will not blow around/spit out dust. The suction power is great on both carpet and bare floors. One complaint is how it loses suction power as the bag fills. Dysons are advertised as being able to maintain full suction power, even when they need to be emptied. I wish my Kenmore were like that. 
If you're working with powdered carpet cleaner (like Capture), be aware the bag will fill quickly. You'll want to change the bag after working with substances like that. 
The pet hair attachment is wonderful for stairs and cars. It can be slightly difficult to attach/remove, especially when you first start using it. 
All the other attachments slip on and off very easily. Though another complaint would be that the door on the body of the canister where the attachments are stored is flimsy. Sometimes you have to fight to shut it. 
I like that this vacuum is lightweight and easy to handle. Carrying it up and down stairs is pretty easy. Vacuuming the stairway isn't too much of a chore. It does a great job of reaching into tight spaces, especially with the help of the attachments. 
Overall, I'm very happy with this vacuum. It delivers great performance at a good value. Remember to look over your owner's manual. You'll discover helpful tips on how to make this thing run more efficiently.

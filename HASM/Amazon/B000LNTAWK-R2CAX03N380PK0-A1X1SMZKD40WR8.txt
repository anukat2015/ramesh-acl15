Title: Awesome Product!
Content:
I totally fell in love with it the moment I got it.  It's a great product, takes amazing picture, and is worth the money.  I got a super deal here too, with the 18-200mm lens.  I had a friend how had it for a greater price than I did.  Like all DSLR cameras, you need to learn how to use it if you have not used one before.  But it is really worth it.  Allows me to take pictures I was not able to before.  You can see the difference.

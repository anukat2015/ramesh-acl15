Title: Had my DV4 for almost 1 year
Content:
Great machine for price and functionality. Exactly what I purchased it for, it does. I take really good care of this machine. It never fell, it's always in its case and I'm probably on it for about 3 hours straight per day. No shut downs, no bugs no complaints really except the keys had begun to fall out after 8 months. I'm using double sided tape to solve that problem. I'm not too pleased about that but I guess that's all in the engineering of the product.

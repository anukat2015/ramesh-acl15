Title: Good suction poor design
Content:
This vacuum worked great for the first 24 months, then the power head became extremely intermittent. The connections in the wand had expanded, resulting in arcing, resulting in making a poor connection. Since the vacuum was out of warranty, the wands were replaced for about $50 (more plastic, slightly different design).  After about 8 months, the powerhead once again started intermittent operation.  This is unacceptable for a $500+ vacuum, and which for the price should last more than 3 years.  Electrolux used to have a reputation of high design and high quality workmanship. I have since found out that this is a recurring problem with this vacuum, and will never purchase another electrolux.

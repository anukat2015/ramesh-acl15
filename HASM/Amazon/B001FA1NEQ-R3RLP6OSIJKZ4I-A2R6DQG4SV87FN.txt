Title: Get a protective cover with a clip!
Content:
I bought my husband one for his birthday. Bought it on Tuesday. Uploaded songs to it on Wednesday. Gave it to him on Thursday. He dropped it on Sunday. Not far - less than 2 feet. The glass shattered. The LCD still works, the music still plays but the glass is not tempered, not coated and not shatter resistant. I don't know if a protective cover would have helped but at least I wouldn't have broken glass everywhere. They either need to include a replacement glass or sell it with a small clip on it like the shuffle. We have an appt. with the apple store in Plano and hope that Apple will provide a free replacement as they have done for others in similar cases.

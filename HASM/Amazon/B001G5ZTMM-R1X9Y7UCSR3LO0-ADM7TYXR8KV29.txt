Title: Fabulous camera when it works
Content:
This camera takes fabulous photos and HD videos. The 24 - 105mm f/4L IS USM lens in the kit version is also superb--probably the best all-around lens you can get for this camera.  The lack of autofocus in video mode is a slight drawback, but the HD quality is astounding.  The only drawback I've found is the lack of reliability: mine has conked out twice already and had to be sent to the Canon repair center!  Don't count on it as your only camera in a critical situation.

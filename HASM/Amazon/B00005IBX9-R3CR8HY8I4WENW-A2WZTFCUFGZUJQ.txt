Title: Cuisinart 12 cup great!
Content:
This is my second Cuisinart.  The first one was damaged during a lightening storm. The flavor of the coffee is excellant and you can set the clock to have your coffee ready before you get up in the mornings.  We also enjoy the heat adjustment for the brew.  Can set to suit yourself. We will most likly keep using this product for years to come. If there is anything negative I would say about this product it would be that when I do not set the clock to auto brew, and I make the coffee in the morning while half asleep, sometimes I do not get the pot all the way on the heating pad. This product will not brew your coffee properly if you do not have the pot on the heating pad.

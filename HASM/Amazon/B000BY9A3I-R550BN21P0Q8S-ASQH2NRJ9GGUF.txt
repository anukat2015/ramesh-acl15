Title: Good Suction Horrible Cord
Content:
The vacuum boasts an automatic cord retraction.  I received this vacuum and plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised with the suction. Then i hit the cord retraction button only to find that it didn't retract.  So now I was stuck with 20 feet of cord that wouldn't go back into the system.  I contacted amazon and returned this product for the same vacuum, only to find that this cord didn't retract either.  Overall I am very disappointed with this vacuum and have contacted dirt devil to find out why neither of these vacuums cords automatically retracted.  The funny part about the whole thing is that the instructions tell you to hold the cord to avoid it from whipping back at you.

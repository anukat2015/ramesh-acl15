Title: Great for all floor types!
Content:
I LOVE this vacuum! We have 2 small children and we always need to get out the vacuum for quicky crumb clean ups and more.  This one is as easy to get out and use as the broom would be.  It's light enough to tag behind you up the stairs and small enough to store easily.  I love being able to press a button with my foot and see the cord ravel itself quickly back up inside the unit. The attachments are easy to use.  You can even disconnect the main attachment with a button with your foot and snap the new ones right on.  The suction is unbelievable.  I could hardly belive how dirty our rugs were when I first used it.  The dust collector is also a cinch to remove and empty.  I am very thrifty and thought twice before spending this much on a vacuum but it has been worth every penny.  I have a wool oriental rug, a shag and berber.  I also use it on hardwood and ceramic tile.  This machine does it all.

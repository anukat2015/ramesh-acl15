Title: a lot of camera for the price
Content:
I use both the EOS 1D Mark II and III for a lot of action photography (birds in flight and such).  The 50D locks on focus faster than either.  The extra megapixels offered by the 50D brings a significant improvement in detail to my photographs, as well.  It is nice that photographers graduating from the 20D up through the series to the 50D can still use the same batteries and chargers on this latest model.
My one little complaint is that Canon still hasn't found a way in this model series to move the "depth of field preview" button to the right side of the lens mount so that it can be easily accessed by a finger on the shooting (right) hand.  Doing so eliminates the necessity for moving either hand from their normal shooting positions to check depth of field. I suppose this is a problem mostly for those of us who use telephoto lenses a lot.

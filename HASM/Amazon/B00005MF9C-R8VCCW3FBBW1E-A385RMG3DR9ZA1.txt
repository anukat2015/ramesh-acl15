Title: Black & Decker Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker
Content:
This personal Coffeemaker is relatively quick and handy, but whenever I make a cup of coffee, the bottom of my coffee mug is always littered with coffee grounds.  The coffeemaker utilizes a permanent filter so I can't figure out why the grounds end up in my mug. For this reason, I do not use it very much.

Title: The best, but the best isn't good enough!
Content:
When my krups of 9 years broke, I was looking to kick it up a notch and replace it with something better.  My wish-list, I thought, was simple: 1)Brushed Chrome finish, 2)Digital LED readout so I can actually SEE the time, 3)12-cup capacity, 4)Carafe Pot.  Of course it had to have an auto-start feature as well.  Well, I searched high and low, and this coffee maker doesn't exist!  So, I found this cuisinart to be the next best thing.  It IS a small hole to pour the water through, but not really a problem.  My only complaint would be that the condensation is a bit much... about 4-5 tablespoons worth.  I think this is basically a design flaw.  Be prepared to wipe up the excess condensation each day on the inside top lid.  If you're preparing the coffee the night prior to the auto-start the following morning, wiping up the condensation is a must to prevent premature wetting of the grounds.  On a positive note, the unit is sturdy, the pot doesn't dribble or spill, and the coffee is what you would expect.  The charcoal filter is a plus for those with hard water.  I give it a B-.

Title: Cuisinart coffee maker and the handicapped
Content:
This coffee maker is great for my husband.  He is in a wheel chair and also has limited use of his left hand. He is able to get coffee without lifing a pot and it sure makes life easier.  It also makes a great cup of coffee.Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker

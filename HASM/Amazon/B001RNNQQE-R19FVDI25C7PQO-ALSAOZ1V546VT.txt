Title: This Cuisinart coffeemaker has it all!
Content:
Compact size (small footprint) yet brews a BIG pot of coffee! The Cuisinart Compact Coffeemaker has it all: programmable (even just 1 to 4 cups), water filter, gold "rinse and re-use" coffee filter, easy to use. Now have coffee READY when you wake up - or brew it and let it stay HOT in the THERMAL carafe. Coffee does not sit there, and burn, on a heating element! agf! We've enjoyed ours for years with no problems! Highly recommended.

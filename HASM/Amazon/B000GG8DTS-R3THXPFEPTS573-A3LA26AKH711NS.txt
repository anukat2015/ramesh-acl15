Title: Not What I Expected
Content:
This unit uses a ni-chrome style heating element to generate it's heat. You have to be within a foot or two to actually feel the warmth that it projects though.I was a bit disappointed compared to the very noticeable heat zone that the larger halogen parabolic units put out. The heat zone on this 9" dish is so unimpressive, you'll probably never find one of these on active display. People will buy these assuming that they just put out a smaller, but equally noticed heat zone like the larger units... Not true.. Caveat Emptor....  Overall though it serves it's purpose : Warming up the 2'x2' area that the dog sleeps in at night. The red glow isn't to obnoxious in a dark room and it has a tilt switch that cuts the power if it's knocked over. I think the tilt switch is too sensitive though. Tilt it just a few degrees off level and it shuts down, so you pretty much have to keep it at the same level as the target that your aiming it at..  :(  Final opinion: A good value for the price /size.

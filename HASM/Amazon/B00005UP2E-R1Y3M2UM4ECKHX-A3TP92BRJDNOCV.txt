Title: Nice little vacuum for the money
Content:
The low price and good reviews are what lead me to buy this vacuum.  It is lightweight, does a good job on hard floors. The suction for carpets doesn't seem that great - it does not pick up any lint on my area rugs.  If you have mostly hard flooring, then this is a good pick. Would not recommend for carpets though.

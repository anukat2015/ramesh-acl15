Title: I purchased 2
Content:
Bought one a week ago and another this week - it was on sale. Went to open up first one and the entire front was pulled off from the radiator. Thought about putting it back but decided to send back. I just went through this with another radiator from amazon - the Solaris (that was returned because it is a piece of crap!).  I used to like Amazon but this return process in a pain.  I suggest you shop around your neighborhood

Title: Worst coffee maker I ever owned.
Content:
From day one, this coffee maker took 30-40 minutes to brew a whole pot.  It sputtered and coughed and squealed so badly that it would wake us up from its spot in the kitchen 60' from the bedroom.  When it was almost done brewing it sound like the space shuttle achieving liftoff, then beep to tell us it was done, which we already knew by the blessed silence!
I tried cleaning it many times, thinking it was scale, even though it did this when new, but to no avail.
The other problems (hard to see the water level when filling, steam billowing out all over the cabinets above) are minor compared to the fact that the thing just didn't work properly, ever.
You'll notice the whole review is in past tense... before just chucking it I took it apart to see if I could identify, if not fix, the problem.  No dice. It went in the trash after only a few months of less-than-daily use.
To be fair, the carafe is the best ever, and I kept it and use it to pour coffee from my new machine into because it keeps the coffee hot ALL DAY.  If I were rating the carafe alone I'd give it 5 stars!  But this was a lot to pay for a thermal carafe.
I really wanted this machine to be great, because it was a rare 12-cup thermal and a good brand.  It's my own fault for not returning it when I had the chance, but I thought I was doing something wrong... but what can you possibly do wrong with a coffeemaker?  If you can't buy a Cuisinart and expect it to work, it really narrows the field.  Sad.

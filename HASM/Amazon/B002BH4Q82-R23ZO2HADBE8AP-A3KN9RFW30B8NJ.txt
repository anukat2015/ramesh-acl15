Title: A big punch for a reasonable price
Content:
I think the specs of this machine really speak for themselves, and when you put them beside the price, your getting the power of a high end laptop, at the price of the more modest options available.
The design, weight, and functionality of this laptop is really top notch and will keep you playing even high end games for years to come.  I've been hesitant to buy HP computers in the past, but I just could not pass up the chance to get a machine like this when it was the only one of it's caliber in my price range.  I was not disappointed.
My only beef is that the shiny black finish and the metallic touch pad show fingerprints often and clearly.  But the beautiful wide screen and comfortable keyboard more than make up for such a minor design flaw.
Really a good machine AND a good deal.

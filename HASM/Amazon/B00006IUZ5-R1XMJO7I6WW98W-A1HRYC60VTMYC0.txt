Title: Works great!!
Content:
I've had mine for at least 5 years -- I keep it at my desk at work and use it 5 days a week at least once a day.
It provides me with hot water on demand -- boiling hot and ready for my tea or instant coffee.
And other than a pesky leak (after 4 years) which can be offset by lightly jiggling the dispense handle -- it works just fine and does what it's expected to.
It's also great to have at home by the kitchen sink to make hot water instead of leaving a pot to boil and then forgetting it, when you run off to work (aagh!)

Title: Great Machine With Design Flaws!
Content:
Lighten up fans of this product, it makes good coffee but it's not flawless. Yes, small pouring mouth in the back is a design flaw and who ever designed it should be made to pour water for all of us! Had a Braun Coffee maker and it was very easy to pour and its hinged filter basket was better designed. I make small batches on daily basis so it does a fine job, except once, when I made a 12 cup batch and the grinds did backup to the spray head. I roast my own beans and fancy myself as a connoisseur of coffee, so I know my coffee machine and this aint flawless! The itsy bitsy water filter barely last a month, whereas a decent size filter should last at least 3 months!

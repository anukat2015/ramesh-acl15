Title: Misleading Description
Content:
The product arrived as expected, however it took a couple of days of powering the product to eliminate the obnoxious smell.  I purchased this for my daughters room after reading the description as "safe for small children" however it actually reads "safer" for small children.  While my daughter is still young (4 mo), she would ABSOLUTELY burn herself on this unit.  We will use this while she is not mobile, and likely have to discard it based on safety concerns alone once she is mobile.  If you do not have small children at home this is a good option, otherwise you need to keep children away from the product to avoid the burning risks.

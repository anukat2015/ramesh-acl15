Title: Great machine - Fantastic for audio workstation
Content:
This is my fist ASUS and I couldn't be happier. No negatives with the i7, 7200rpm Hard Drive, USB 3.0, virtually no bloatware (Trial of MS Office & Trend Micro Antivirus), great support, hard drive setup with 3 partitions (Express Gate, Windows 7 OS, data), runs quiet and is lighter than I expected.
Got it mainly to process audio (Ableton Live Suite 8) and was a bit concerned how everything would run on Win7 / i7, but I had no problems.
It's run everything I've thrown at it without hesitation.

Title: Zune 8GB Review
Content:
I have tried several different MP3 players, Sansa comes to mind and I really like their hardware but the software was extremely frustrating. Finally MS comes out with the Zune and their music managing software, while very basic finally does what I want it to do, not what some programmer thinks I want to do. Now you can create a playlist, move that playlist to your Zune and play all or part of it. Other devices force your music into different catagories, like Genre, Artist etc. Seems to have good battery life. The touchpad is a little sensitive to use. The back button is a separate key and not on the touchpad like most, otherwise a decent product.

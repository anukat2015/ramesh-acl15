Title: Worst vacuum on the market!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Content:
I bought this cute little vacuum, and after absolutely hating it for nearly one year, I have junked it. First of all, it is very loud. Second, wildly flimsy. Beyond that all the tools fall off while you use it! Even the main floor attachment. To make this more aggravating, the actual hoses (the metal ones) fall off each other! It also has a flip brush option for carpet/hardwood. When you flip it into position, it just flips right back when you begin your task!
If I hadn't immediately thrown away all the packaging, I would have returned it. 
Please dont waste your money on this piece of crap. I am sooooo surprised that hoover actually has not pulled it! I would never buy any hoover again.

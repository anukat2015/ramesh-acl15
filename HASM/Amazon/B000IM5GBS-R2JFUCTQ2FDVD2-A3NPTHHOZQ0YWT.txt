Title: Great Mp3 Player (for geeks)
Content:
For the price there isn't a lot that can beat the Sansa c240.  I bought it because it has a MicroSD slot. (extensible memory is great) The FM Radio, Picture Viewer, and Voice Recorder aren't all that great, but they're fun extras.
Speaking of fun extras, the biggest boon to the c240 is it's ability to run RockBox [www.rockbox.org] as custom firmware. This is a bit geeky for most users, but since the original interface is horrible, it might be worth a try.  You'll find that your c240 is much more powerful than you thought it could be.
With RockBox you can watch videos, play games, skin the interface, run simple programs, and still have all the original functions (radio/voice) intact. The biggest limitation is it's screen. At 132x80 you really can't do a lot with it. If you want to show off to your iPod using friends, just show them how your mp3 player can run DOOM.
I adore my c240 running RockBox, but here's why it's still a 3 star. RockBox is an add-on and isn't terribly easy to get started on. The original interface is horrible. The screen is tiny and lo-res. The USB cord is custom and replacing it isn't cheap.
Nonetheless, I love my new Sansa c240.  If you're geek who loves to customize your electronics then you will love it.  If you aren't then you might want to pass.

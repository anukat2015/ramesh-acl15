Title: D3K great value
Content:
After using the Nikon D3000 for about a month, and over 500 pictures, I can only report that it is worth every nickel of it's price ($500 on 12/4/09). 
1. Easy to use.
2. controls well laid out
3. Kit lens AF quick and silent.
4. Size reasonable for small hands (mine).
5. Ability to take Nikon 'F' mount lenses (AF or not).
While there is the occasional 'oops' moment, errors are easily corrected, and, of course, being digital, errors deleted with no expense incurred. Can't say that about film cameras.
In addition to the kit lens, I have bought from a friend his Sigma 70-300 lens. While it is designated as an AF lens, as it does not have it's own motor, it isn't on the D3K. Manual focusing is a bit of a pain, as is having to learn how to do it all over again. But when I get it right WOW! Nice crisp image.
The only real criticism is not about the camera itself, a star performer. It is that lack of a REAL manual. The 60 page 'manual' merely highlights the cameras' many controls and menus and does not go into detail about them. The Main manual is a  216 page PDF  file loaded onto a PC and called a Reference manual. I call it the Users Manual, and the little 60 page thing a Quick Reference. The 'Dummys' book I bought on the D3K has a lot of useful information but having a PRINTED manual would have been better than having to buy my own hard copy.

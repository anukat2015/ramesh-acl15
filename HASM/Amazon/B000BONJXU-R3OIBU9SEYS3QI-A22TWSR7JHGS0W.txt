Title: nice little player
Content:
i got this free with earbuds i bought at amazon. it held 97 songs for me. easy to use after i played around with it(did not come with manual but was easy enough to figure out.) works well..not alot of frills like the creative zen or ipod graphics, but then not much on it that can go wrong either. i liked it well enough that i am buying my son the 4 gig sansa, since he is on his 3rd dell dj(made by creative) and the ipods get bad reviews.

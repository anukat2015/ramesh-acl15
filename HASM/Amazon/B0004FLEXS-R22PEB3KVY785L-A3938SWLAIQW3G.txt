Title: You Can't Go Wrong With This Best Buy Brewer!
Content:
If you, like me, tend to agonize over purchases like this because you're just not sure you're making the right decision, do yourself a favor, save yourself some time (and angst), and just BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER! Devote your research energies to another project, because you won't find a better value. This smart-looking Black & Decker does exactly what it promises. It has all the features you need and none you don't. I particularly love the fact that, unlike much more expensive brewers I've owned, it truly is "dripless" -- if you want/need that first cup before the brewing process is completely finished, just grab the carafe and pour with confidence, imbued with the knowledge that not a single drop of java will wind up anywhere but in your cup. Yes, we can land a man on the moon AND develop a cheap yet impressively competent coffeemaker!

Title: Was thrilled with heater until it DIED
Content:
We live in an old, VERY drafty house and I get cold easily. Bought this to use on my side of the bed in the winter, and unfortunately, it only lasted just over One season...Yes, there was a smell the first couple of times you use it, but it goes away. It puts out a lot of heat, it's light, and I wasn't able to see much of a difference on our electric bill, even with daily use for several months. This year I pulled it out to use and it worked great until last night. Turned it on and it started sparking and looked like it was going to catch on fire. Conveniently enough for Delonghi, it's four months past the warranty date.
I really liked that the heater was silent, worked good enough to heat our entire bedroom so we didn't have to heat the rest of the house, and heated fast enough to just warm my cold toes. I'm really bummed now and will now have to look for an alternative option. Obviously I won't be buying another one of these. I expected it to last at least another year or so.

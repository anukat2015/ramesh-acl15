Title: Room Heater a little loud
Content:
I got this unit for my basement approx 14 x 30'.  It does keep the basement a nice temperature - set the thermostat - nice!  BUT the fan became quite loud.  Not bad with the TV on, but is somewaht distracting when it is quiet.  Good for the price, however could be designed to operate more quietly.

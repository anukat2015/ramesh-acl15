Title: Too fragile.  One little drop on kitchen linoleum and Poof, its gone!
Content:
I wrote a great review on this little bean 2 days ago.  
I am now editing it.
For some reason it wont let me change the amount of stars I gave it. I would now give it 1 star.
The darn thing just broke on me.  It slipped out of my fingers and actually gently hit the floor ( the cord breaking some of the fall ) and the control stick broke off and the thing is almost useless now.
I really think that a mp3 flash player should be more durable.  This stinks, I wasted 120 dollars.  
Time to get an ipod.

Title: ASUS UL30A-A2
Content:
I really like this notebook.  Great display, fast processor, great keyboard and the best notebook battery life I've ever had.  I saw some complaints about the touch pad, but it has been fine for me.  The Windows 7 networks very well with my Vista-loaded desktop as well.  If it travels well for several years I'll be a very happy camper.

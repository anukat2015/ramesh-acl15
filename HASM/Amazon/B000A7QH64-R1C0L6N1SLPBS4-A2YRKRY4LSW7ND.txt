Title: Great little handheld vac
Content:
I have three cats and as you might imagine, they leave a lot of hair behind. This little hand held vacuum does the trick for quick vacuuming of my stairs and furniture. If you don't know anything about ni-cad (Nickel Cadmium) batteries then you will probably not know how to take care of them properly. 
Lithium-Ion batteries are the latest technology on the market for batteries. They are designed to run with full output until the end of their charge then quickly die. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries slowly lose power as you discharge them but you can recharge them at any point. Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) are different. You have to "COMPLETELY" discharge them each time before recharging, otherwise they get what is commonly called as "memory". This basically means they wont hold as much charge. What I do after vacuuming each time and running my batteries down, is just let the power switch on and fully discharge the batteries completely. Then I put it back on the charger. In order to clean it up after each use, I go out in to my shop and take my compressed air line and blow out the filter, the canister where the vacuumed up stuff ends up, and the little beater bar.

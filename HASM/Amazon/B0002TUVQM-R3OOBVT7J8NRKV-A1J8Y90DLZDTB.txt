Title: This machine is wonderful!
Content:
I love this machine! It's so easy to use and does everything for you....all you need to do is mix in your hot chocolate (or other ingredients) and your milk or water. That's it - in a few minutes you will have a delicious drink! There's also a book with recipes for different drinks - there are a lot of great recipes and I haven't even tried them yet because I'm so happy with the regular hot cocoa drink so far. This machine doesn't take up too much space and is fairly easy to clean. I do wish it could be put into the dishwasher...but other than that it is perfect! I would definitely recommend this and would buy it again.

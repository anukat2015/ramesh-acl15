Title: Very nice heater, period
Content:
looked around for heaters and thought this one had a nice design and it fits our family needs.  We have a young toddler who wants to touch everything right now)- heater doesn't get hot to the touch or at least the plastic around main frame doesn't. The vent itself blows hot air so he's not interested in getting too close to it.  The remote is also fantastic- being able to control whether it oscilates or not remotely is great (in addition to the temperature of course).

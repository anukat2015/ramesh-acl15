Title: Don't Buy Electrolux's Oxygen Canister Vacuum!
Content:
What a nightmare Electrolux's Oxygen canister vacuum is. Soon after we got it, the hose began spitting out junk because the light alerting you that the bag was full never went on. The entire wand was stuffed full, and it was almost impossible to get it out.
We should have known it was a lemon then. But no, we had to wait five months after our purchase for another piece to break connecting the wand to the beater. And lo, Electrolux couldn't even get a replacement part to our vendor because I guess its Chinese factory didn't have any on hand. It's been over six weeks and we still don't have the vacuum repaired, despite talking to Vanessa, Adam and Brenda of Electrolux. We demanded a refund for this lemon but all we heard from them is it is not their problem.
Well it is their problem because anyone who buys this machine is making a big mistake. Don't buy Electrolux's Oxygen Canister Vacuum!

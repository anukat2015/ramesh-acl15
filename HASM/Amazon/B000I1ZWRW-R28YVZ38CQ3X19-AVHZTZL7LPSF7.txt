Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi
Content:
What can I say, I love Canon cameras.  Deciding to buy this camera wasn't a big deal because I knew I wanted Canon & I already had Canon lenses that I used with my film camera.  It works great & takes beautiful shots.  Since I already own a rebel, getting used to the options was not difficult because they are not that different.  The display is nice & big. I haven't used the dust cleaner app on it yet because I haven't needed to, but I did play around with other settings & have had a ball.  Some people have complained about the images being too dark...I think it may be a preference or just particular settings.  Just like any camera, you need to make adjustments to get the image the way you want. At any rate, I really like it, but I'm still not ready to give up my film cameras.

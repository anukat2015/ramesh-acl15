Title: HORRIBLE VACUUM
Content:
I purchased this vacuum because I have mostly hardwood floors and thought the power nozzle would work better than a floor brush. Was I wrong!!! The nozzle has no suction without the rug power on and that only pushes the dust and particles to another spot.  The tiny floor attachment is what I end up using and it takes me twice as long to vacuum.  Also, the attachment holder which doesn't keep the atttachemnets in place, keeps you from getting under beds and tight areas, the reason I prefer a canister.  I think it is also cheaply made machine.  The first time I changed the bag the clip broke.  There is also an irritating high pitched screach the vacuum makes that makes this a horrible little machine.  I wish I had researched this a little better and perhaps seen it in person before I purchased it.  I don't recommend this to anyone!!

Title: VH101
Content:
My VH101 personal heater works great.  However, shortly after running it for several hours it started to make a "clicking" sound which is very annoying.  I emailed Vornado customer service about the problem and never heard back from them.  We own a couple of other Vornado products that have performed well for us for many many years.  Those units were made in USA.  The VH101 was made in China.  Even with the annoying "clicking" sound, I recommend the VH101.

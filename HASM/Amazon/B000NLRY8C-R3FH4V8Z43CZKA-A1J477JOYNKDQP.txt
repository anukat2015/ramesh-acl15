Title: I love my coffee pot!
Content:
I have owned this coffee pot for a year and a half and I still absolutely love it. It is in the same shape now as it was brand new. I can adjust the temperature of the coffee warmer plate so that when I go back for a second cup it's not scalding hot. I can also adjust the brew strength and I think that reduces the amount of coffee I use for each pot, which is thrifty and a plus in my book. The cleaning cycle is nice, I just put some vinegar in, fill it up with water, and it cleans itself. I've never used the delay brew but I think that's a great feature for people that want thier coffee waiting for them when they wake up. It will beep when the coffee is done brewing or you can turn that feature off if you want. And I really like that once it's done brewing it times how long the coffee has been sitting there. Also, I always grab a cup before the pot is finished brewing and there is no mess or spilling. I have no issues filling the water reservoir either. The brew basket is removable so you can pull it out and wash it real good. The pot is very attractive, mine is black and red, and the clock is indeglo which I like.  I don't use the chlorine filter because I don't want to buy replacements, but that's just my personal preference and the coffee brews just fine without it. I highly recommend this coffee pot!

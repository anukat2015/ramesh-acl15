Title: Glad I bought this great camera from Amazon.com
Content:
I am so glad I bought this camera from Amazon.com.  The camera is top notch of course, but when I bought this camera it was selling for $794 on Amazon.  Within 12 days, the price dropped to $709.  With Amazon's price guarantee, I was refunded the $84 difference.  Not even Newegg does that.  Thanks Amazon!
The camera is just what I expected from Canon.  It's easy to use, even in my novice hands.  There are some functions that I still need to get a handle on but that's just my inexperience showing through.  I bought the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens from Amazon as well and couldn't be happier with the results.  I would  highly recommend that purchase to any newbies out there that like to take portraits.

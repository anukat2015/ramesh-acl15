Title: worst experience ever
Content:
out of the box it won't recognize wi fi devices. four hours with Kodak printer techs to find out this conmputer won't find it. Works okay on home wi fi internet, not with Quicksilver USB AT&T or others. All similar wifi devices were found and gtrouble free when hooked up to HP desktop with XP. These same devices worked well with my Gateway laptop too. Have to call Toshiba for an explanation when I have more hours to waste, very disappointed with my first Toshiba machine.

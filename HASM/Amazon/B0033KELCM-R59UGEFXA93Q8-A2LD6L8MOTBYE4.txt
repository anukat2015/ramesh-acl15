Title: Excellent student computer
Content:
I purchased this laptop in Jan. 2010, and I've been using it ever since. It has never crashed before, it works efficiently with Windows 7, and it operates very quietly. Since I don't use it for gaming, the graphics card is sufficient for my purposes. The Compaq is solidly built and extremely durable. - would recommend to anyone.

Title: Awesome!!!
Content:
I bought this coffee machine three years ago and it has preformed flawlessly! It brews the best coffee (I use Starbucks beans and keep them fresh in my freezer in a of of the new Reynolds air tight bags) I will say that this machine is not for the super lazy people. It does take about 2-3 minutes to clean and should be cleaned immediately after brewing coffee. There really isn't much else to say, except that you will not find a better machine anywhere!

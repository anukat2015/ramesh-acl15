Title: My First Review EVER.
Content:
Piece of garbage.
(side note: the first one that got sent to me leaked water everywhere; I sent it back and received a working unit)
It's as if someone designed this thing aiming specifically for annoyance and inconvenience.
The manual is full of contradictions and outright lies; the unit needs draining far more than they suggest and the process is the most ridiculous thing I've ever tried to do.
The drainage spout is located about a half inch off the ground and the manual suggests that you not move the unit while it's full (I don't know exactly how much water it holds, but it takes a loooong time to drain).
This forces you to do one of two things; spend an hour filling up and emptying the tiny little tray they give you, or come up with some of your own creative and time saving drainage methods because you WILL have to drain this thing every 4-6 hours.
Plus, this unit is massive and a HUGE pain in the ass to move unless you can roll it to wherever you're emptying it.
That being said, if you can rig up a way for it to drain continuously, it works like a charm.

Title: great all around laptop
Content:
this computer has pretty much everthing you could ask for out of a laptop the amd vision dual core processor coupled with the 256 dedicated video ram makes running everything smooth and fast with great graphics from high def youtube to high graphic running games like modern warfare 2 this computer does it all i got mine @ best buy for $479.00 but i seen they lowered the price now to 439.00 so you cant get more computer for that amount. this has been best buy's best selling laptop for a good reason you simply cant go wrong with it. the only bad things i can say about it is the battery life is pretty low , and like most laptop's the keys are kinda cramped

Title: Overall not bad
Content:
overall this vaccum worked well and did the job. It pick-up almost everthing in my car fairly easily, despite a few very small pieces.The tools that they give with it arent really good and do not work as well as the vaccum itself.However, I would definitly reccomend this to someone who doesnt want to spend a fortune on a car vaccum.But if your willing to spend a lot of money im sure the 16 volt black and decker vaccum may be better.

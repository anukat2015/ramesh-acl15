Title: Making Coffee is Fun!
Content:
I bought the Keurig B70 shortly before we had guests in our home for a week.  It was great!  Anyone could have coffee any time they wanted, including hot cocoa for the children.  The only minus is the different coffee cup sizes.  I made a couple of travel mugs for my husband and myself with a dark roast coffee.  It had some flavor of the darker roast, but because more water was added to the same K-cup, it was a weak cup of coffee.  I think using 2 K-cups on the smallest cup size would be best for the travel mug.

Title: Great product, so far so good
Content:
Had the unit for a little over a month and no real problems except for
crashing once in a while while connected to wi-fi. Battery takes very long to charge initially (even with the dvr unit) so be patient 
Awesome video quality and touch screen works well. Very easy to use and set-up was pretty simple. Could use a slot for the stylus in the future.
Get the DVR as well and you will be able to record directly from cable/etc.
Dragging and dropping files is also a breeeze. No real issues except for the occasional crash/freeze with wi-fi

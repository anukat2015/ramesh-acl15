Title: not good
Content:
Computer gets very warm on the bottom and would not sync up with our wireless router-called Dell SEVERAL times-got cut off (hung up on "accidentally"?) three times and had to start over again. Customer service in India kept passing me off to different people until finally, got hung up on again. As soon as you say you want to send it back to Dell, they don't care about you. At one point I was told that for a fee they could help me connect to the internet! Alas, I am packing it up and sending it back from whence it came! I wish I could write about the features but I only had it for 3 days and couldn't get online so I can't coment. Dell Customer Care leaves much to be desired-NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY DELL!!

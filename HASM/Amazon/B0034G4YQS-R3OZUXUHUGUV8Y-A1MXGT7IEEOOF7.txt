Title: Great purchase!
Content:
This is a great laptop for the PRICE. After my $1000 HP DV9820US 17" laptop died after 21 months, I spent hours looking for a great laptop at a cheap price.  I have had it for two weeks now and I am pleased with the purchase.  Nice wide screen (wider than my HP) and very lightweight - a little plastic-like/thin, but seems sturdy enough to hold up in the long run. Super fast, resolution is OK, and good sound quality.  CONS: Like one other reviewer mentioned, the only major negative is that the power plug slips out fairly often... you would think they would have noticed that flaw.  I also agree that the power lights in the front are very bright and annoying, but I am getting used to it (either that or I am going blind).

Title: Awesome!
Content:
Fantastic! I've owned a few generations of iPods, iPhones, etc. I purchased this one to use with the H2O water device so I could swim to music. Well, I've found this little Shuffle has become a steady companion, especially in the gym where it is so light weight and stays out of the way. Another terrific Apple product.

Title: Be warned
Content:
The product wasn't the version (shape) that was described.  I didn't find the particular version a problem, I simply had to purchase alternate accessories, which was a Christmas morning bummer.  The main problem was that a channel was blown (only one side was producing music.)  I'm still in the process of returning it so I cannot comment on the return process.
Be warned - your refurbished ipod may not be all you expect.

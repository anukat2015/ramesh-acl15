Title: Eco Heater
Content:
I installed this heater last weekend. It was relatively easy to install even though it's slightly heavy (similar to shelving, etc).  I have a 1200 SF house (2 floors) and I installed this on one of my living room walls (approx. 120 SF).  
And while it hasn't gotten below about 30 degrees at night yet, the heater takes the edge off.  I won't know how well it keeps up until later in the season but I am hopeful.  I will probably need at least one more unit to heat the remainder of the downstairs.
I couldn't find many reviews but decided to give it a try and so far I'm pleased.

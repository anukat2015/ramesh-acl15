We now have 4 of these little vacs.  Have 1 in each bathroom and 1 in the kitchen.  Works well and easy to clean.  Keep in mind these are small hand vacs for small quick pick ups.  It not designed to be your full size vac.  For those small purposes it works great.  We bought our first one about 3 yrs ago and we still use it.  The battery no longer holds as long of a charge but, its still usable.  Still like this product better than any others I've used in other homes.

Title: Didn't serve my purpose
Content:
It might work in the places where there is dry heat but in place where there is humidity it is useless it makes room more humid and unbearable; didn't work for me at all. I bought it for my son who just got an apartment without an A/C and we did put ice and water just as the instructions say but didn't work instead made room more humid.I don't know what to do its not worth the money.
I am really upset as it should say that it won't work in places where there is humidity.

Title: Nikon's Best Deal
Content:
A lot has already been said about this camera, so there is no point in going into technical details again.  This camera is for the photographer who wants to tinker with his photos, to grow into and learn new tricks with her SLR.  A good compromise between lower models like the D70 and D40, and top models like the D2X, etc.  This might be "too much camera" for the individual who simply wants to shoot, but if you want to be able to grow with your art, to experiment as your skills mature, the D200 will be certainly able to keep up with you.
Durable construction, handles the elements well.  Mine has spent more than its share of time in steamy, rainy jungles.  Its white balance settings, etc. really allow a high level of customization in your photography.  Shoot images that are as soft or vivid, cold or warm as you want them to be.
Those who are unused to, or have forgotten what it is like to hold a full-size SLR should note that the D200 has some heft to it.  It's not overly heavy, but veteran SLR shooters will find it reassuring while novices might be surprised by it.  It is noticeably heavier than a D70, etc.
If you are having trouble deciding on this camera, understand that it is well worth the money, providing that you want something beyond just taking pictures.  The D200 is like an artist's paintbrush- it allows you to follow the possibilities of your mind.

Title: Good Design but Hard to Start
Content:
Not easy to get started, but great once you get it going. toasty.  I have 2 CO detectors just in case the low O2 sensors fail.  Low O2 results in incomcombustion which results in higher levels of CO.  Alright old man winter, Im ready for ya. Bring it on!

Title: Great canister vac
Content:
I was used to using canister vacs and found it hard using uprights. This is a wonderful canister vac. All the attachments are quite useful. The buttons are close at hand and it isuser friendly. It does a very good job. It is everything I epected and wanted. I would strongly reccommend this vac to anyone desiring a canister vacuum that has the power and suction of a motorized head.

Title: Hoover Quality???
Content:
I purchased this vacuum in January of 2009 because of all the good reviews; it is now 14 months later and I'm finding out that considering how much I paid for this Hoover, the quality is terrible. The suction was never really that great and now the controls sometimes don't work. Are Hoovers only good to last a little more than a year (right after the one-year warranty ends)? I liked the idea of a bagless vacuum, but I had to clean it out every other week. I would NOT recommend this product because I think for the money you pay for this vacuum, it should have better suction and last more than 14 months.
Update on 3/20/2010:  I took the vacuum to a Hoover repair center and they said it was a problem with the electronics in the on/off/floor/carpet switches.  I asked him how much to fix the controls and he said Hoover only sells the whole hose assembly as a unit, not by the control parts....cost $130!!! half of what the vacuum costs and only 14 months of use.  Not purchasing another Hoover canister again.

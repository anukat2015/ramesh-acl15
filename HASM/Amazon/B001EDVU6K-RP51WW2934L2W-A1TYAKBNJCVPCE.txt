Title: accurate to within .5 degrees, plus or minus
Content:
This heater is extremely accurate in maintaing the set temp.  I have tested it several times against a digital thermometer with memory.  With each test, the heater has maintained the set temp. to within .5 degrees, plus or minus of the set temp.  These tests have been conducted on 8 hr. time frames.  
The remote is very easy to use & is an impt. upgrade, because it allows you to place the sensing device @ any location in the room away from the heater.  This gives a much more accurate temp. throughout the room.  
The air circulation ability of the vornado heaters is pretty amazing.  it really circulates the air throughout the room as advertised.  It works slow but effectively.  
The heater has been used for probably 48 hrs. of run time.  Hopefully, it is durable enough to maintain its current performance over many yrs.  
I have two of the vornado VH2 heaters which both failed during the 1st winter of moderate use.  I purchased the EH1 heater only after learning that Vornado will pay shipping to return the two VH2 heaters to the factory for free warranty repair & will ship back to me @ no cost.  The EH1 also has the free return policy but has a 2 yr. instead of the 1 yr. warranty found on the VH2. Warranty info. that came with the VH2 & EH1 all state that the customer has to pay to ship the product back to the factory and then include $20 for them to ship it back to you.  this is basically a worthless warranty and in my call to Vornado, they said that they now pay shipping both ways on all of their heaters.

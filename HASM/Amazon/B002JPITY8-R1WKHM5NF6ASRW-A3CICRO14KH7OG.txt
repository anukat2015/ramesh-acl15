Title: no digital copy playback
Content:
argh, should've done my research... was looking for a new player (zune hd vs. ipod touch) and even planned on RMA'ing this, but the price dropped close to the touch so i kept it. 
mainly i wanted it for travel: tunes and watching digital copies of movies i haven't had a chance to view yet. well, after transferring the first digital copy to my computer, i was surprised to see it wasn't showing up in my video collection in the zune software... a quick google let me know the zune is not a 'plays for sure' device and therefore won't play these drm video files.
my fault for not looking it up, but i never would've thought that a new media player wouldn't play these, especially after transferring other copies for my kid to his nano. 
the player itself is great, just thought some others might want to know this info before making a decision.

Title: Great grind and brew coffeemaker
Content:
I just bought this coffeemaker to replace my grind and brew Cuisinart which was a horrible grind and brew machine.  The Capresso makes an outstanding cup of coffee and is very easy to use. The beans remain dry and the burr grinder is superior to other coffee grinders on the market.
This coffee maker has everything you need, thermal carafe, water filter, burr grinder and auto feature which allows you to have the perfect pot of coffee ready at a pre programmed time. I like the size of this machine it takes up less counter space than previous models.

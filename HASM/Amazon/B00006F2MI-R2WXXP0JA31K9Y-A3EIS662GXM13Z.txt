Title: Total waste of money and never hot enough
Content:
I got this machine as a wedding shower gift and feel horrible that I am going to return it but I HATE IT.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and while I have not had any leaks or experienced the door popping open, the coffee simply is not warm enough.  I get up when I hear the grinder (how can you avoid hearing that???) and take a shower, dress, etc. and by the time I get to the kitchen, it's cold.  I found myself rushing through my morning routine to get to the coffee while it was hot - who's in charge here?  Finally last night after cleaning all the parts again (which was another dissapointment that it is more work than I expected, frankly), I finally chose to stop the madness and brought out my old Hamilton-Beech.  This morning?  Hot coffee all morning.  Back to the store for the Cuisinart!

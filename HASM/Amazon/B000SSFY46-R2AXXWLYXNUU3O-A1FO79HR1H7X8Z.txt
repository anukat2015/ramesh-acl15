Title: Doesn't even power on!
Content:
Aaargh!!
The AFCI on the plug immediately trips when plugging the unit into the wall.  As a result it doesn't power on.  Haier support says that my outlets don't have enough amperage, but I tried it from both 15 and 20 amp outlets (with nothing else turned on or plugged in) and still no result.  It's a lot of fun dealing with a unit that's DOA.
I read that other brands of portable air conditioners have similar problems...the AFCI in the plug is way too sensitive.  Caveat emptor!

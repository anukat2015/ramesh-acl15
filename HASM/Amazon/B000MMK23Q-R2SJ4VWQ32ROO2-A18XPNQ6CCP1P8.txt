Title: Edenpure heater brought electric bills down!
Content:
The edenpure heater is far more economical than the, Vornado heater, we used 2 years back. It cost about half of what the Vornado did to operate. lower electric bills is the aim, so this heater gets a thumbs up. It does cost more than others, but if you look at the real cost, it has saved us far more than its initial cost in overall electric costs.
I would not even be hear wasting my time, but i am ordering a second one now.
Best,
John J.

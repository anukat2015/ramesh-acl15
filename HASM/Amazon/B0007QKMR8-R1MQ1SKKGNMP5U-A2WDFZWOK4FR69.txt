Title: Very Pleased
Content:
I've had the Rebel XT about a month and I'm very pleased with it.  I've probably shot at least 1,500 shots getting familiar with it.  
I have been very happy with both the A70 and A95 Canon cameras I also own, but the picture quality is really several cuts above the "A" series.  The fact that they all use the Compact Flash format cards sure doesn't hurt either.
I've read how some think the camera is a bit small in the hands, but I find it very comfortable.
I already have a couple of Canon film SLR's, so I was happy to be able to use my existing lenses.  However, one Canon film Rebel-compatible Quantaray lense does NOT work with the Digital Rebel XT.  The other Quantaray lense I have does.  Go figure!
Also, the external flash units are NOT interchangable with the film versions.  AND some Canon DSLR-compatible flash units do not work with the Rebel XT.  Read the fine print to be sure before you buy!  I think it's really worth it to invest in a decent external flash and a good one doesn't have to cost an obscene amount.
I've had no second thoughts about buying this camera.  The RAW format capability seems to draw out the very best in it, so make sure you have enough Compact Flash card capacity!

Title: Great value
Content:
Did a lot of research and I feel this camera is the best value for an entry level DSLR.  Keep in mind that you most likely will have to spent an additional $[...] for a memory card and rechargable batteries. My only complaint is that the shutter seems to be very loud.  As well, I have a problem when using the menu and Fn features that the LCD screen displays will just go dark before I'm finished with changing the features.  I've emailed Pentax to see if this is a common problem.  Overall, very happy with this camera.

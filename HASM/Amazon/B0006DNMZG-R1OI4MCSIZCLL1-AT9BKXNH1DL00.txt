Title: Completely met the need
Content:
For 23 bucks it was completely worth it.  It heats the room we are in so much that we went from halfway up on the dial to less then that.  We have still not found the perfect setting but it consistently keeps us warm at night.  It is noisy about as much so as our air conditioner.  Do not get this if you mind white noise as it will bother the hell out of you.  My SO needed something to sleep through the night and this met that need.  She now no longer complains about being cold unless we do not turn it on.

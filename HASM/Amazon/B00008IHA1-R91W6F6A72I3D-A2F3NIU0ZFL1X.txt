Title: Read carefully- it is made of aluminum
Content:
It says it right there- polished aluminum.  I did not pay attention when I read the description.  I purchased if for my office, but several people did not want to drink from it for fear of aluminum poisoning (which is reputed to cause damage to your nervous system).  I can't say if this fear is well founded, but I didn't want to drink from it either.  Now it just sits there and we purchased a Kurig cup at a time maker that we use daily. (The Kurig gets 5-starts btw.)

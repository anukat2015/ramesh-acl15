Title: Out of the box review
Content:
I have the 1st generation Nano & now this one.  Since this is an "out of the box review", my comments are referring strictly to that.  
First, I don't notice a big difference in the display.
Second, since I use the Nano for running, I like the Apple iPod plastic "tubes" that (hopefully) keep moisture from the Nano.  Although every site that sells the tubes (pack of 5, ~$30 for a blue, green, white, pink & purple one) says they are only for 1st gen Nanos, they fit 2nd gen Nanos perfectly.  In fact, 2nd gen Nanos have an "edge" (I'm hip to these things since I'm clumsy & tend to hurt myself without really trying!) and the plastic tubes make that a non issue.    Of course, the colors of the tubes matter.  I bought the pink (translate MAGENTA) Nano and the white, pink & purple tubes look great.  I kind of like the green & blue tubes on my pink (MAGENTA) Nano, too, but you have to appreciate the neon/offsetting colors thing to do so.  LOL!  
Anyway, don't let anyone dissuade you that you must buy a 2nd gen Nano cover.  The 1st gen ones work fine.
UPDATE:  5/19/08 - I know this Nano is EOL (end of life) but did want to mention I still love both my first & second gen Nanos.  I DO notice a difference in the battery life between the two.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm a runner.  When using the 1st gen Nano, I have to be sure to juice it up before each run.  The 2nd gen Nano can cover two days, depending upon circumstances.

Title: It's giving me some problems
Content:
When I graduated high school back in 2005, a family member gave me an iPod Mini as a gift.  The battery died in the spring of 2008, which I temporarily replaced with one of those cheap do-it-yourself kits while waiting out until the holiday season to ask for an upgrade (college kids have no money).  With about 5,500 songs in my library, I had also ran out of room on the old player, so I thought the Classic was the best deal for what I needed in GB.
So, I've had the 80 GB iPod Classic Black for about 6 months now, and I wish I could say that I'm happy with the upgrade.  My number one problem:  songs keep going missing!  I upload or download music to my library, but for some reason it never transfers to the iPod when I sync the system.  Or sometimes, just as annoying, the artist names don't show up, but I can find their album.
I've also had some issues with stalling.  Sometimes the volume locks and refuses to move, and I occasionally have the same problem while scrolling through the menu.
I'm happy that I now have an iPod that can hold my entire library (minus the aforementioned missing tracks), but I can't completely get past the assortment of issues.  One thing that I do love about this player is how quickly it charges.  Plug it in and it's ready in about two hours (much better than the older models).  
Let this review act as a bit of a buyer beware.  You may have some of the same issues I've encountered, or maybe I just got a semi-lemon.  Weighing the positives and negatives, I'd probably give it 3.5 stars.

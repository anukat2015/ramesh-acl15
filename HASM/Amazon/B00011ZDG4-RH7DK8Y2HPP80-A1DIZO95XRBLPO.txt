Title: i love it!
Content:
this is my fourth or fifth thinkpad and my second in the &quot;X&quot; line (previously i owned an X21). i love it, i simply love it. i've used it under windows, BSD, and Linux and it's flawless under all of them. the built-in wireless works as advertised, and gets great range and reception. too bad it's only 802.11b, but i will make do.the built in ports (USB, firewire, VGA) are useful and superb, especially for meetings and travelling. the built-in CF slot is awesome for getting pics off of my camera.the unit's size and weight are perfect for stashing in my bag as i hope on a plane or even just ride my bike to work.battery life under my settings (dimmed screen, speed stepped processor) hovers around 4 hours. about what you would expect for a model like this. the extended life battery that bolts onto the bottom brings battery life up to over 10 hours. [note, the extra lift battery is not included with this purchase. reccomended for long distance travellers, however.]the keyboard and mouse are perfect for day to day use, i've never been happier with a system. i never feel cramed or pained after using it.not having a CD or floppy drive is rarely an issue, most of us don't use it that often. network shares or a USB drive work well.all in all a great laptop. it's sturdy, lightweight, and great for travelling or using as a main system.

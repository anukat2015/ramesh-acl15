Title: Great for quick & easy and for the more detailed among us
Content:
We bought this camera one day before a big vacation.  I would have been happy with my tiny 6mp, but my husband was determined to move up.  His pictures were WONDERFUL.  Clearly we did not have time to explore all it could do in advance, but the 3,000 pictures we shot are amazing.  Whether a detailed picture trying to capture centuries old stained glass or my quick shots out of the car window, the end results are priceless.  You can blow up the image to look at single threads on a tapestry without the image suffering.  WOW.  Have memory ready though!  We had our laptop and were able to dump the 2GB card daily.  Really need a bigger card.

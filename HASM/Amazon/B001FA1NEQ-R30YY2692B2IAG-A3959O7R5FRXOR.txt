Title: iTunes sucks
Content:
I love my iPod, it is a superior product.  What I hate is the iTunes program.  I use my iPod only for podcasts. Using it for podcasts seemed very easy for the first few weeks.  Then iTunes started loosing my podcast subscriptions and all downloads.  After a few months and after setting up the subscriptions four times, I gave up on iPod altogether.  I don't know anyone who deosn't complain about the iTunes program.  Why can't they make a decent program.  The program has other problems that I learned to live with, but losing subscriptions and previous downloads was too much.

Title: Lasko Ceramic Heater
Content:
I purchased the Lasko heater and was quite surprised at the quality of the unit.  The heater is lightweight and attractive.  It does an excellent job heating a 12x18 room.  The thermostat is accurate and the automatic on/off works well.  Although it does not take the place of an open room that has no other heat it does heat quite well in conjunction with a heated home.  I have noticed that my furnace does not kick on as often while this heater is on.

Title: No regrets,,, awesome camera
Content:
I did a lot of research before switching from Pentax to Canon. I have several friends who shoot with the 30D and love them,, but this has much more to offer. The 40D did not get great reviews from my professional friends, which meant a lot to me. I stayed away from the 40D after reading too many forums with negitive comments on DigitalWeddingchat, dppreivew, and Canonforums.  I am a semi-professional and use this camera for portrait and landscape work. What I noticed first off was the quality of the photos right out of the camera. They are beautiful. With my Pentax K10D I really struggled with low light situations,, the Canon 50D camera doesn't. It is easy to learn how to use, and quite lightweight. Until I put the pro L series lens on it! The huge LCD is amazing. So crisp and clear. I find the controls well placed and easy to use. 
I do believe I paid way too much at full price, but I couldn't wait. :) I can't recommend Willoughbys enough. The camera had a dust spot in the viewfinder and I had to send it back the first day. Willoughbys sent me out a new one,, no questions asked. They also refunded me the 95.00 overnight shipping price!
They were wonderful. 
I have no regrets switching over to Canon. The 50D is a thrill to use. High quality throughout. If this camera lasts as well as the 30D has for my pro friends,, I will be in heaven. 
You won't regret a purchase of the 50D.

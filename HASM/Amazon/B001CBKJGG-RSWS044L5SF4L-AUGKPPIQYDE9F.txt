Title: A Lot of Camera for Not a Lot of Money
Content:
This camera is a FANTASTIC value...as long as you don't buy it for full retail price. I believe full retail for the kit with the EF-S 18-55mm IS lens is about $600, but I bought it on Amazon for about $460. There are deals to be had on this camera, so make sure you find them. 
CNET has a good review of this camera, so I'll just list the pros and cons as I see them.
PROS
-Phenomenal photo quality/color fidelity
-Intuitive menu/user interface
-Sensor cleaner
-Lightweight, comfortable to hold
-Fast autofocus
-Basically non-existent shutter lag
-Takes only about 1 second to turn the camera on and take a picture
-Compatible with almost all recently (last 10-15 years) manufactured Canon lenses
-10.1 MP is PLENTY
-Poster size prints are excellent (as long as pictures are crisp)
CONS
-Relatively few photos per second (3 in ideal lighting conditions)
-Multiple frames per second requires ideal lighting conditions
-Lack of spot metering makes taking pictures with lots of contrast VERY difficult (i.e. sunlight through trees or behind landscape). This is my biggest complaint with the camera.
-Not compatible with wireless remote control
-Kit lens is not great in low light conditions
-Lenses with image stabilization are very expensive
Overall, this is, in my opinion a terrific starter's digital SLR.

Title: Great heater!
Content:
This heater is wonderful and I recommend it highly.  Before we got this, we had one that just blew hot air and made the room very dry.  It used a lot more power and made noise.  This one is quiet and doesn't use as much power or dry out the room as much.  We don't need to run the humidifier when we use it, and we always did with the other one.  It also radiates light so it's a good night light but can be distracting sometimes.  I usually like it because it reminds me of the sun which I miss dreadfully during the winter months.  If you need a space heater this is definitely the kind you should buy!

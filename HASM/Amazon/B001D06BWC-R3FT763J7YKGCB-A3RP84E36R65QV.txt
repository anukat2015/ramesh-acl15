Title: Archos 5
Content:
This is the second Archos 5 I have bought. The first one had many issues. I think it was a lemon. I called Amazon who promptly sent me a replacement in one day!!! WOW!!! Amazon customer service is the BEST. All companies could learm from them. As for the new Archos 5 it has worked as advertised. I really like the much improved touch screen. I have the Archos 704 and 705 Wifi models and their touch screen was only ok. The 5 is much smaller than the 704/705 models.
Pros- 
     Small size BIG amount of storage I have the 160 GIG model
     Very good battery life.
     Very good touch screen interface
     Very easy to navigate all of the functions
     Value dollar for dollar a much better buy than Ipod Touch
     Decent software support from Archos
     Kickstand
     Does internet tv and radio! 
     Just about every type of file format is supported for video and photo
     Ability to download pictures off of my digital camera.
Cons- 
     Gets pretty warm
     Has a non standard type USB cable that only allows for a slooooow charge time. Get the battery dock for much improved charge time 3.5 hours vs 8 with std cable.
     No detachable std battery like 704/705/7 series. Not really a con more like a minor irritation to me.
Overall a good player and would recommend over Ipod Touch. Don't get me wrong the Ipod Touch is a VERY good player that works very smoothly due to its flash based memory vs Archos use of hard drives. But it must be used in conjunction with Itunes which in my opinion FORCES/LIMITS you to only one way to manage you movies and music files. Also Ipod Touch is limited to very small amount of memory when compared with Archos products.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
I got my Nikon D40x a couple of months ago. This is my first experience with an slr and dslr. Nikon made this upgrade to the world of slr so much easier with some really great preset modes. Canon wins in Feature-to-feature comparison for similar price - but after we tried both camera (Nikon and Camera), we loved the nikon's picture results much better than that from Cannon. I love it so far.
Cheers!

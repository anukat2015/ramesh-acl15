Title: Great Coffee!!! No Spills!!!!
Content:
To say that am I picky when it comes to coffee makers is an understatement.  I finally settled on this one after looking at them all!!  
Pros:
Dripless.  Unbelievable!  No matter how fast you pour it won't spill.  It makes it very easy to fill the resevior in the back with no mess (and we have limited counter space).
Cone filters - Prefer the taste over basket shaped ones.
User interface - Very intuitive!!!  If you want to change the time, just press hour.  So many others require you to hold down a combination of buttons, etc.  This is the easiest system I have ever seen.
Material - Solid!  Metal machine is very sturdy.
Cons:
No variable heat - We thought this would be a minor inconvenience, but the pad keeps the coffee perfect for us so it is not an issue.
No variable flavor - Again, we thought it might be an issue, but this makes great deep rich coffee (adjust strength by  quantity of grounds.)
Residual liquid in carafe - Yes, the design keeps about 1-2 tbsps of coffee/water after you pour everything out.  We just hold it over the sink and turn it upside down.  Very minor inconvenience.
Overall a great coffee machine!

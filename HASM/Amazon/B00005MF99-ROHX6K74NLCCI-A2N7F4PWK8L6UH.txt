Title: Good over all-loud beeps
Content:
We bought this coffee maker about two years ago. The carafe leaked when you poured,however a quick call to Black and decker customer service and they sent us a new one within a week! Then about 6 months ago the warming plate peeld. I was concerned about a fire, so my husband bought grill paint and repainted the plate. still works fine, just looks, well...painted! Also, the beeps seem to be getting louder. I've asked for another one for christmas. I just hope B&amp;D have lessened the volume!

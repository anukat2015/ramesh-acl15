Title: Great Camera, Great Price
Content:
This camera and its included software is all you need, really. It goes from "point and shoot" to all types of customized photography. If you already have Canon lenses, I strongly suggest getting the body only, and a decent memory card. Even the included flash works great. Nice job, Canon.

Title: An outstanding product!
Content:
Just returned from a trip to Belize.  There was no in-room coffee maker. luckly I had planned for just such an event with the Zelco Brisk Brew.  It worked great.  An entire coffee maker with coffee that easily fits in any travel bag.  I found that 2 of the 'M&M Mini' candy containers will hold enough coffee for several days, and easily fit in the included carrying pouch.  I can't say enough about how pleased I am with this product.

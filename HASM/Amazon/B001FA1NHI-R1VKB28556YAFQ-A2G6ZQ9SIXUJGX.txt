Title: Nano 4th generation
Content:
Everything went smooth with the shipping and delivery.  However a big problem, is that I have not been able to down load music to the thing. It wasn't shipped with hardly any instructions on how use it.  To date I have not been able to get the thing to work.  I have downloaded at least 20 songs, but the ipod tells me there are zero songs loaded and therefore will not play.  I feel I have been ripped off!

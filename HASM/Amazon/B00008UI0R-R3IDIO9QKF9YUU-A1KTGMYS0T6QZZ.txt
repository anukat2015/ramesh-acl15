Title: New vacuum overheated :(
Content:
I bought this vacuum new and it overheated within 10 minutes of using it for the first time.  It would cool off, start working, and stop within 5-10 minutes again.  I read a lot of good things about it so was extremely disappointed. In all honesty, it might not have been a great choice for our family anyway because I vacuum about every 2 days, and I have 5 kids, so the very small canister would have needed emptying constantly. The size of this vacuum would probably make it a better choice for someone with a small apartment who vacuums once a week.  One more thing is that the small brush attachment has very stiff bristles so dusting wide baseboards with it was quite difficult.  I would keep looking.  I purchased a kenmore canister from Sears instead, along with a 2 yr service warranty, and it has been great in every way.  I don't have stairs so even though it is heavy, this isn't an issue with me.

Title: Worth every penny!!
Content:
This coffee maker is so easy to operate. It makes an outstanding cup of coffee when you use the provide measuring scoop. It's fully programable and turns itself off so that you don't have bitter or burnt tasting coffee. I would recommend using paper filters in the basket due to some fine grounds left at the bottom of the pot. Buy this one. You won't be sorry you did.

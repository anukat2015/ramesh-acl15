Title: Olympus E Volt system fully featured, top value
Content:
This experienced senior photographer is in love with his EVOLT 510 camera system. I bought accessory flash and tele (50-300mm) to complete the (3 lens) set.
A rich palette of options gives the photographer professional flexibillity, all easily found on the camera's controls and menus. The autofocus is fast and accurate. The lenses are, well, spectacular. Sharp images edge to edge at all focal lengths.
Compared against the 'big name' competition which costs many hundreds more, Olympus is the bargain of the market segment. I bought my daughter the EVOLT 500 system for her 21st birthday and she is shooting fantastic shots as well.

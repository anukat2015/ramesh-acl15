Title: Excellent performance, value priced!
Content:
I purchased the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Friday night, April 11, 2008.  After a 10-minute box-to-floor period, I began to really clean my house.  I'd previously owned a Panasonic vacuum (which they said could pick up nuts, bolts, and a 15-lb. bowling ball) which had recently crapped out.  Since the Panasonic had never been good with pet hair -- always wrapped around the beater bar, stuck in the hose, etc., I decided to research a new brand.  I noted that though the Bissell PHE had received drastically mixed reviews, I decided that the positive input I read, coupled with the relatively inexpensive price, I threw caution to the wind and made the purchase.
WOW!  I honestly couldn't believe my eyes after seeing all the crud that this baby picked up!  It is a bit on the heavy side, but maneuvers quite easily for it's bulk, I think.  The collection "cup" is easy to remove, empty and replace.  I was on a cleaning high all weekend, I even vacuumed out my heating vents.  After all this, no hair was wound around the beater bar, everything had been cyclonically sucked up into the collection chamber.  I do not think it makes any more noise than any other vacuum I have used, but it certainly does a better job.  My recommendation?  BUY IT!!!

Title: Better Than Expected
Content:
I own two Canon point and shoot cameras which take great pictures. However, this camera is in a whole other league. It is also quite an improvement from film DSL's of the 80's. I also bought the EF-S 55 250  mm zoom lens with the $[...] instant rebate. I find myself using that lens more than the kit lens. Both take great pictures. I'm amazed how much I can crop and keep the picture sharp up to ISO 1600. I bought this camera so that I could take rapid pictures of my 3 grandkids. The burst rate with the built in flash is good and it is really fast without the flash. I'm amazed how many pictures I'm taking. I use a Class 4 PNY 8GB HC memory card. It can handle large fine JPEG Burst shots with no problems. I'm not sure how it would handle video or RAW plus JPEG. My friend has a $1500 EF lens which is clearly sharper than the lenses I purchased. That will be by next upgrade. Buy it, you wont be disapointed.

Title: Neat, yes! Have I saved any money? Nope...
Content:
I was itching to replace the large and bulky thermostat in my apartment with a slimmer unit. This one fit the bill nicely. The instructions were clear on install,, but the programming is difficult with this model. It's very slim though and I like that about it. the indiglo is nice too for lighting. Unfortunately I have not seen a savings on my energy bills. In fact my bill rose $10 since installing it. I don't think that was the cause though, as there are far too many factors to consider.
Overall though it works as advertised. The instructions aren't great but for $25 I am not complaining.

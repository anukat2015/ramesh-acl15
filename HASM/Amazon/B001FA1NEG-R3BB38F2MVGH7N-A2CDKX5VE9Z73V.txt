Title: 16GB Nano
Content:
Product is easy to operate and software from iTunes is easy to download and use.  I was a bit suprised to find that 2GB of the available 16 was occupied with "other" data which I can only assume to be the operating system.  Having had a much larger capacity player previously, it was a surprise to relinquish one-eighth of the capacity.

Title: Graduated to SLR
Content:
Have been a fan of Olympus cameras since the film days with my 30 years old clamshell 35mm still operable.  Have been using C-750 and C-8080 (great optics, steep leaning curve).  The E500 optics are almost as good as the 8080,however, much more user friendly.  Controls are handy and intuitive. Outstanding feature.  NO MORE SHUTTER LAG! Overall quality first class.  Only minus is the small viewfinder, hard to see settings off to the side wearing glasses.

Title: Allergy sufferers and pet owners DO NOT BUY!
Content:
I had a dirt devil about 10 years ago that worked awesome.  Then I bought a bissell for $89.  That lasted a year.  Then I bought the reaction by dirt devil.  After about 3 uses it loses suction.  Like one of the previous customers I wanted a Dyson, couldn't afford one so, this seemed like a nice consolation prize.  Please do NOT waste your money.  If you have pets, it just does not suck up the hair.  I have hair everywhere.  If you have allergies as I do, please save your money.  Everytime I vaccuum I go into a sneezing frenzy.  I can't even dump the damn dust bin because if I do I can't breathe.  So, I finally broke down and saved enough for a Dyson.  It should be here within 2 weeks.  I can't wait!

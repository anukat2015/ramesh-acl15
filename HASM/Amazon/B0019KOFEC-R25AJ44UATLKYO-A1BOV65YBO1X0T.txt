Title: this little things sucks....sorta
Content:
with 2 new pups in the house our hard wood floors were starting to look like carpets...enter the mighty mite pet lover.  works great on hard wood, furniture and on berber carpet.  i think its not so great on our area rug but my husband disagrees.  its super lightweight and although i bought it to drag aroung i find myself holding the canister cause its so light. make sure you keep the hole in the back of the hose covered for maximum suction and that the attachment is fully on or it'll come off if you're trying to get in under things. would have loved an automatic cord but hey it was less than $100.  they just don't make things like they used to.  so far so good though its been a couple weeks....we'll see

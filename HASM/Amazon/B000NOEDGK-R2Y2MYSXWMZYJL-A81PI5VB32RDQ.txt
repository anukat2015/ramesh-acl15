Title: Must have for new parents.
Content:
I bought it to take pictures of our new baby and it does not disappoint.    I am so glad I did.  Great photos indoor or outdoors.  If you are a new parent, you MUST buy a DSLR.  Do NOT stick with a point-and-shoot.  You need that as well for portability, but most of the photos you take will be at home, and even an average DSLR blows any point-and-shoot out of the water in picture quality.  And this is one of the best entry level DSLRs.  
You can improve picture quality significantly with an external flash, or so I have heard.  Have not splurged for one myself yet.  The built-in flash seems adequate.  But it is on my wish list.
The focus is not quite as sharp as some high end cameras and ones that the pros use, but is still amazing.  Colors are very well captured.  I wish Nikon included CaptureNX with the Camera rather than selling it separately.  Also Raw+Jpeg mode is weak since Jpegs in that mode are just adequate to attach to emails.  Not very good at all.  The new D60 seems like a good replacement for this camera, although not a whole lot different.
Overall I am very pleased with the Camera and would definitely recommend buying.

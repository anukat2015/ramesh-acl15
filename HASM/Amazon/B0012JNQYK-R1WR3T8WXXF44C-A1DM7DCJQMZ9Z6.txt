Title: Good MP3 player that falls a little short
Content:
First, let me say that this is a very nice MP3 player. There are many things that Apple did that well, but there are also minor issues that really hold this product from achieving it's full potential. I actually prefer my PSP and my IPOD classic (which I will be going back to).
PROS:
**Sexy sleek body. Very eye catching design and appealing to look at. Front panel very durable, no scratching.
**Nice applications. Checking personal email, having Maps & Notes feature, using Safari, Youtube shortcut and access to stock report are all pretty cool options.
**Coverflow is awesome and in my opinion the best new feature of the IPOD.
Glad they expanded it to 32 GB. (However when sync'd to itunes, it says that the capacity is actually 29.6 GB)
CONS:
Music Layout design is not as intuitive as the previous IPOD classic. Without the wheel, you need look at the appropriate screen and then select the choices by hitting icons, buttons or rows. For the old version IPOD classic, I never even had to take it out of my pocket because you can control all the options on the wheel. It was easier to switch between menus and selecting music that way, rather than having to stare at the screen and look for what I wanted to play. I think IPOD touch feels clumsy.
**Touch screen not sensitive enough. You literally need to hit the button (or key) dead on in order to respond accurately. Very fustrating.

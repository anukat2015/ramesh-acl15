Title: Great IPOD!!
Content:
This is a really nice ipod. I like how small it is, but can still hold so much stuff. I can't think of anything bad to say about it except the battery life is kinda short and my older dock doesn't charge this ipod. But i guess you can always buy a wall charger for it. Thats the only reason i didn't give this ipod 5 stars. 
I definitely recommend this ipod to anyone.

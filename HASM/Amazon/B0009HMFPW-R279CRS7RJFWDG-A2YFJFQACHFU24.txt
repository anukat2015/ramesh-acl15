Title: Had to get it!
Content:
After discovering that the method of attaching the Cozy Heater to my wall was with sticky little doodads I decided I needed the metal stand instead. I don't feel like scraping off doodads and repainting my wall every year when I put the heater away for the summer. They make a point of not mentioning the doodad method but the stand works fine. They should include the stand with the heater but then they wouldn't be able to suck another sale and shipping charge out of you if they did. Get the stand right away! That way you won't have the heater propped against your wall for a couple weeks waiting for the stand to arrive.

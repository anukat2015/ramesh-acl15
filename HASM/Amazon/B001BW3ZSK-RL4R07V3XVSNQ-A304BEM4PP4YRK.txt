Title: Nice..but not perfect
Content:
Hi,
I got this a couple of weeks ago.  It is not bad--looks good, sounds good (on Shure 210s, anyway).
Unlike some reviews the d-click seems fine to me.
My issues are:
a) it doesn't order songs well.  There is no (easy) way to order things by Artist and then Album for example.  Ever worse, Albums are not in alphabetical order.  This is a real pain!
b) it doesn't play nicely with linux...you can get it to work, but out of the box it needs a little tweaking

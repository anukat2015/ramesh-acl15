Title: Great for the Price
Content:
I bought this one as a replacement for my other Black and Decker 12 cup since I left it on all day long and could not find another carfe for it. I have had it for three weeks and it is perfect.  Its great to wake up to the smell of freshly brewing coffee, and the easy pour feature that the Carfe has eleminates spilling coffee on the counter at 6 am. I have not experienced any problems like other revewiers. However I did notice that on the carfe there are two levels indicated, one for coffee and one for water. So if you want 12 cups of coffee you have to fill it to the line slightly above the 12 cup mark and the carfe is difficult to clean since it is contured to be easy to pour. It is a bit loud too. The warming plate keeps the coffee very hot; and in my experience with it I usually end up turning it off before I finish all of the coffee since it gets too hot. I brew several pots of coffee every day (to fill up travel cups; and when I have guests). Other than that with a bit of common sense and you do not expect the quality of a Mercedez Benz for the price of a Toyota; you should have years of faithfull service ahead of you with this coffee machine.

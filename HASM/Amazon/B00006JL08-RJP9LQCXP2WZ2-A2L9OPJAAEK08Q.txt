Title: Excellent
Content:
As a similar reviewer had experienced - I broke the carafe on my old Braun coffee maker. $25 for a new carafe vs $45 for a whole new coffee maker. I decided it was time for the new coffee maker. 
Has not disappointed. Excellent coffee. Brews very fast. Love the swing out basket design. Love the included water filter. Love the included gold reusable coffee filter (very green / good for the environment).
I've always liked Braun's coffee makers and this unit is an excellent bargain. Got it through J&R via Amazon. Fast shipping & excellent prices.
High praise for the product & the merchant.

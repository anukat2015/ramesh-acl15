Title: Cuisinart Coffeemaker
Content:
This is my first non-Braun coffeemaker.  Had it for about two weeks now and very pleased.  I like the flip top lid, easy to remove the filter and coffee basket.  The water bin is a bit awkward to reach, have to be a bit careful in spilling water.  There is a number of cups water guide in the water bin, but unless you are looking directly down at it it's very hard to see.  It makes good tasing coffee.  Warming plate has three adjustable settings which is also nice.  Cleanup is very easy with the Cuisinart.

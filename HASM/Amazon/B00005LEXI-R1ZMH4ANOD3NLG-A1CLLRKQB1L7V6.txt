Title: Reliable and easy to operate
Content:
We just completed our first camping trip using this heater and were very pleased with its performance. The outdoor temperature was in the low 40's, the wind was blowing at 15 with gusts to 20, and it was frequently raining. We brought a fully charged 20lb propane tank and a 10 foot extension hose so we could keep the tank outside the tent. We used the heater for about 10 hours on each of three nights (30 hours total). On two nights it was on high the whole time and on the third night we cut it down to low after about 4 hours because it was getting too warm in the tent. Even on the coldest nights I was comfortable in my shirt sleeves, but my wife was still a little chilled - her natural state. The heater was very stable and is easy to operate. 
We also used the same propane tank for all of our cooking - breakfast for 4 people for 3 days, lots of hot water for coffee and dish washing for 3 days, and dinner for 4 people on 2 nights. And we've still got some gas left.
From another perspective, if not for the heater we would have had to get a motel room - the heater paid for itself in one night.

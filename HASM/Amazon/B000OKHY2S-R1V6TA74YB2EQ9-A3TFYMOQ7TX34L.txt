Title: Portable and easy
Content:
My wife and I were looking for a portable unit that would cool us off a bit in the afternoon and especially while we slept; one that was cost effective and affordable.  We've been using the SPT SF-608R for about two months now and it's been good.  Doesn't get as cold as we'd hoped, but it is not an air conditioner; it uses evaporation to lower the temperature - the addition of ice quite increases its effectiveness.
  It is easy to move around, it is very easy to use and it definitely takes the edge off.  We're satisfied with the purchase and happy to have it around.
  In fact, it's getting hot in here so I'm going to go turn it on right now...

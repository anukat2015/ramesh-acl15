Title: Fits my needs
Content:
This is a great heater.  I like that it creates its own airflow without a fan - the hot air just comes off the top as if there were a fan!  I also love the timer function - you can set the heater to be on or off in 15 minute segments all day long.  I use this feature to have it warm up my bedroom so it's warm when I arrive home from work, just before bedtime, and also to warm up the room before I wake up, without having the heater run all night (it's a powerful little thing!).  The air doesn't get dried out,  but it circulates and becomes toasty warm.  There is also three output settings (1,2, and 3), so you can really crank it up if you need some heat quickly, but keep it low for everyday use.  I'm extremely pleased with this heater.

Title: FANTASTIC!!
Content:
My daughter and I sleep in the basement (a living room, bedroom, bathroom setup) of my mother's house while I go to school.  In the winter we freeze down there - and with the cost of electricity my mother is just not willing to turn up the thermostat.  We were looking for an affordable alternative that wouldn't cost her loads on her electric bill.  Enter the DeLonghi heater.  This thing has been FABULOUS.  If you want to get almost uncomfortably warm - close the door... you'll roast.  With the door cracked and this puppy on high - we are very toasty in our chilly basement.  Sometimes I move it out to the living room during the day.  Since that room is open to the stairs it doesn't do as well there - but it definitely warms the room.  I have had NO smells or problems or yellowing.  I bought a refurbished unit that had a quarter sized paint chip - but who cares!  This winter is the second winter in a row that we've had it. No problems!

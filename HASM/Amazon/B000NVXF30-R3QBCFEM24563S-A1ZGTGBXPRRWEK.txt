Title: Totally pleased
Content:
This camera was purchased as a Christmas present.  I was pleased with the quality of the product, it has good weight and good feel to it.  The battery life is very good and the expandability of this product makes it great.  I purchased it with a 800mm lens kit and everything worked out great.
Shipping time was good.  Just a note, this does not include a memory card, so make sure you purchase one along with this camera.

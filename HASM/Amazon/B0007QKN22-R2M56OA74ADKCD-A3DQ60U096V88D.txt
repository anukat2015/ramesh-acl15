Title: Different results than the Rebel SLR film camera
Content:
I've had a the Canon Rebel for film which unfortunately is in not working, but in the auto focus mode, it seemed easier to get a great shot than in this one.  I've had a whole birthday party turn out blurry with this camera.  It's likely that I just didn't find the right setting, but it's not like I just opened the box either.  It was a bowling alley, lower light with action so that made a difference.  Also, I have had situations where I would like a shot with no flash, but I can't avoid blur.  I switched to manual and seemed to get what I wanted, but the auto focus almost always forces a flash in most any lighting situation!  ERRRR!  I am going to switch to the lens with my old camera and hope this helps.  This is still the best deal you will find if you are desperate for a digital SLR like I was.  Best of luck!

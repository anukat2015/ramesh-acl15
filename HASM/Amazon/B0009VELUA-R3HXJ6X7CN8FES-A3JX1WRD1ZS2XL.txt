Title: I liked it at first but.......
Content:
We have had this coffee maker for about 6 months, it started slowly driping a lttle after about 4 months and we had to put a cup under the dispenser so it wouldnt make a mess before we got to it, we put up with that, now it leaks almost the full pot we have brewed. This has proven to be a disaster, coffee all over the countertop.  I would recomend you do not purchase this coffee maker.

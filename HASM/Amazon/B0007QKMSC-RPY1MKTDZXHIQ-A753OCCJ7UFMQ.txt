Title: Top Notch digital
Content:
I bought this camera as soon as it was available on Amazon, and have had it for about a month now.  The experience has been fantastic.  The pictures are nothing less than stunning.  Colors are great, resolution is amazing, and the software package is very complete and easy to use.
Probably the best features are the number of modes that are available, and the ease of use.  It can be set to a full program mode, and used as a point and click snapshot camera by anyone at all, or put into full manual mode for the more experienced.  
I do have a couple of suggestions.  Order this body without the Canon lens.  I upgraded to a Sigma 28-300 mm Macro Zoom for about the cost of the original lens, and now have one lens for virtually any situation.
Also, get top notch compact flash card.  I bought high speed, 1 GB Lexar 80x flash because I really wanted the ability to take high speed repetative pictures.  I was not disappointed.  You can either take one picture after another about as fast as you can hit the sutter, or put the camera into repeat-shot mode and hold the shutter button down.  This is a great feature.
Also order a spare battery or two.  It takes a lot of pictures on a single charge, but seems to go from a full battery indication down to dead real fast, so there's not a lot of warning that you need to charge up.
All in all, a very outstanding bit of technology.

Title: Tried and True
Content:
I went through several brands and types of coffemakers over the years.  One after another they all ended up in the trash or sitting on a thrift shop shelf.  I was tired of the hassle of breakable decanters, coffee spills all over the counter and that burny taste, ruining my morning coffee time.  I finally decided to try the Cuisinart DCC-2000, half-heartedly willing to cough up the cash.  But I'm here to tell you that this baby is worth every penny.  It is a smart machine.  That is, smart as in easy, and smart as in well designed.  No more coffee mess, and cup after cup the coffee tastes smooth and fresh.  It's simple to maintain.  The coffee reservoir comes right out.  Just rinse it, let it dry and replace.  If you like to store your excess coffee for iced coffee later on, this may not be the machine for you.  Only a large sized coffee mug fits under the coffee dispersal feature.  I love the coffee gauge on the front, letting me know how much is left.  There is also a feature for extra hot coffee (1-4 cups feature), but even if you decide to not use it, the coffee will stay hot and fresh for hours.  I also like the box-like design.  It fits nicely on kitchen countertops and under cabinets.  I used this coffeemaker for about a month before wtiting this review.  I wanted to be sure it was worth the positive feedback.  It's a bit pricey, but hold out for Amazon rewards coupons if you want to save a little cash.

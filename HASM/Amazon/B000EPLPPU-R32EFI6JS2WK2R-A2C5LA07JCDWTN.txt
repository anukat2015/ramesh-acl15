Title: Flawless in Design and Perfect for Workouts
Content:
Yes. This is what I have been waiting for. The ipod shuffle is the perfect workout companion. The size of the shuffle is it's main selling point and it is small. It has a strong clip on the backside that you can attach to your pants, shirt or whatever else you want to and not have to worry about it holding. The functionality is basic (and this is a plus) just an on/off switch and a shuffle/straight play switch on top. On it's face are only the play/pause button, volume up and down buttons and forward and back buttons. The sound quality of the shuffle is excellent. Accessory-wise, the shuffle comes with earphones and a dock for charging and downloading music. The only drawback with this model is that you have to keep the shuffle connected to a USB port to charge, there is no separate charger. The setup is so simple that it took me literally 5 minutes to have my shuffle setup, registered and loaded with tunes. The shuffle holds roughly 240 songs which is more than ample for workouts and most people's daily lives. Anyway, if you want an inexpensive quality product and workout companion then the ipod shuffle is the gadget for you. Highly Recommended.

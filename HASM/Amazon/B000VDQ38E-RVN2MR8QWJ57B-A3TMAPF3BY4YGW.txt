Title: Heavy but worth it!
Content:
I bought this vacuum right after seeing the commercial.  I have 2 dogs and one of them sheds so much is drives me insane. I vacuumed every day with my other vacuum and it didn't make a difference.  When this arrived I had it out and put together in minutes and was vacuuming.  It was a breeze to push but a load to pull back!  BUT it picked up so much pet hair I couldn't beleive it!  The cannister is a pain to empty, and quite a mess to do.  Although the tools work great, they are also not easy to use because the main unit is so big and heavy....BUT still...for what it picks up...I'll deal with it.  That is the reason I got it, and it does what it claims to do...erases pet hair from your rugs...for an hour or two anyway...:)

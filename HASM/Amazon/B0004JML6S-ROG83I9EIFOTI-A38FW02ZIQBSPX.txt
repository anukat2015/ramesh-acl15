Title: Good coffee
Content:
This is my second Krups coffeemaker, and it seems to be working better than the previous one.
On the positive side:
- Make great coffee
- Looks very good
- Unlike the previous model, when you program the timer, it will only make coffee once. In the previous version, you had to switch off the timer, otherwise the alarm would go off, because of no water (which happened to me on many Sunday mornings when I was sleeping in)
- My water quality is very bad, and I am used to buy coffee makers every year. Generally they start slowing down because the maker gets clogged after a couple of months. I am using this one with the filters and it is still going strong after 7 months. 
On the negative side
- The carafe drips, so you need to pour _very_ slowly
- The timer unit is not exactly water proof, so when you spill water over the timer, the coffeemaker starts brewing.
- There seems to be a software bug. When you turn off the sounds, it still gives a high-pitched sound when the warmer plate of the coffee maker shuts down (after 1-3h, which is configurable). Quite annoying when it wakes up the baby.

Title: Design flaw
Content:
This is a beautiful coffee pot and the brew was terrific.  No complaints there.  My problem was with the design and layout of the clock.  When the coffee was brewing, excessive steam would rise and completely disable the clock.  The steam would get inside the mechanism which could only shorten the life of the timer I so desperately needed.  It would take an hour to regain visibility and after a week, I returned it as defective.  The second pot did exactly the same thing and I decided there must be better out there.  I can't recommend this great looking coffee pot, even though it made a really good cup of coffee.

Title: I really like this camera
Content:
I tried the Rebel XTi and the Sony A100.  The Nikon felt the best in my hand, I thought the viewfinder was significantly superior to the other and the camera was very quick (and quiet) to autofocus.  I think the Rebel would have been a good choice as well, but I am very pleased with the Nikon.

Title: Only one version of this coffee maker
Content:
I called Zojirushi as well, and they confirmed that there is only one version of this coffee maker. There is no difference between the EC-BD15 and the EC-BD15BA. The "BA" signifies "black," as in the color of this machine. Strangely enough, the "BA" makes the price increase.
You can call Zojirushi direct (800-733-6270) and confirm this yourselves. Again, there is only one version, so be wary of paying more for the "BA."
As for the machine, it's great. The carafe retains heat well, thus negating the need for a warming element. This is better as your coffee won't cook and taste funny over time.

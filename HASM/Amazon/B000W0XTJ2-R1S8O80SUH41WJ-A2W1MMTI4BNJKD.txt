Title: Don't waste you money
Content:
I purchased this computer 1 year and 5 months ago.  WIFI failed a week ago.  Checking the web, this is a known issue that is the fault of the motherboard.  HP wants over $400 to repair even though it is a known issue.
This issue includes any of the tx1000 models.

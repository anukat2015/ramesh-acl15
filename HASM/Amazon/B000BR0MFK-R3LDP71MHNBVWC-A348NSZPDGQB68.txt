Title: First iPod
Content:
This is my first iPod. (I'm a "mature" woman...) I chose the Nano because of the cost and simplicity of design and function. I was amazed how small it is and how nicely it fits in my hand. I own a small plant nursery and often have dirty, wet hands, so I definitely needed a cover.
Now I have a cover that clips onto a belt, and am able to listen to the radio programming I cannot receive here in our rural area. 
In other words, it's perfect and just what I wanted.

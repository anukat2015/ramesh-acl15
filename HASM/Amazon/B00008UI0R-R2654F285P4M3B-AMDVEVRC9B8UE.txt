Title: don't use after warranty
Content:
This vacuum was fantastic for the first year. Now its been over a year and we are having electrical problems that cannot be replaced but have to be serviced. For a product that cost so much to buy - why can we not purchase the "molded" electrical parts? I called hoover and they gave me no other alternative. Watch out folks.. you might be paying an arm and a leg.

Title: great addition/upgrade to my iPod collection
Content:
I got into the iPod scene rather late in the game. My first iPod was a first generation iPod that I bought used a little less than two years ago. It was a little too bulk for my main uses which are mainly working out and walking. I upgraded to a new 4GB iPod Nano and loved it. I was starting to run out of space on my Nano, so I was fortunate to receive the 30 GB iPod as a gift. I'm already a fan of iTunes and the various features of the iPod family, bu the new feature that I like most about this iPod is its video capability. Even though friends had told me that watching video on the iPod was not bad, I had my doubts. However, after taking my new iPod on a transatlantic flight and watching a couple of episodes of Law & Order, I have to say that I was very satisfied with the quality of the picture. It sure helped to pass the time. For some reason I did not get the 3.5 hours of video playback that Apple claims. In fact my battery was almsot drained in a little under 2 hours...perhaps my iPod was not fully charged. In any case, it seems that there are a lot of small external power/battery options that will get my iPod across the Atlantic next time. I should note that this iPod is perhaps a little too bulky for my workouts...fortunately I still have my Nano for the gym.

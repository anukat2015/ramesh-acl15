Title: DeLonghi SafeHeat Heater
Content:
Heater is pretty good all around.  It gives off a good amount of heat (available on 2 settings: 1 or 2) as well as an adustible fan setting (1-6).  Since I use this heater only at my office, I wanted a heater with a thermostat to adjust.  This heater does just that and turns off when it's reached the desired temperature.  My only qualm is that the heater does not turn off when it is knocked over as other heaters have the capability to do.  This is simply a safety feature, but would be nice to have in the event the heater fell onto its side while hot.  However, I am usually pretty good about turning the heater off at night, so this is not a problem for me.

Title: Awesome vacuum!
Content:
I've been using 2 different vacuums in my house; one for the tile and one for the carpet.  I researched so many vacuums and this one seemed to be perfect.  WOW.  A vacuum that really vacuums!  It's lightweight so I'm not having to haul around the upright, and moving from carpet to tile is SO MUCH EASIER than getting out a special vacuum for the tile floor! It vacuums carpet extremely well, and with a quick switch of the tools I have the tile attachment and I'm off and vacuuming.  The only downside is that if you want to buy the hepa bags they're CRAZY expensive.  But it's nice to vacuum my house and not have dust sitting all over the furniture when I'm done.  It's also incredibly quiet, and the cord length is perfect so I don't have to unplug and replug it every 10 steps.  The cord keeper is VERY easy and winds it right back up so you're not having to wind it around plastic holders that break.  This vacuum is the best I've owned.

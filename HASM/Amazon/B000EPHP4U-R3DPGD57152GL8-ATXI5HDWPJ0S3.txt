Title: Not a bad nano
Content:
I have had my nano for about 4 months now. I too have had the screen freeze problem. However this only happens when the battery is just about to die and the easy fix to this is to press Menu & select for 10 seconds. The system reboots and you are back in action. The major problem I do have is the scratching. I just wish I had bought a case on day one. My advice is, buy the 4g and buy a case.

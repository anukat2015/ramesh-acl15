Title: AWESOME!
Content:
This is my notebook to die for!  Everything I've been looking for and never found before, finally.  Super lightweight, battery lasts forever (8-plus hours on max performance, more on battery-sparing settings -- but who needs to do that, with this longevity?), the touchpad is amazing (only need one hand to do everything; I don't get the bad reviews on it at all!), beautiful to look at (also don't get the bad reviews re fingerprints...not a problem), stays super COOL no matter what I'm doing!  I've had it just about 3 weeks and just keep lovin' it more and more, including Win 7.  I could go on and on.  Little things like the way the keys fit so snugly that no gunk will ever invade the KB, the feel of the keys, fast boot, fast everything, fab display - all for an AWESOME PRICE, too. This little sweetie delivers!  I am so pleased.

Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser 3920
Content:
Ok, read some of the others.  Some bad comments seem to be from people who don't read the instructions (as usual).  Yes, it is a heavy vacuum, Yes it is somewhat loud, but nowhere near the db rating of a small Dirt Devil I have for our RV Trailer.  Does it work well, well all I can say is vacuum your carpets and whatever with your old vacuum, then fire up the 3920.  Do this in a private setting as you might be embarrassed as to what this vacuum picks up.  We have two cats, both long haired but one is far worse than the other as far as shedding is concerned, he leaves tufts of hair all over.  Yes, the cup is small, but that may not be a bad thing, since you probably ought to dump it every time you vacuum anyway.  So if you want a light vacuum, that is ultra quiet, picks up everything but Grandma and costs a $1.50 - lots of luck.

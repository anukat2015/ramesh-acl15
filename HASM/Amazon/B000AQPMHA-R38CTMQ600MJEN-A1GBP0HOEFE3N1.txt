Title: I'm ordering another machine for the office
Content:
I bought the Keurig B40 Elite several weeks ago, and can't say enough good about it. I bought it for home, where I rarely drink more than a cup, or two in the morning before work. Since getting the brewer, I've really started enjoying my coffee more and have even begun drinking tea. The flavors of both coffees and teas available are incredible. I wish the actual K-Cups were a little cheaper, but guess I am willing to pay a little more for the increased quality. Now, I'm buying a second brewer for the office.

Title: Sweet MP3 player
Content:
This is a nice mp3 player.  Great sound, portability, playlists, audiobooks, and podcasts the Sansa Clip+ has it all.  Well all except a large screen. So, this is obviously not the player for you if you want to watch videos. And the small screen can be a challenge to read if your eyesight is not the best.  This mp3 player is the one you want to take to the gym, or when you go walking or jogging.  Select your favorite music, clip it to your clothing and go.  The Sansa Clip+ comes with some earbuds of modest quality.  So, you may want to purchase better quality earbuds if sound quality is important to you. The Clip+ is also expandable. You can buy MicroSD/MicroSDHC cards to increase the player's storage capacity.  What are you waiting for, grab your wallet and go buy a Sansa Clip+.

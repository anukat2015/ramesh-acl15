Title: Wicked laptop even with the design
Content:
This is a great laptop. It moves nicely and is quite powerful, given the price it is absoultely beyond compare with the rest of the market. It has more than enough power to get the job done and with the 1gig of dedicated or descreet memory on the video card it plays just about any game out there. 
It has been an awesome machine for me, I don't notice that it is all that hot. 
The only con: the bezel around the edges are quite fragile!

Title: Excellent with minor quirks
Content:
I purchased my NU Dolphin about a year ago and it's still going strong.  I mostly do lap swimming and spend 4-5 hours a week in the pool, all with my Dolphin.  Good sound quality, good function and very easy to use.
A couple of items that are less favorable.  The ear buds work well if you put them in dry.  Once they get water on the inside, the sounds goes downhill fast.  I strap the unit to my goggles and the length of the earphone cord makes it rather annoying. Shorter would be better for my situation.  The other issue I have with it, is the earphones are not a standard earphone jack, so it takes special earphones to operate.
In all, it's been a fantastic swim partner.

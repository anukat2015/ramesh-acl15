Title: Awesome camera, right price....happy camper.
Content:
I bought this camera and love it.  This camera takes great pictures and the fact that it works with the EOS accessories is a huge plus.  I can use the other lens that I have without having to buy new gear.
Its not too heavy and fits well in the hands.  I also purchased a 4GB card and have extra storage space.
I am very happy with the camera and highly recommend it.

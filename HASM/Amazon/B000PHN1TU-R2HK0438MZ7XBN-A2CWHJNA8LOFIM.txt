Title: great Bang for the Buck!
Content:
This is my first MP3 Player,I have had it for a day and I am thoroughly impressed! For one it is a mere 36.50 off of Amazon,I was a bit leery of the price but it turned out to be more than just ok. Sound is crisp and clear,Plug and play technology makes it easy to load,the earbuds take a bit of getting used too,but not uncomfortable. All and All a great product,who needs to spend over 80 on a ipod shuffle when you can have the Zen stone for less than half!

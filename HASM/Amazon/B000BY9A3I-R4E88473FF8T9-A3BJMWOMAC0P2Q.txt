Title: Just Right!
Content:
This seems just right for a small condo or home with mix of carpet and flooring. More efficient on the flooring than carpet, but still powerful with good pick up. As everyone has said, accessories fall off the wand storage, so just keep them in the closet till needed. The HEPA filter does get clogged, but can be cleaned as needed. A small hand vac is good for this job. Don't replace  the filter when dirty. That would get expensive. Has good warranty for low cost unit. Nice hot rod red color.

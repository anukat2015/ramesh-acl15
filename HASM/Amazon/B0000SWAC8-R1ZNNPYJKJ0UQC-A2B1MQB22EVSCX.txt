Title: Slick vacuum but weak link in design
Content:
We loved this vacuum from the day it arrived until the day it broke.  The cleaning head is held onto the arm by a tiny plastic C-clamp which locks into place with even tinier plastic pins.  A few months of very gentle use and those pins came off.  Electrolux has now agreed to send us a replacement clamp, but the service person on the phone made clear she would send just one and that this was a "courtesy".  What about 4 months from now when the new one breaks?  This is clearly a design flaw, and the manufacturer should include 5 or 10 of these things for the vacuum to still work a few years after purchase.

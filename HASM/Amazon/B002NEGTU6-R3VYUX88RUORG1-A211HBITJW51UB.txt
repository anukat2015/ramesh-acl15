Title: New AF System Not Working -  Replaced with New Body
Content:
Ordered from Amazon. Lens used is Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L.
 
Compared to my Canon 40D, the 7D has the new 19-point AF System, but it does NOT work. 
Most all my pictures are not as sharp as my 40D unless I manually focus regardless of AF mode or micro-adjustment. 
The images are out of focus and it is not consistent behavior one could associate with typical back/front focus issue.
Most reviews heaped praises on the new AF system, perhaps I got an early production (defective) unit. 
Not worth upgrading from a 40D if the pictures are not sharp. I may try exchanging or wait for Canon to work out the issues.
I did update the firmware. Video quality seems on par with other Canon HD Video.
Overall, I'm disappointed in the 7D since expectations were very high.
10-30-09 -- Sent back to Amazon. Waiting on new body.
12-21-09 -- Replacement body was received a month ago and is working perfectly in every mode.

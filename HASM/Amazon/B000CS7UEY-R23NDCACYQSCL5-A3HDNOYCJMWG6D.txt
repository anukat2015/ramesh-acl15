Title: Excellent Player!! As good as the iPod... or even better!
Content:
Great player!! Here is a resume of the pros and cons:
PROS:
-Great battery life
-Has Radio, radio and voice recording capability
-Can use pictures as wallpaper
-Great Screen
-Great support of video files
-Excellent sound quality
-Software is very easy to use and very stable
-Nice headphones... very similar to the ipods headphones
CONS:

-Playlist not as easy to create as it is on the ipod
-Thicker than the ipod
-Horizontal touchpad can be a pain... although once you get used to it is very easy to use.

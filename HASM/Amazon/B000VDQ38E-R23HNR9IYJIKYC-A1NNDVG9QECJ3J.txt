Title: Thoroughly Disgusted...
Content:
yet amazed by the amount of gunk that the cleaner was able to suck up. Four times the amount of my previous vacuum, my floor actually looked decent for a change. I gave it a 4 star rating instead of five because putting the machine together, cleaning the brushes and putting the belt back on was not fun; in fact, putting the belt back on was almost painful. While the vacuum is heavier than almost all the other machines I've had before, it's almost fun to use. I say almost because I hate to vacuum!

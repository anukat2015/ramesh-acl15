Title: Love it!
Content:
I've only had this product for a short while, but so far I'm in love.  I couldn't find a personal coffeemaker anywhere in my local area.  So, this was a great deal and it works wonderfully.  I don't drink coffee, so maybe this isn't this most recommended review, but my hot tea is fabulous.  The maker handles standard sized coffee mugs, none of the tall ones, but I'm sure everyone has mugs (besides the one it comes with) that will be accomodated by this maker.  I especially appreciate the auto shut-off feature.  I would definitely recommend this product to those that need a hot drink fix for one (I keep mine on my desk at work).

Title: The best little coffee maker I've ever owned
Content:
This coffee maker does everything I need, it makes excellent coffee and keeps it nice and hot.  Can't ask for more than that.
That was then.  I had to repleace the original after 6 months as it quit making hot water.  The replacement failed as well so I now have a Keurig.

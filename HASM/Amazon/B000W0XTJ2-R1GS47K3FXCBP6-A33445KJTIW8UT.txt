Title: NEVER buy this laptop
Content:
This computer starts to fail right after the warranty expiration. Don't ever buy it. HP has a terrible customer service, no matter if the problem is their responsibilitity, they will try to charge you in some way. My computer died after 1 year and half. Guess what? I got no help from HP. This device has several problem, specially in its design, making it get too hot and, after some time of use, your windows won't restart (believe me, it's not a virus -> if you want, reinstall everything.. it last one more week at most). The first sign of problem starts with the wireless card = it won't work anymore. Then you will start to see a black screen right before loading the BIOS. 
If you are planning to buy it: DON'T do it. If you already bought, sorry. If possible, buy an extra warranty then until you can.

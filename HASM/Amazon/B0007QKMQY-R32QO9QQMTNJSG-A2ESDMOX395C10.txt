Title: Pleasantly Pleased
Content:
I have had my Rebel XT for 1.5 years now.  I'm very pleased with it, except for the small LCD screen, but I'll trade a big screen for camera quality anyday!  I do sometimes have issues with the auto focus and find that I can usually flip to manual, take a picture, and flip back to auto and the camera will continue working fine.  I've had to do this less than ten times in a year and a half-and I'm a mom! (Meaning I take LOTS and LOTS of pictures)  Unlike someone who previously wrote of having focus issues, I often get crystal clear photos when the I do decide to set the camera in auto mode.  I've even had professionals comment on the photo clarity and inquire what camera I use.  Would I buy it again....no...I'd buy a newer version(which wasn't available when I bought mine).  That's how much I like the XT.

Title: Even Better than my Old ME Super
Content:
I bought a used one from Amazon Warehouse. I expected it to have some blemishes.  There were none.  It is like new and although I have only taken a few indoor shots,  I am very impressed.  I uploaded some of the pictures to my pc and you can zoom in on our cat so close you can almost count the hair in his ear.  Although I am not a camera expert,  I do know about resolution as I work with Photoshop and InDesign on a daily basis putting together a Motorcycle magazine. Folks this thing is great and I have not even taken any raw files yet.

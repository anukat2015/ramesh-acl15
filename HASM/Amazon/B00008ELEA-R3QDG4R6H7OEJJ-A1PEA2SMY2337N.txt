Title: Excellent coffee pot
Content:
First and foremost, this coffee pot is excellent.  But in composing the final order, I deleted the original order for the coffee pot alone and, instead, purchased the same coffee pot and the recommended filters and the recommended glass knob for the coffee pot lid as a bundled purchase.  Well, the filters are fine, but when the coffee pot order arrived, it contained two coffee pots, and the glass knob from another vendor cannot be attached to this 2-4 cup coffee pot because the lid is solid metal --  there is no provision on the lid  for such a knob to be attached.    Note #1:  Subsequently, Amazon generously refunded the cost of the redundant coffee pot.  Note #2: This percolator coffee pot makes excellent coffee -- especially if you buy Peet's Sumatran.

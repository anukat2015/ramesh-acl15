Title: To Those Complaining About Overflow
Content:
To those people complaining about overflow with this machine I have a solution. Melitta, the inventor of the cone filter and cone filtered coffee making, will tell you that using a cone filter is very different than using a cupcake filter. The cone filter is designed to be used with a MUCH smaller amount of very fine grind coffee. Melitta recommends two level TEASPOONS, not tablespoons, of very fine grind coffee to each six ounces of water. Anyone complaining about overflow with this coffee maker is using way too much medium grind or whatever comes out of a coffee can.   
Try grinding your own beans with a burr mill style grinder set on the finest grind. I then use 25 grams (using a small postal scale) of very fine grind to a full 50 ounce pot. This 50% rule of thumb holds for smaller amounts of coffee too, 20 grams for 40 ounces of water. Weighing the coffee is actually much simpler and easier than measuring with a teaspoon, you just add coffee till you get to the right weight.  
The coffee is PERFECT. I have never had any kind of overflow problem  with this Black and Decker machine.

Title: Stay away
Content:
What a useless machine this is: It is sinister how cheaply made this model is, with a motor too powerful for the flimsy plastic container it houses. Although it sucks plastic bags and book jackets like a storm, it fails to remove lint from the floor. While vacuuming, it heated up the room so much so, that on a hot day, I couldn't keep on working after only 5 minutes of it. But the worse was that the plug and outlet were so hot to the touch, that no doubt had I not came on time to unplug it, it might have started an electric fire. It went right back to where it came from leaving me the worse for shipping costs.

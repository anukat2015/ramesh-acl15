Title: Buy a book.
Content:
It doesn't come with any instructions.   Customer service is non existant.  When I tried to get a call back from tech support I got an e-mail saying they were sorry they missed me.. they sent it "before" the scheduled call time.  Since I was waiting for the call, I know that nobody tried to call.  When I tried to schedule another call, I got informed that if I wanted to talk to a support person I would have to pay for a "plan".  According to them, it has something to do with the model I purchased.  My first Apple experience... not a good one.

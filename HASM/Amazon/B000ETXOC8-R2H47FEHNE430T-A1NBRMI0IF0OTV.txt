Title: Ok MP3 Player.
Content:
I bought my Sansa 2 GB at Radioshack and 2 weeks later it went into an incredibly little interface crash and has been irresponsive ever since, the player does not want to work at all and the 14 day return policy expired (before you buy please check if there is any return policy) Other than that enjoy the little life it has. Its a very good mp3, i loved the earbuds!

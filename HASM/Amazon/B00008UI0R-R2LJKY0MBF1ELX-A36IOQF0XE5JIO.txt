Title: The Hoover Wind Tunnel Electric Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
"The Price is Right"...pardon the pun...and so is just about everything else, as far as I'm concerned.
Good power and maneuverability, storage for extra pieces is fine. Sections fit together easily - and it doesn't take up too much room in the closet.
My dogs still chase the machine...but then terriers will chase just about anything.
Good job all around for the Hoovers for manufacturing the vacuum and for Amazon for their fast delivery and good price,

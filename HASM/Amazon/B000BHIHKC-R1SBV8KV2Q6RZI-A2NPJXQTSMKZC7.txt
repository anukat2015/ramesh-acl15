Title: WORST coffee machine ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I purchased this machine for my desk at work because I wanted a quick way to make coffee that didn't end up making a mess. The result was a machine that makes hot brown water. I tried several different settings suggested by people online, but nothing made this machine produce something that tasted remotely like coffee. I am returning it to get my money back.
DO NOT BUY THIS THING!!!!! Write the company and demand they make a better product.

Title: I'm an IPod mini owner but...
Content:
this item does intrigue me. And by the way don't label the IPod owners as brainwashed when you're raving about a product you haven't even seen yet. And if you believe the battery will last 12 hours just cuz Creative says it will, they YOU'RE brainwashed. Also, Creative is NOT the first to market this kind of MP3 player. They followed after the PJB-100 from Hy-Tek or Hango or someone like that. I had one of those (paid thru my nose) and later I had the Creative Jukebox. The Jukebox I owned was a piece of garbage. The user interface was either insanely poor, or it was malfunctioning upon arrival. It stopped working completely after a few months. So I'm a bit leary about the zen micro.
However, comparing it to my IPod mini, I seem some positives:
1.) Modular battery.
2.) FM radio.
3.) Possibly better buttons. (never liked the IPod wheel)
I wonder if the buttons operate as well as the IPod's wheel, which can be a nuisance sometimes. Cuz when your trying to use it for a button sometimes it thinks your trying to use it as a wheel. And I don't think anybody has ever improved on the good old standard volume dial. But for surfing thru lists, or very long recordings, the IPod wheel rules.
One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable.
I am interested in the zen. But I'd really have to check it out in person first before being convinced one way or the other.
Can anyone who OWNS an IPod and a Zen comment on the relative sound quality? That's a big issue for me and if it does sound better, I might consider trying out the zen and possibly EBaying my IPod mini.

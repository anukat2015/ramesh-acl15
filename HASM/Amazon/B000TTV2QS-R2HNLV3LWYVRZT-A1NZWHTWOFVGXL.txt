Title: Powerful Little Heater
Content:
This is my 4th Lasko heater and I have 2 fans for cooling. All have worked flawlessly. I have yet to have any completely fail or have any electrical problems. What I have found is there are filters that need cleaning and in most cases not easy to clean completely. So over time( 1 - 2 years of heavy usage) the filters get so dirty they don't work as well but still work.
If you have two prong outlets and have to use a 3 prong adapter that adapter will get hot and sometimes melt. Change them often. These are high juiced units so check your cords and outlets often for heat. If the cord or plug get hot your problem is ( from my experience ) something to do with your outlet, extension cord. etc. If your outlets are not grounded, as in many older houses, that could be a problem. Cover your bases, clean all filters the best you can and you will have a fan or heater that will give great service.
The first time I used this particular unit it raised my living room temp by 4 degrees in 10 min. or less on a very cool day. It heats very well to say the least !
P.S. Use your vaccume cleaner attachment for cleaning the filters.

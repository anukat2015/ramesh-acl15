Title: This Super Compact Portable Air Conditioner Works Great!
Content:
I purchased an ACP-1000H a few months back for my apartment but needed something even smaller than that for my brother's dorm room.  That's when I found out that Air-N-Water.com had a newer, slimmer unit out -- the AC-10000E.  We purchased this a few weeks ago and was so surprised when we opened up the box.  This portable air conditioner is TINY!  It fit into my brother's cramped dorm room just fine and works really well for its size.  It also has some extra features such as a timer and remote for convenience.  Overall, I'm satisfied with this air conditioner.

Title: Very Pleased
Content:
Just got it out of the box today and took a few test pics. Got it as a replacement for my XTi, which I had lost.  So far I'm very impressed with the camera, but I've only taken a few indoor, low-light pics so far.  The camera feels solid and has all the features the enthusiast would need.  As others have mentioned it doesn't have quite the best ergonomic fit because the grip is a bit small, but it didn't affect my 5-star rating.  
Very impressed with the Image Stabilizing Lens.  It kicks the butt of the Tamron that I had on my XTi.
Its currently June 2009, and as I write this I have to say I was thinking of getting an XS, but at the moment the XSi does not cost that much more, and Canon has a great deal at the moment where if you get the kit together with an Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 II Lens for EOS Digital SLR Rebel XT, XTI, 20D & 30D Digital Camerasm IS lens you get $200 off of the purchase price, where with the ES you can get a different lens for $100 off, effectively making both combos about the same price on Amazon.  Either way, if you are OK with having the extra hassle of changing lenses, this promotion makes it a lot more affordable to have a range of 18mm to circa 200mm than buying a mega zoom lens like I had before.  Pictures will be better too since each lens is more dedicated.

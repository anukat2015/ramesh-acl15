Title: Good value, but a bit noisy.
Content:
Good value. It works well, it's light and compact. However it's a bit noisy. I wanted a discreet heater to use in my office, and it's not really quiet. One security feature includes a button under the heater which will turn off the heater if it rolls over. However, it will also turn off the heater if it stand on a soft surface (like carpet) which can be annoying.

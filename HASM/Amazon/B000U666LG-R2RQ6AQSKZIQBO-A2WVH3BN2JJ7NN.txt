Title: Does not heat up enough
Content:
I put this Heater on my computer desk and its about 6 inches from me.  At its highest heat level it pumps out hardly any heat and I'm totally disappointed with the product.  For the price it was a total waste of money.  Another issue is that the cord is so short that it limits where you can put it.  I had thought about putting it on the floor to warm my feet but you'd have to use an extenstion cord (which the product literature does not recommend) to be able to plug it in.
I am truly disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.

Title: GREAT for 1 person !!
Content:
I really like this coffee maker !!  It brews fast & coffee is hot.  The only thing I have found that does not work in this machine is the use of very fine ground coffee.  Like the size of a salt grain.  It is too dense for the water to filter thru & so it overflows into the water chamber & makes a real mess.  + coffee grounds in your cup & etc.   Cleaning the entire maker after that is a real chore, so use regular ground coffee to avoid this. The silver, insulated mug keeps it hot for quite a while also.  I got this machine 5 days after I ordered, so it was real fast !!  I think this makes coffee better than some of the small 4-cup makers out there.  + you use less coffee & NO filter's to buy, as this 1 has it's own washable filter. From to start to finish it is fast brewing & has an automatic shut off feature.  For 1 person, you can't go wrong w/ this maker, & the price is worth it.

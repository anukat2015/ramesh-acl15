Title: VAIO better than MacBook Pro
Content:
When we bought a top of the line MacBook Pro we had nothing but one problem after another for many weeks. The "Genius" people at Apple stores gave us incorrect information, did not comprehend the problems and the only way we solved them was to go to an outside company (INTUIT) who furnished the answers. Then we taught the information to the "Genius" Apple people. If one is not doing graphics, the MAC franchise really knows very little.
Contrast that experience to the Sony VAIO we just bought from Amazon. Right out of the box everything worked great. The hardware performed exactly as represented. In addition, when you put the screen next to the MAC it is sharper and easier to read.
In terms of price the VAIO is a much better buy than the overpriced MacBook. When the hype dies away from Apple products there will still be solid vompanies like SONY producing a great product.

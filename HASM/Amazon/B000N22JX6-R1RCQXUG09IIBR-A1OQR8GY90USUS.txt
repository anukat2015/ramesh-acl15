Title: looks cool. works great.
Content:
This item was purchased for a drafty office in a 1960's office building.  It was chosen for the design and color to coordinate well with the furnishings.  The heater sits at one end of the 10 x 15 office and heats very well, thanks to the oscillation feature.  The remote is handy since the desk is at the other end.  Design may not work in every room but for this office, it fits beautifully!

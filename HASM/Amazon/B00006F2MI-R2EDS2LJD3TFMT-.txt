Title: Too much effort
Content:
I got this as a gift to replace the Braun I got in college over 15 years ago.  I thought it would be great to wake up to coffee already made every morning... and it was for the first two days, then you start to dread getting it set up the night before.  It really is a long process.  There are too many parts you have to have clean and dry completely every single time you want some coffee.It might not seem like such a chore if the coffee you got from this machine was amazing, but that's not the case.  It's just coffee.  No better than what I brewed in my 15+ year old Braun.  I use bottled water every time, so maybe I would have noticed a difference if I used tap water since this machine has the filter and my old one does not.I am going back to my old Braun and will take this one out when the person who gave it to me comes over.

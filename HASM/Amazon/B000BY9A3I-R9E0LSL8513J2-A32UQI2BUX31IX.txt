This is my first time owning a canister vac.  Usually a big fan of uprights - don't like dragging the vac behind me, but I have to say it works perfectly.  It picks everything up off the hardwood floors and the beater attachment works very well on the rugs.  Would definitely recommend, especially for the price!

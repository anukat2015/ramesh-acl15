Title: Dirt canister needs to be emptied too often
Content:
I purchased this vacuum based on reviews.  It does have good suction and lots of nice features ~ I can't disagree with that.  These are what I think are the cons:  Dirt canister needs to be emptied after each room - if you have a dog that sheds a lot be ready for lots of trips to empty and the dog hair does not all go into the lower level.  Lots of it gets stuck around the hepa filter and has to be removed with your hands - yuck!  The hepa filter also gets cloged and needs to be cleaned each time vacuum is emptied.  If find I have to take it outdoors to remove the dirt from the filter as it blows around.  I tap the filter with a plastic item and the dirt get loosed and comes out after which I use a soft brush to further clean the filter.  This is major downside of this vacuum.  The filter can be washed but you can't use it while wet so it can't be washed till you have finished vacuuming.  I use a utility sink in my washroom to wash the filter - it is a dirty job.  Also, long hair and dog hair constantly clog the intake areas of both floor attachments.  I have a large home - 9 rooms - 4 kids - 1 cat and a shedding dog.  If you have a some area to vacuum and don't have many pets or children, then I think this would be a good vacuum for you. My kids hate emptying the dirt canister due to all that is involved.  Very good vacuum but dirt canister gets only 1 star.

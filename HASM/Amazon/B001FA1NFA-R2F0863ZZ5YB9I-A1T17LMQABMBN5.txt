Title: Nanochromatic... and somewhat flawed (3.5 stars)
Content:
I love the iPod.  Not only has Apple revolutionalized the way we listen to music by introducing THE ultimate music player (no more Discmans for me!), but it has grown and become robust each year.  Of course, we all know that once Apple releases something, other companies come out with similar gadgets with a few extras (I mean, look at what the iPhone has done to the cell phone.  It seems like every other cell phone now has a touch screen).  Now the Nano is in its fourth generation, displaying a smaller, lighter and more beautiful hardware complete with new features (accelerometer, available in 16GB, shake to switch songs, etc), and even though I love my new neon-pink Nano (would have preferred it in red, my favorite color, but they were out of said color at the store), it isn't perfect.  In fact, it is a bit of a nuisance.
What's wrong with it, you ask?  Nothing major.  However, I HATE the accelerometer on this device.  Even though it is perfect on my iPhone 3G, it is an unnecessary feature on the Nano.  I have disabled it.  After all, I don't want to rotate to Cover Flow whenever I turn it or if I'm moving about at the gym!  I also turn on the HOLD button because I don't want it to shake and switch songs/albums on me.  (You can disable this feature as well.)  All in all, I love the new colors, sound quality, larger storage (4th Gen Nanos are available in 8GB and 16GB) and weightlessness.  The other "improvements" are cosmetic and useless.

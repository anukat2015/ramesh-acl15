Title: Everything I expected and more...
Content:
I love this vacuum.  I have always stood true to my Hoovers, but wanted to try something new.  So far Bissell has not let me down with this particular vacuum.  Nor has Amazon!  It was shipped VERY fast... and I didn't even need the directions to put it together. (They were included however.)  All but three screws and vwalaa... my 2 yr old could have figured out where to put them.  It comes with a few handy attachments that I haven't gotten to test yet... but they all fit neatly onto the vacuum without being in the way.  The attachment hose is VERY long... which is great because the vacuum itself is bulky and I def. wouldn't want it tipping over.  It literally pulls itself though... so despite its size, it is not hard to move about the room.  The extra pet hair extractor on the front is an excellent option and I truly trust that my carpet is hair free when I put my kids down on the floor to play.  The vac does require some pretty regular cleaning to keep the pet hair from clogging it up (haven't had this problem, but assume it could be?)... BUT anyone that actually would expect a maintenance free vac with the demands of indoor pets and children would have to be crazy.  Naturally... any machine is going to need some TLC to keep performing top notch.  So far... no complaints from me.  Great job Bissell!

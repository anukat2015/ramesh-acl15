Title: Very Happy
Content:
For starters this was the first thing that I have purchased that I can remember where the owners manual is printed in all English and no other language. That in itself made it worth the price. It is great that you can set the temperature and not have to worry about it over heating. I am very pleased with the way Sun Tech takes care of their customers.  I look forward to doing more business with Sun Tech in the future.
Sincerely,

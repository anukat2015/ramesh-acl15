Title: awesome little player!!!!!
Content:
This is the best mp3 player I've ever owned!!!it holds my photos, ebooks, audio books, tons of music! it even holds a couple movies!!!! little tip: to put movies/videos on launch the coby media manager right away, drop and drag any movie you want into the movies folder then right click and hit synchronize.  the coby media manager will change the video to the correct format and load it onto your player for you!!! This is the easiest player I've ever had.  Loading videos and everything else on my player was a cinch!!! I would recommend anyone get this player! and for the price you can't beat it!!!

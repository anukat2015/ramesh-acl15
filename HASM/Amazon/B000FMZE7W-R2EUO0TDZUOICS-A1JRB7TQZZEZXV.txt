Title: Terrible software makes a decent player unusable. :(
Content:
The zune is a decent product, almost as good as the iPod, in fact, and cheaper usually. Unfortunately, I've owned one and have found out that the software is so buggy, so inefficient, so difficult to use and counterintuitive, I can't actually use this decent MP3 player. I've sold it, and am MUCH happier with my Creative Zen.
The software randomly deletes and syncs files for no apparent reason, skips albums, won't sync podcasts, and ONLY allows zune specific WMV's. (Try finding a lot of video files, trailers, etc in Zune format. It's difficult, at best.) I literally knew I couldn't keep wasting my time with this horrible an interface, so I sold it.
2-3/10

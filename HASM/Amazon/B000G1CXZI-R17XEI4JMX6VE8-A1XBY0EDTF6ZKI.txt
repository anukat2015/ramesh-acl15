Title: has potential
Content:
Great design, had hoped it would work better than it does. Gives off noxious odor even after putting in garage for 2 weeks. Electric bill jumped up $50 during those two weeks. The one I bought could be a defective fluke but Amazon won't refund  because it contains a flammable liquid(oil).Have to go through manufacturer which has been a pain also. Please keep this in mind when buying something like this. I have other DeLonghi heaters bought elsewhere and they work great.

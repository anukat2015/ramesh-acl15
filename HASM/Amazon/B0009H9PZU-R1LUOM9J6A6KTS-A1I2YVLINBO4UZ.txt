Title: Get Ready To Rock Out !!
Content:
I did all my research before getting an iRiver.  At first I was dead set on having a "flash player."  Concerned about moving around with a hard drive device.  However I don't jog with it and during my work-out routine, I place the player in a belted tune holder.  Nice & secure !
I had no problems with reading over the directions and getting this up and running.  I also found some very useful sites for added info.  Just run a search for iRiver Forums.  I was one of those people that had a hard time going from cassette tapes to CD's....LOL !   I truly wish I had bought a mp3 player a long time ago.
I chose the H10 (20 GB) because I know it will be a long time before I have to do any upgrading.  This device has everything !  The sound will BLOW YOU AWAY !!I also wanted to be sure that I had something that would be compatible with any of the music sites.  Mainly for the "All You Can Eat" music downloads.
I bought mine at Best Buy store.  I was willing to settle for the....  1 GB version.  But at the time they were offering a free $30.00 gift card with purchase of the H10, and free two month subscription to Napster.   So basically for an extra $75.00 bucks I could go from 1 GB to 20 GB.   Too good to pass up. 
 
I have read complaints about the scroll bar.  DON'T use it like a regular computer scroll bar.....Just press either the top or bottom of it.  If your searching it will pick up speed very fast !
I do believe that as we get close to Christmas we will see newer models of all types coming out.  I suspect to see everything else slowing dropping in price.  :)

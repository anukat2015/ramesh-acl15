Title: Great little heater!
Content:
I switched from an oil furnace as my primary heat source to a pellet stove in the living room.  That works great, but when I need to shut the bedroom door, my bedroom gets cold. I put this heater in a corner, turned it on and was warm almost instantly.  It is very quiet.  I really like the safety features on this and it is small enough to be unobstrusive.  Have bought more for the basement.  Great deal!

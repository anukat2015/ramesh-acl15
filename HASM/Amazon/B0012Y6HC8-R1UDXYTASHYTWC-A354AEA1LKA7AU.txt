Title: Xsi good camera good price
Content:
I am a pro shooter who got this camera to use for fun and trips were i would be mad if i damaged my high end $$$ body.(like skiing) Any way i love the camera so far. I have not had the problems that i have read about with the auto focus or image quality. You however can not take this camera out of the box and get the best pictures it can take. they will be ok but you need to take the time and set up your camera. READ the book if you dont know what your doing. I got the kit camera with the 18-55 IS lens and it is ok. The camera takes much better pictures with my 35-350 72mm L lens on it, as will any camera, spend your money on the glass not the body. 
If you want a good camera for the price this is the one for you. If you have older EOS cameras your old lenses will work with the new camera. I also use my 430EZ flash that is from my A2 EOS film camera, it is way over powering in the auto mode (as it is not a E-TTL flash only a TTL) but it works if you manual set it, for inside i use 1/16 or 1/32 (up to 10-15 feet works great) out side i set it to full power and i can light up a subject 100 feet away! (it is great for that) 
If you have used a EOS before this works about the same. even from my old film EOS to this one, the basic-mid advance functions are the same. 
BEWARE were you but from online. do not buy from a company who dose not have a good reviews (reviews not rating, and read the bad ones too). Personally i will not buy from 17st photo out of NY, to many nightmare stories . i try to buy from amazon directly and will do a lot of review reading if my item is supplied by anyone other than them.  Spend a few extra $$ to make sure you can send it back it their are any problems. you will get what you pay for.

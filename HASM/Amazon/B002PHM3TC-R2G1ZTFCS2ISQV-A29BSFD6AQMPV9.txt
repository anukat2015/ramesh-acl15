Title: Great machine, and good value
Content:
I would agree with all the reviews posted so far.
The product itself runs very quickly, especially for an ultra-portable. For simple tasks - word processing, web browsing - the specs are more than adequate. 
The main reason for purchasing this though was as a light-weight long battery-life option for travel and watching movies on the road. For this, it fits the bill to a tee. I only have a few criticisms: 
- Screen colors do not appear to be faithful. 
When I compare my partner's recently purchased macbook side-by-side, some of the colors, especially the oranges, seem a bit washed out. I've tried to rectify this with Windows 7's color calibration, with limited success.
- Glossy finish
As mentioned by others, the glossy finish looks nice initially, but soon gets really smudged. Some recommendations on a skin or tight case, anyone?
- Touchpad awkwardly positioned
When using the notebook on my lap, it's hard to manipulate the touchpad effectively.  
I also had the product on pre order for a few weeks, expected it to arrive in December, but received it last week. Thank you, Amazon!

Title: Great Value and Performance
Content:
My Toshiba bit the dust and I needed to get another laptop. I studied the market and found this Acer with a 14 inch screen and the Windows 7 operating system. I have had the computer for a month now and I am very happy with my purchase. It is light and powerful. The over 8 hour battery life might be a stretch,the battery seems to last for over 6 hours. 
I would recommend this without any hesitation. I use this computer at least 6 hours every day and have not found anything it will not do.

Title: A BIG ADJUSTMENT
Content:
After being a Minolta film photographer for 30 years, I finally went digital.(OK....Some of us men are set in our ways!!) After reading the owner's manual, one of the first of several things that I liked about this camera, was the fact that I can adjust the diopter. Being a near-sighted photographer, this meant that I can shoot pictures, without my glasses. What sold me on the Sony DSLR, was the fact that when Sony bought Minolta, they wanted to make the Minolta photographer happy, by making the Sony body fit the Minolta AF lens system. Also depending on which Minolta AF flash unit that you have, it will work with the A200.
In shooting weddings, with the 2GB compact flash card that I have, it will feel kind of nice not worrying about how long, before I have to change the film. As for the results.....I'M IMPRESSED!! For you Minolta fim SLR photographers, who want to go fully digital, this is the camera for you.

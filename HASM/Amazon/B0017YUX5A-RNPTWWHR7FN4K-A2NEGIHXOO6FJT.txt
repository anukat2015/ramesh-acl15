Title: i have never been excited about a cleaning appliance but this vac is awesome
Content:
i am an artist, a sculptor, and i live in my studio. i work with wood, found objects and other things that bring in a lot of dirt to my studio/living space. my floor is a polished cement and i have a few areas of very low carpet (at the garage ramped entrance). this vacuum cleans it all extremely efficiently. it is easy to move about the space and the canister easily lifts so that i can get into weird places. furthermore, even when the bag is almost full of dirt and sawdust, the suction does not diminish. the attachments are functional each for their task. and there is this little extra attachment that works well on upholstery.
i hate cleaning and hate spending money on that kind of stuff but this vac put a smile on my face. i researched it on consumer reports and am glad i went with their rec. i thought about getting the bag-less version but am glad i didn't because i would have to change the filter all the time and bags are much cheaper and suction is constant.

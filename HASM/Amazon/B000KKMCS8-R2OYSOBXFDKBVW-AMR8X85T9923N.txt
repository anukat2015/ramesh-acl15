Title: worth replacing
Content:
As a long time pelonis owner, I replaced it with a new pelonis that is very much like the original. The first one lasted at least 15 years. It would have been senseless to replace it with something inferior. We use it in conjunction with central heat, to keep the central heat from warming up areas we are not occupying. This also helps with the utility bill.

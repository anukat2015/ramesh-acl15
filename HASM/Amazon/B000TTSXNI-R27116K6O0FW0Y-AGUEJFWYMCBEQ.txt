Title: Lasko Ceramic Tower heater
Content:
I purchased this because when I researched space heaters, they say that ceramic is safer than the others.  I liked the fact that you could program temperatures, that it has a timer, that it can be set to rotate, and that it has a remote control.  This works very well and it is quiet too.  It is not heavy at all, so you can move it where you want it.

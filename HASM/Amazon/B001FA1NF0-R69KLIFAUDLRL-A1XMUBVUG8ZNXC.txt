Title: Apple iPod nano 16 GB Orange (4th Generation)
Content:
Everything works according to Ipod's website EXCEPT the battery life. DON'T BELIEVE the 24 hour ipod's website profess it to be, specially if you skip songs or use the shuffle to switch songs. It will CUT DOWN your battery life to 2-3 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT AD IS MISLEADING

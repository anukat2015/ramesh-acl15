Title: Works fine for us
Content:
I had 2 of these heaters already but our gas furnace went out and I got a couple more while taking care of the main heat.
The thermostats worked well, they are quiet, and they heat a room nicely.
Electric bill went up some but I wasn't burning any propane during that time so maybe it offset.
Nice little heaters. Too bad they don't make that particular model any more.

Title: Good,but not enough power
Content:
Heats up objects fast but since its only a maximum of 800 watts I found that it did not provide enough heat for 1 average size room on its own in winter. Seems more effective in milder late winter and early spring weather. kept small bathroom warm in winter and required only the 400 watt setting in late winter/early spring. Worked well for its power rating in a larger rectangular space.

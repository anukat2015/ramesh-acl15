Title: great coffee maker, HORRIBLE water filter design
Content:
The coffee maker makes great coffee and is easy to operate and clean.  One caveat - the water filter device is awkward to say in the least, and required that I use a screwdriver to pop it open, and then of course that only scrathes it up and makes it even harded to open the next time.  Simple solution - throw the filter out.  The coffee maker seems to be operating just fine, and making just the same good cup(s) of coffee.

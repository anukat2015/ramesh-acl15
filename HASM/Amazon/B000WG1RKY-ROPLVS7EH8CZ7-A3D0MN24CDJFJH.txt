Title: Finally joined the 21st century...
Content:
...and got a Zune.  I'd wanted to get an iPod for a couple of years, but was gun-shy with the price.  The Zune was about $40 cheaper and I knew could hook it up to my Xbox 360, so I went ahead and picked an 8 GB version up.  I have not regretted my decision.  The controls are easy to use, the software is easy to use, the screen is small but the images are crisp.  I am really enjoying it!  I've had it about 3 weeks and have had no issues so far.  I ordered a silicone case and armband off of amazon, which has also been a good addition (since it doesn't come with a case).

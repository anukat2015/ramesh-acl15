Title: Keurig B60 Coffee Brewer
Content:
We love this coffee brewer! Took a little while to figure out cup sizes and brew strength, but once we crossed that bridge we brew like old pros. The convenience of one-cup brewing is great. Now, instead of tossing out old, burnt coffee and brewing a fresh pot, or discarding leftovers, we only brew what we drink...and it's always fresh!
We have used large mugs for coffee for many years. This system uses a more standard size cup for reference, so our initial cups of coffee were less than what we were accustomed to. However, we pressed on to find a balance we could live with.
We also like our coffee strong, so we had to find the best fit for our tastes. To that end, we use Green Mountain Dark Magic and Green Mountain French Roast set on the large cup size. These two blends deliver a great cup of coffee in either regular or decaf.
We heartily recommend this product. If you like good coffee with lots of variety, the Keurig system is for you.

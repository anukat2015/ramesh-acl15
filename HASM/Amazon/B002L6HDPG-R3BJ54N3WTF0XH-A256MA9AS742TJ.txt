Title: Next Best Thing to the iPod Touch
Content:
Love the Nano! It's perfect to throw in your pocket and roll out. The storage capacity puts it on par with the iPod Touch b/c you can watch all the same videos, TV shows, and movies--and still have a ton of music to listen to. The pedometer is a great feature, although it drains your battery if you leave it on all day. The radio is marvelous b/c I don't always want to listen to downloaded music. And as long as you have a good pair of headphones reception should be clear. I haven't found anything that I don't like about my Nano. It's my on-the-go media player. I have a Touch for long trips. It's a great little machine, easy to use, and full of features that most folks will enjoy. If you don't have the money to drop on a Touch, I think you'll be satisfied with a Nano.

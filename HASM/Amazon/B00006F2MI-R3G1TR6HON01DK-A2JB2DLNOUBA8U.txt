Title: Excellent coffee maker
Content:
Excellent coffee maker at a great price.  This is my second one.  The first one started to leak, but it did get used hard.  I got four good years out of it.  It's quick to grind the beans and actually uses less coffee per pot than using ground coffee.  The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot all day.  It's still warm the next morning!

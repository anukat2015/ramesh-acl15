Title: So Sad
Content:
I had this coffee maker for about a year and LOVED it. Even after it suddenly quit working a couple of months after the warranty was out, I thought it must be a fluke and got another one. Lo and behold, this morning I have no coffee. Same deal. After about 14 months of use it died. Here's the real kicker, this is my THIRD Cuisinart in 5 years to do this, I had another model that broke before these two. Some people never learn!

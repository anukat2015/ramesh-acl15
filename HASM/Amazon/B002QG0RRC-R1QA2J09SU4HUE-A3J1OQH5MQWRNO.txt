Title: I must have bought a Lemon
Content:
I really wanted this coffee maker to work, it is great in theory and had pretty good reviews.  The water pump in mine would not work.  The machine produced enormous amounts of steam and condensation, but no coffee.  I read and re-read the instructions and tried every possible programming option, but still only a tiny bit of black syrupy coffee in the pot after 45 minutes of sputtering steam.  So I gave up and sent it back to the great people at Amazon.  One day I spotted the Capresso 455 in TJMaxx at a much reduced price.  It is the older version of the 465 and works fine.  I can't give the 465 a bad review because mine had a faulty water pump, but I can say the 455 is great.

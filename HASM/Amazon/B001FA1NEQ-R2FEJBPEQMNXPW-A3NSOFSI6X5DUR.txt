Title: Don't buy it!
Content:
I misplaced my older ipod (I have since found it) and bought this tiny ipod.  It is so light I had it on the edge of the sink and the weight of the cord pulled it into the water.  I pulled it out in a fraction of a second and dried it off.  It still operated but in the morning it was dead.  What apple doesn't do is give any warning that any moisture will destroy it right away and they have a built in moisture alarm that voids the warranty by turning red (inside the ear plug jack). I checked on-line and there are other problems with class action litigation on this model.  The screen gets scratched and marred easily, and the battery does not last as advertised.  Also, if you set the ipod down on its side, it goes into a display mode and you can't adjust volume.  Also if you set it down too hard in shake mode, it shuffles the song. Apple has some serious water intrusion engineering to do on this.  When my old ipod wears out, I am going to another make of mp3 player.

Title: Burned
Content:
We never even plugged it in.  We bought the heater for a bathroom, but when we read the manual it stated very clearly that it is not suitable for use in a bathroom.  So, we returned it at our expense & received a refund, less a 10% restocking fee.  We lost about 25% of our money.  The real cause of the problem was lack of info in the online product description.  We would not buy any product made by this company again.  Also, the vendor was very difficult to deal with, but evently agreed to let us return the heater.

Title: This vacuum sucks --- real good.
Content:
I bought this vacuum because I live with two cats in a partially carpeted home.  Much of my furniture is always covered with cat hair.  This vacuum comes with a component with a small moving brush designed to clean furniture.  I love everything about this quiet vacuum cleaner.  Here are a few items where Hoover can do to improve it.  The manual should indicate where some of the components are stored inside the vacuum cleaner. These are very well concealed and when I received my first delivery, I sent it back because I thought I received an incomplete item.  It was only when I received my second vacuum that my girlfriend noticed there was a hidden compartment where the components where stowed.  Also, the manual does not indicate how to fit the components.  The way these components fit in the handle does not seem like a natural fit. They do fit, but I wasn't sure if I did it right.  I also wish it had a pivoting hose that turn in place instead of ending up with a twisted hose.  Good suction power with a button to choose power level and a large lighted display that indicates which level you're on.  The controls on the handle are very convenient and ergonomically designed.  Very easy to assemble.  It took me less than five minutes.  It's easy to clean the canister and easy to observe that it has been filled to the max.

Title: I love this camera!
Content:
I researched all the cameras available and read reviews. I went to a local store and they let me take photos with the different cameras there in their store. I chose the D50 and I am very happy with my choice. 
I just got it and was able to take great pictures at the local race track. Standing in the center of the track, not 20 feet from the passing cars, I was able to freeze the car as if sitting still. Clear and Crisp. I absolutely love this camera.

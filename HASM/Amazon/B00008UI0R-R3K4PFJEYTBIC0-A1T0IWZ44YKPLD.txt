Title: This is the best bagless Canister around
Content:
This Vacuum has a lot of power and a really long cord to make it easier to clean several different places without changes outlets.  The only problem I have is I have to empty the container that hold the dirt frequently.  I guess my house is really dirty, plus I have two cats and a dog and the pet hair builds up fast in the dirt holder.

Title: Tiny, Sleek HD Player for my HDTV
Content:
Apple always makes the coolest hardware, well this time Microsoft Zune HD hardware is even better than Apple's MP3 players(I used to own an iPod Touch in the past) considering small form factor, sleekness and functionality. Zune HD is Tiny, Sleek and plays great HD videos on my 40 inch Samsung LCD TV, I have never seen a tiny device playing great HD video on a big sceen TV. I downloaded HD Movies and HD Video PodCasts from Zune's marketplace. Overall very impressed with touch screen user interface, smoothness and rest of the functionality. I hope in future ZUNE will open up marketplace for third party apps. 
I guess iPod Touch and Zune HD are the best MP3 players in the market, the main differences I see is iPod Touch got more accessories option and Apps but Zune HD can play HD Video on a big screen TV.
I chose to buy Zune HD over iPod Touch because I travel a lot so I can use Zune HD as a pocketable DVR to watch movies, video podcast, TV shows
in Hotel Room TV.
Bluetooth could have been a great addition, so that I can use Zune HD like a touchscreen remote control and stream audio to my Samsung Sound Bar via Bluetooth connection.

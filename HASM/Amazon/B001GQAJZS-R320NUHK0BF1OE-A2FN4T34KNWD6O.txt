Title: Mine only worked for two weeks.
Content:
Pros:
Compact
Lightweight
Portable
Sufficient for a mobile pc, but the current field is getting crowded with many other manufacturers offering similar products, and many that are much better.
Cons:
Internal drive went bad within 2 weeks.
Would no longer boot - "Operating System Not Found"
Sent the unit back twice for repair, and was returned BOTH times with the same problem as if it was never touched.
Finally requested a replacement unit, and am now still waiting on the replacement.

It is currently December 1, 2008, and I do not have a working Dell Mini 9 that I ordered on 9/10/2008.
Purchase from DELL with care. With the sheer number of other manufacturers with similar (and even more powerful) MINI computers, do your homework.
I actually requested a refund if I returned the product and was told I had to have returned it within 21 days. I didn't even have the computer in my hands that long, but Dell was not willing to give me a refund.

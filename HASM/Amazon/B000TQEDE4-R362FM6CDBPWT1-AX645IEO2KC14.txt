Title: Mediocre product very overpriced
Content:
My old BrewStation died and I decided to try this one.  Used it one time and am decidedly unimpressed.  It has too many parts, too many buttons and is unnecessarily complicated.
I dislike the opaque carafe, cannot see how much coffee is in it.  The electrics are a recipe for failure...no decent engineer would ever put a rotary switch on the front panel of a kitchen appliance and the controls are anything but intuitive.  The beeping is annoying and the lcd display is virtually invisible without some good ambient lighting...the 'fill indicating window' is badly located back on the right side and can't be seen without twisting the whole thing around.  It's designed to use hard-to-find 'odd sized' filters (although you can use standard ones if you can spare a couple minutes to re-fold them
to fit the funnel-shaped holder.)  I've decided to relegate it to the camping trailer and resurrect our old Mr. Coffee which cost a third as much and makes every bit as good a pot of coffee.  This is a horrible product.

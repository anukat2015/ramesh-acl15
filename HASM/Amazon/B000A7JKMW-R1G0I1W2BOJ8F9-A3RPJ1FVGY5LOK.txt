Title: An excellent DSLR
Content:
I've been using my Maxxum 5D for about a month now and could not be more impressed.  It has excellent ergonomics, great features (like antishake), and of course, produces high quality images.  I moved up from a Canon point and shoot and I really appreciate these features: 1) no shutter lag, 2) long battery life, 3) great low-light performance, 4) interchangeable lenses, 5) RAW format support.  I am shooting only RAW these days and using Photoshop Elements 3.0 to do the conversion to JPEG.  While it is true the camera will usually do a good job, with RAW you have a good chance to fix that important picture where the exposure and white balance is just wrong.
On the lens front I'm using: 1) 18-70mm kit lens (wide but inexpensive), 2) Minolta AF 50mm f/1.7 lens - great for portaits and low-light 3) Tamron 28-200mm XR - a good all-around and compact lens.
I look forward to many years of usage from this camera.  I certainly hope Sony picks up support for the Minolta system.

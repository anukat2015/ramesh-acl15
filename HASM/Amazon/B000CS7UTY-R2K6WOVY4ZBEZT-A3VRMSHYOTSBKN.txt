Title: A little hard to figure out. Zen M 30GB.
Content:
I bought this product just before the holidays. The directions are weak,I am still trying to figure out how to download movies to my zen,also which cables to buy, other wise the zen M is great.Excellent sound songs are good,graphics are excellent,and the color screen is bright and clear,even though it is a littlt hard to figure out,I still give the Creative Zen M, five stars. If anyone reading this review and know how to download movies and which cable to buy,please let me know.Thanks.

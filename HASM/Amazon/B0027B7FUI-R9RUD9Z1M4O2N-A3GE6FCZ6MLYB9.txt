Title: Don't impulse buy, read reviews first!
Content:
I really wish I'd read some reviews of this coffee maker before I bought one at the local kitchen store.  I got it because out of all the coffee makers there, only this one and a more expensive espresso machine had a removable water reservoir, which was the one feature on my wish list.  I've already had to take it back for a replacement after less than a month when it wouldn't brew, even after trying all the troubleshooting advice.  The carafe is nice and sturdy, but unless you pour VERY slowly, it spills over and makes a mess.  This wasn't just the first carafe, the replacement does the same messy dribble.  My one required feature of a removable water reservoir is also a bit clunky. It is too tall to fit nicely under my refrigerator's filtered water dispenser and it doesn't slide back in place very easily in the coffee maker.  This is an expensive coffee maker, so I was expecting much better quality.  It does brew decent coffee and does so fairly quickly, but the annoyance factors make me regret buying it.

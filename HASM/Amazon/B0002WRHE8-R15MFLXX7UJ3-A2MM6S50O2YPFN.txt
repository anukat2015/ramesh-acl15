Title: Handy Heater
Content:
The portable Big Buddy puts out plenty of heat.  We use it in a family room and it really takes the chill off on a cold morning.  The three heat settings are handy and on days that aren't real cold, the low setting is plenty.  The fan is a nice feature and allows one to direct the warm air.  It is a little noisy though.
The heater is a nice compact size.  We use it with a large propane tank, which is probably a good idea if you don't want to be changing tanks often.  It also has some very good safety features such as the low oxygen shutoff sensor and a feature that shuts it off if it gets knocked off.
We are very satisfied with this product. I would have given it five stars if not for the slightly noisy fan.

Title: Great coffee Great machine
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift. It is great looking with the other SS appliances in my kitchen. The programs work as stated and I love the 4 hour auto off function. The inner container for the coffee serves as a water pitcher when you first fill the machine. You must take care in filling the machine but with care it is no big deal. I love how every thing looks neat and clean but you still have hot coffee. Yes it is very hot coffee any hotter and you could not drink it.

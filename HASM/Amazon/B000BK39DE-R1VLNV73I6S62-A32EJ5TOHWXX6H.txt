Title: Falls Short of Expectations
Content:
I had high hopes for this one...  I have had an Olympus C-2100UZ for about 5 years and it has been a great camera, but I was ready to upgrade to a true digital SLR.  I have had very good 35mm SLR cameras for a couple decades and been a serious armature photographer.
This camera disappointed me.  It sure has an amazing number of features packed into it, but in the end a good camera boils down to photo quality, period, and the photo quality I get from this camera is not as good as I get from my C-2100UZ (a long ago deprecated 2MP model).
The E-500 does best outside with bright light, but inside it has serious focus and exposure problems.  The photo quality is more on par with an old 110mm camera, or a Polaroid.  They are just not at all crisp and clear as you would expect from a camera of this caliber.  The photos are either grainy or out of focus.  It uses the flash to create light for the auto-focus in low-light scenarios, which drives human subjects insane, and must just not really work very well.  I tried manual focus too and still it just doesn't take clear pictures inside.
Most professional reviews (e.g. PC Magazine) seem to echo the same...that this camera is okay, but just not quire there yet.
I returned this one and ordered a Nikon D50.  A lot more 3rd party lens options are available for it because it's built on existing standards.  Maybe the problem with the E-500 is the new "four thirds" lens system...and if so maybe they will eventually get that right, but for now, and for this kind of money, I suggest you buy the Nikon, or wait for the next generation Olympus DSLR but then still read the reviews to make sure they got it right.

Title: do not waste your money and time
Content:
Purchased this machine thinking it would be great as are all my other Cuisinart machines.  NOT!!!  A mess to clean up after EVERY use, grounds back up into grinder, coffee does not stay hot, and Cuisinart offers to send you a new one, (not the one without the grinder, which is great and cheaper) and expects you to pay $10. shipping and handling both ways.  Nice huh?  They did tell me how to soak the parts in detergent each time I use it to keep the coffee oils from jamming the grinder in its place and to use a Q-tip to clean around the stem.  PLEASE!  Cuisinart is clearly aware of the problems of this machine but they keep on selling them.  Does not mean you have to fall for it though.  I'll not use the grinder again.  Amazon should consider removing it from their list as well.

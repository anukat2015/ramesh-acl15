Title: Great camera for enthusiasts
Content:
I'm not going to spend a lot of time reiterating what everyone else has said about this camera.  It does have a few flaws, however I think given the overall value of the camera, it has been great to use.
This is my first DSLR, however my third SLR.  I have previously owned two Minolta film SLRs which were both great, but it became a hassle to develop photos for me.  I found that after I bought my digital point and shoot, the convenience of digital overcame the need to swap out lenses on a film camera.  Until now when I jumped to my new DSLR...
Therefore, this is an excellent camera for someone with experience with SLRs.  It works for a beginner, however I think newer models like the D3000 would be more suitable if you are just starting off since that camera is more geared towards holding your hand while shooting.  This camera has the user friendliness, but also has quite a few advanced features for those in the know or willing to learn.
The articulating screen is kind of a double-edged sword.  The fact that it swings down is nice as I've used it quite a few times to get some unique angles with the camera and when closed it protects the LCD from scratches.  But auto-focus in live view is very slow.  I recommend that you use LV only when framing a shot.  Once you have the shot set, turn off live view and then take the shot (best on a tripod).  The main negative to the swing down screen is that some tripods prevent rotating of the screen once the camera is mounted.  Fortunately my tripod's quick-release is shaped in a way that I can mount the camera and articulate the screen without hitting the tripod.  The other negative to the articulating screen is that its much smaller than the screen on the D90 and has a lower resolution.  It also is almost worthless to view pics if you are shooting outdoors.  There is quite a bit of glare in bright light as well as its hard to tell if the shot was what you wanted or not.  To me this is the single biggest complaint of the camera--good thing the screen doesn't affect the photo quality.
I've only shot one video with the camera.  I didn't buy a DSLR to shoot video, so this feature really does nothing for me.  And I'm guessing that more people are probably in the same boat as I am.
Pros:
-Excellent image quality
-Camera size is great for its portability
-Intuitive controls; easy to use for photographers with a good understanding of photography
-Great value
-Articulating screen and live view are great when used properly
-Will shoot video if you need it--its a nice feature but it isnt going to replace a dedicated video recorder.
Cons:
-Articulating screen can be annoying if you don't have the right tripod.
-Live view is worthless unless using it to frame up a shot.  Takes about 6-8 seconds to autofocus in LV mode
-LCD is not very good to view in bright light.
-The view finder is a bit dim--esp compared to the D90.
To sum things up, this camera is great for an 'advanced enthusiast' looking for a great value.  If you are a photographer who new, get a D3000.  If things like in body focusing motors and larger viewfinder are important to you, then I'd say its worth paying a few extra hundred on the D90.  But if you don't have an extensive Nikon non-AF lens collection, then I really don't see much reason to pay extra money for the D90 since the internals are all pretty much the same.

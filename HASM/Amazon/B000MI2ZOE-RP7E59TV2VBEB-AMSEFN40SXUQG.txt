Title: defective product
Content:
Unit operated for a day and a half. Even during this short time period the compressor was very noisy at startup and the fan sounded as if it was hitting something as it was speeding up. After this 36 hour period the unit would run for about 5 minutes and then just blow hot air. With so many other portable products available I would caution anyone thinking of buying this unit.

Title: There is nothing wrong with this product!
Content:
I have been using this coffee maker for almst SIX MONTHS now and it has NEVER spilled coffee all over my counter or blew coffee grounds everywhere or any of the other things most other people have whined about on here. I have to think the people who are having problems actually have no idea how to make coffee. If you're having trouble with the coffee spilling when trying to use the brew-through lid on the cup, then TAKE IT OFF and let the coffee brew right into the cup! That's not a difficult problem to try to get around!If grinds are getting into your coffee, just make sure you have the filter piece in it's container properly and make sure you rinse the coffee oil residue off it properly before using it again.I think the people who are giving this 1 star were just looking for some magic coffee machine that did everything for them instantly and got all huffy when they have a problem with it and can't use common sense to figure it out.

Title: turning an amateur photographer to Pro
Content:
first and foremost i wanted to thank my good friend KHQ for cutting me a sweet deal on this camera! i was really about to get into the SLR until i saw some of the photos he took with it. He apparently was opting for another camera which allowed me to get my grubby hands on this! I wish i would have gotten the Nikon School DVD, Fast, Fun and Easy III Featuring the Nikon D5000 Digital SLR to understand it immediately. But after messing with it in Dubai and after 800 varying pictures which leads me to believe i have a very long way in photography! But this camera has it all! you see creative sides of yourself with this!

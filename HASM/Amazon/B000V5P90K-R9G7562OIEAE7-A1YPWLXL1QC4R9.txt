Title: My wife will Kill me
Content:
I still like my point and shoot camera, but as I learned more about Photography I was unhappy with the camera noise generated. So I looked for something more fulfilling, and settled on the Canon 40D. Please read all the knowledgeable reviews, and see for yourself why I liked this camera. As earlier stated I am a point and shoot guy because I can slip the camera in my pocket. I got enough personal body weight to lug around, so I really didnt want a big clumsy camera hanging around my neck. This camera only weighs a pound and 1/2, I could live with that. I read all I could about this 40D, and I liked what it would allow me to do. When I decided that this was the camera for me. I was very patient and looked for coupons and deals, and finally found a price I could live with, but my wife would kill me if she knew how much I spent. The camera has lived up to all my expectations, I dont treat it like a fragile china, I purchased it to use it, and thats exactly what I do.  I use the camera in all types of weather. I have not been disappointed. the camera noise I complained about with my P&S is gone. My only real problem, is now other people want me to take pictures for them. . .Rats! they never asked when I use my point and shoot. Just like a comfy pair of shoes, this camera is High Priced, but a good buy.

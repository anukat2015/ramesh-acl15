Title: A few problems
Content:
I just bought the Zune 80 and now I'm kind of frustrated and shooting in the dark. There's absolutely no instruction book that I can find of any kind. It would be nice to know how to turn it on, create playlists, and do other functions. Also, what do you do when you're through playing it through your stereo? Do you take it out of the charging dock and turn it off? I'm not sure, because there's no guidance. But, after a couple of days of trial and error, I'm starting to figure it out. After finally creating playlists and listening to the music outside, I realized that different audio tracks play at different volume levels. This is totally unacceptable. Who wants to go inside and be continually adjust the volume? Microsoft wouldn't forget a volumne normalization feature, would they? That's my biggest complaint. Also, another reviewer didn't like the fact that you could not drop and drag from windows to the zune software. I agree. I think I'm going to take it back and get an IPOD Classic. It's my understand that the IPOD has volume normalization through a feature called Sound Check. I don't think the Zune is the right way to go for people who want it specifically for music.

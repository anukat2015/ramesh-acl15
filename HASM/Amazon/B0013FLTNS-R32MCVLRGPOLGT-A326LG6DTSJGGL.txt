Title: Pro in every sense...
Content:
This is my first MacBook. I have been saving and calculating a lot since the last few weeks (since I decided it's TIME to buy one...done with the waiting), but unfortunately could get to only the 13.3" version of MacBook according to my budget. Unfortunately coz I wanted a Pro (15.4"). Put a little here and there and luckily Amazon was giving one at price for which i could try. So I pushed my budget a couple hundred dollars more...and bought the MacBook Pro MB134LL/A 15.4-inch Laptop.
It's pro in every sense...250GB hard disk, 2.53 GHz Intel core 2 duo, 2GB RAM (you might say 4GB would have been greater, but with 6MB L2 cache,who needs that 2GB more)...and there is 512MB of NVIDIA GeForce DDR3 dedicated graphics card to help you run almost anything...

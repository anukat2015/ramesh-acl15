Title: 60GB iPod Video
Content:
The 60GB iPod Video is great.  The only thing I don't exactly like is the difficulty in getting personal(previously bought) dvd's loaded for viewing - it's not exactly user friendly to do that.  The purchased dvd's from the Apple store is fine, just a hassle to go the other way.  But all in all, I would recommend it.

Title: Excellent vacuum !
Content:
This is the best vacuum I've had yet for hard wood floors. I have 1 child, 2 cats ,a dog and a bird and it literally was a breeze on all of their mess, such as candy wrappers, hair, cat litter and seeds. We have a large townhouse and I could do the first-floor and steps without having to replug somewhere else. The dirt canister is larger than I thought it would be and the suction was great! It's also very easy to clean. It is lightweight and easy to handle and the micro-fresh filter only needs to be replaced 2 times a year ... (Now that makes me breathe easy). The only thing I can come up with that I would change on this vac is that it does not have a retractable cord.

Title: Evaporative cooler
Content:
I've had this cooler for about a week. It is very solid state. It has some drawbacks. All evaporative coolers need to be put in front of a window to draw in the hot air and be cooled through the water pad. This particular evaporative cooler, however, puts too much humidity into the room making it muggy. The other drawback is the filler spot is at floor level, so if you are elderly or have problems stooping, it may be a problem. I put mine on a table in front of a window, so it's not an issue. You need to turn the fan off before you fill it or water gets sprayed outward. My son has another brand of evaporative cooler which he only has to fill every couple of days. This Adobeair model needs to be filled every couple of hours. It can also be used as a fan.

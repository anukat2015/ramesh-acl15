Title: Gotta love Apple
Content:
Love my iPod--I don't require a ton of space for songs, so this is just the right amount of memory for me. Easy to sync to iTunes and operate even while running. The only slight complaint that I have is that the battery runs down even when it's not in use, so if I don't use it for a while and then pick it up for a run, the battery is drained already. But other than that, I love it!

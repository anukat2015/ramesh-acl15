Title: Great Kotatsu heater!
Content:
This certainly isn't marketed at people with a knowledge of thermodynamics.  It advertises that it uses 1/10 the heat of a space heater, but that means it also puts out 1/10 of the heat.
As as space heater I can see this thing being pretty poor because of its low heat output, but It worked perfectly for my application.  I used it for a makeshift kotatsu (a Japanese heated table)  It works great for that because you don't want 1000 watts cooking your feet.  Its really thin, and it won't burn you if you hit it with your knee.  It was a tad difficult to mount upside-down.  I cut out some wooden mounting blocks and screwed it directly into the bottom of the table.  They give you velcro to mount it vertically, which is a joke considering how heavy it is.

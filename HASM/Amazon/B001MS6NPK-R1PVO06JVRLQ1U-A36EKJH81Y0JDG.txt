Title: Great build quality
Content:
The build quality of this laptop is great, much better than the home-grade HPs and Dells I used to use. The laptop is quite fast in spite of a load of Sony bloatware. Windows System Rating in Vista is 3.8, may be because of the lack of a dedicated graphics card.
UPDATE: I bought two of these for my friends overseas. The display of one of them died after 6 months. She did not get warranty service as she is outside the United States.

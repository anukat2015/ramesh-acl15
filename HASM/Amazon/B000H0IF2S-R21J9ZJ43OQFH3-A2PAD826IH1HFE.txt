Title: I'm Won Over from being Totally Uninterested in an iPod
Content:
I listen to a lot of music, most of it classical. I review classical CDs here at Amazon. When my daughter-in-law gave me the iPod shuffle for Christmas I didn't even know what it was or what it was capable of. But since she showed me how to use it, how to download into it and the other little things one learns to do, I've become a convert. This little package of amazing engineering is a real jewel. My only concern is that I'll wear out my ears using it. 
I think the best thing about it that I can use it while working away in the wee hours when to have loudspeakers going would wake the family. And, of course, on walks, which are a regular feature of my life in this small town where one walks everywhere rather than drive just a few blocks. Just load up a program -- it's easy as pie to load the shuffle with a program that you're interested in -- and start walking. I've been able to use my expensive over-the-ear headphones with the iPod, being amazed that this little thing can drive those big headphone speakers. 
It loads quickly. Downloading an entire CD will take only five minutes if that long. Sound quality is just fine. I don't detect any significant degradation of the sound. 
My daughter-in-law is getting tired of me thanking her for the gift.

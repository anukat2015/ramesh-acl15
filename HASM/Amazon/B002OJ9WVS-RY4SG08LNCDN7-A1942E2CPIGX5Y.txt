Title: Miele S4212 Vacuum
Content:
I bought this vacuum after reading the reviews on Amazon and have been pleased with it to date.  It is definitely infinitely more quiet than my old Hoover and seems to have good pickup.  It's also very light and easy to maneuver.  My only criticism is that the attachments can't be stored inside of the vacuum but instead click into a rack that attaches to the outside. It invariably falls off as I am vacuuming.  My mom's ancient Miele has the "inside storage" feature and it's awesome.  Maybe that comes with the more expensive models?

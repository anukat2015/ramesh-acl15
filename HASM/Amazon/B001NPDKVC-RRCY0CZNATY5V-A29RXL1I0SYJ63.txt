Title: Dead after 5 Months
Content:
I bought this laptop because of the specs.  The case felt cheap and it did not play well with Windows 7, so I sold it to a friend on April 21, 2009.  Today (September 08, 2009) I get a call and she tells me the laptop is not turning on.  After looking on the Internet for "HP Laptop won't turn on" I find that this is a very common issue with HP laptops.
So her laptop is dead (I suspect the motherboard) and now we have to see how to get it fixed by HP, whose customer support is below mediocre.  Not a good purchase at all, buy a Macbook and run Windows 7 - better hardware and support.
UPDATE October 20, 2009: Today I called HP and they told me that they will NOT honor the warranty directly, that I must contact Amazon so they can send the computer to HP, which is ridiculous.  So pretty much, if you buy this computer through Amazon, HP will NOT honor their warranty.

Title: Very, very satisfied
Content:
This is the best portable heater I've ever owned - and that says a lot when you are 66 years old.  I've had it over a month now and it runs very quietly for one with a fan (hardly noticable hum).  Puts out lots of heat quickly.  It's been down as low as 22 degrees the last few nights and it has kept my 30 foot camper trailer (which I use often) very comfortable.  It is much cheaper to heat with this than propane - and certainly more convenient.  You can pick this heater up while it is on high with your bare hands and won't get burned.  Because of its shape, it fits nicely into any corner and out of the way.

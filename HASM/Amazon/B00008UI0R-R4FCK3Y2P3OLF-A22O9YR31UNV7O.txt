Title: just about perfect if it lasts
Content:
After reading some scary negative reviews and many positive ones I finally took the plunge and went for this. It came out to be a fine vacuum. So far it has lived up to my high expectations. The product and its finishing looks flimsy and cheap but it worked just fine. If this lasts for some good time I would say it's just one perfect home cleaning vacuum. The dust cup is too small - is my biggest complaint so far. It gets filled quite fast (depending on how frequently you use this to clean your house:) )

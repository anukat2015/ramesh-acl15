Title: Canon XTi 10.1MP review
Content:
Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black):  Digital has finally become useful!  This camera exactly as noted above has been everything I have been waiting for.  No delay that I can tell, multiple shots just by holding down the button.  User friendly selections and the ability to go totally manual in all aspects.  With just this set up I took a pic which showed the detail down to the hairs on a spider's legs, outdoors at 2am, flash from camera and a porchlight.

Title: Don't  Waste Your Money!
Content:
This is the most horrible vacuum I have ever owned!  Should have spent more on a product as this one actually creates more work.  Filter clogs very very easily and this vaccum blows dust, hair etc all over the place - basically picks up the dust/hair and shoots it off into a different direction.  With the slightest turn, it does this.  When I'm "done" vacuuming, the mess is much worse than not even vacuuming at all!  Also, although there is a setting for it, it does NOT work on anything but carpeting - and actually doesn't work well for that either.  Believe me, you do not want to waste your money on this item. I regret ever purchasing this and will turn to a different brand next time.

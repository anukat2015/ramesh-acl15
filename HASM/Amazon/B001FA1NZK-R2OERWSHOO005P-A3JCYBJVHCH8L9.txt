Title: iTouch
Content:
Haven't set up yet but hope to soon.  Loved my Classic iPod but lost it in a fire and am replacing with the iTouch... the thing that sucks is that you lose all your downloaded CD's and all the music you purchased thru iTunes because it's linked to only that particular iPod and it's serial number and the laptop you used.... all of which I lost in the fire.  Apple needs to come up with a way to be able to give you back what is yours in cases such as this, IMO.

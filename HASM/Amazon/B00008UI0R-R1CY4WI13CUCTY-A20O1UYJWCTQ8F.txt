Title: Great light weight vacuum
Content:
I've had this vacuum for about a month and I only have good things to say about it. It works much better than the more expensive and heavier vacuums I've owned through the years. It is even better than the Oreck xl upright I used to own. Suction is great and I like the fact that I no longer need to buy bags- a little cost that adds up. I hope it continues to do a good job in the months (and years?) ahead.

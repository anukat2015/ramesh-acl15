Title: fantastic
Content:
I love this computer.It is so lite to walk around with.It is so fast with windows 7 and I do not have to recharge for 8 to 10 hours. I would like to get touch screen on it. I am told I would need some drivers. I am still working on that. I think this is a great computer, even the keyboard is large for the 11.6 size. Buy it!

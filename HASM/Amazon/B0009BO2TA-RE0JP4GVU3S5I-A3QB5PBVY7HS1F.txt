Title: Only Okay
Content:
I bought it for it's neat look and portability and the fact that is is Hoover.  But the telescopic wand and floor attachment kept falling apart.  Not just that, but the hose connection point to the wand also wouldn't stay put.  I ended up taping the parts together, and that improved the connecting pieces.  The power is fine.  I have hardwood floors and rugs and its suction power is something I cannot complain about.

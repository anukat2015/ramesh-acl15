Title: Big Mistake
Content:
I bought a XPS M1530 with Vista OS last April. Big mistake.  Reasons:
1) 8 months after purchase a file in my user account was corrupted and my user settings were wiped out. My data was still in there, but sorting things out was not easy.
2) Development was a pain in the butt because if I didn't have a network connection, the system would not connect to my on-board web application server. Surprise!
3) User account control was kludgy with file access permissions. OK this is Vista...but not my problem Dell.
4) Vista. Enough said. Had to buy it for a job. Way to go Bill!
5) Hard drive is constantly checking itself for consistency. Errors in the hard drive bitmap. Probably because its a crappy hard drive.
6) Left part of case is separating from hinge...probably because of crappy workmanship.
Even with Windows 7, XP or Linux I wouldn't buy another box like this...it's an all around piece of junk. Not what I'd expect for an XPS system.

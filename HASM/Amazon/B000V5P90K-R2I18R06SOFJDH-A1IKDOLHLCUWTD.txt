Title: Love the Canon 40D
Content:
Upgrading from the Canon Rebel Xti has been the smartest move ever. The Xti was my first dslr and only had it for 7 months then sold it so I could up grade. At the time I was trying to chose between the 40D and the 5D. So glad I got the 40D because it just blows me away. I like the fast shutter speed specially in sports mode. My daughter plays soccer and keeping up with her is a must! Still learning all there is about this camera each day I am learning something new. At first I was uncertain about the Live View feature but it has come in handy for when I do still life shots. Still trying to figure out the auto focus in this mode. 
The EF 28-135mm F/3.5-5.6 IS USM Lens really help make this camera. I was so happy when I found out that it came with it instead of the standard kit lens canon puts on their cameras. Don't really like the macro feature of the lens but I like how I am able to get close to a person while taking pictures. This lens is great for weddings and portraiture photography. I also purchased the 50 f/1.8 II lens. With the 50mm and the 40D together wow does it take amazing shots!!
If you are stuck between a Rebel and the 40D or even the 5D you don't need to go any further. THIS is the camera to get and you wont be sorry at all. Yes the 5D is a full frame camera and is 2 mega pixels more but that's basically it! You can't get any better then the 40D and the price!

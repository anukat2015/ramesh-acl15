Title: Great little inexpensive heater!
Content:
After reading the previous review I was curious about this heater. I pulled it out of the box and plugged it in.
I couldn't tell it was doing anything. I turned the control knob and I could hear an audible click, and the fan came on blowing heat out the front. I have the heater set on low or 750 watts.
I have an infared temperature gauge so I pointed it at the front of the heater.
I was reading 130 to 140 degrees coming out at low.
I turned the control to full on high and moved the power switch to high which is 1500 watts and after a moment took another measurement. Temperature was 180 to 200 degrees.
Fan force is not real high but still it blows out heat and I could feel it at about 15 inches away from the grill area. High fan force tends to cool down the heater so thats probably why its set at this speed.
Ive left it running for an hour with no noticeable change in performance.
I suspect the other reviewer simply had a defect that should have been exchanged. I believe that all companies who partner with Amazon will replace any defect units of any kind.

Title: BEST CAMERA
Content:
The good: Excellent photo quality and performance for its class; comfortable, streamlined design; interchangeable lenses. 
The bad: EVF costs extra; can't use EVF and hot-shoe flash simultaneously. 
The bottom line: The best interchangeable-lens compact we've see thus far, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 delivers great photo quality and performance in an enthusiast-friendly shooting experience. Like competitors, however, the lack of an optical viewfinder limits its usability for photographing action.

Title: Good heat but a little sensitive
Content:
I already had a space heater I bought from Walmart before this one came in the mail, and when I plugged in the LASKO I was amazed by how quiet it was.  We had the power go out a couple of nights later due to a storm and the LASKO would turn on but stopped producing heat, so I sent it back and amazon sent me a new one within the week.  I love this space heater for how much heat it puts out, I always have it set to the highest setting and find myself turning it off because my apartment gets too hot.  It does make strange noises periodically (not sure why) but the noises always go away after a little while.

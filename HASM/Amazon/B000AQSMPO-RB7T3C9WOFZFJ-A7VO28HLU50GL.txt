Title: Best purchase Ive made in the past 6 months
Content:
I love this product. Well worth the money. The start up time in the morning is less than 4 minutes, I wake up hit the button, and the screen already says READY TO BREW by the time i'm out of the bathroom. the coffee is terrific with the k-cups. I bought the reusable filter (sold seperately) but its not nearly as good as the K cups (its real watered down, not as strong and potent as the K-cups are). and it looks next-gen! I would suggest this for anyone who lives alone, or in the morning just wants one cup and you dont feel like making a whole pot that will go to waste.

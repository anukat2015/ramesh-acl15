Title: A great tablet PC after free Windows 7 upgrade
Content:
I purchased this laptop in October from HP's website.  It came with a lot of bloatware, which really slowed it down.  After removing many of the third party applications pre-installed on the laptop it was much more responsive.  When I bought the laptop, it qualified for a free upgrade to windows 7 and after installing Windows 7 it was like a whole new computer.  It boots up faster and seems more responsive than with windows vista.  
In contrast to LawnMower Man's experience, my power supply is silent, the touchscreen responds well to my finger and stylus, and the laptop seems very sturdily built. The viewing angle of the screen could be better, but if the screen is facing you, you shouldn't have any problems.
I didn't think I would find much of a difference between my old notebook and a tablet notebook, but it has completely changed how I browse the internet, read .pdfs, and take notes.  The handwriting recognition software is pretty good out of the box, but you can train it to better recognise your handwriting so you can convert your hand written notes to text with few errors.  
I rarely ever use the touchpad mouse on the laptop.  When using the tablet like a regular notebook, its much more convenient to move windows and highlight text directly on the screen than it ever was to manipulate a touchpad mouse.  
I've really enjoyed using this tablet so far.  The touchscreen is responsive and accurate, and it was much cheaper than other tablet PCs on the market (e.g. lenovo).

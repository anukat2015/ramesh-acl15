Title: Great Overall Vacuum!
Content:
My house has all hardwood floors, and area rugs. It is VERY difficult to find a vacuum that can do both of these items very well.  Before this vac, I was using a canister vac for the hardwood (It did that job well, and did not have the beater bar...), and an upright DirtDevil for the carpets (No more DirtDevils). This vacuum handles hardwoods with ease, flip one quick switch to turn off the beater bar, and flip it back once you hit a rug! The floor height adjustments are very useful, and the light is great. The base has good coverage, and when locked upright, the beater bar stops. The suction is great, as I have two pets, and need to remove lots of hair from the rugs. The canister is easy to clean, and comes completely apart for thorough cleaning. The pet attachment is great for removing fur from furniture, or cleaning drapes/curtains. The canister removes easily, however, is a little unsteady when standing upright. The hose can extend, however, when you pull it, the canister falls over. This is the only reason this vac gets anything less than a 5. The canister is great for stairs, and easily transportable. Great price for the power. After 4 vacs...I found my favorite!

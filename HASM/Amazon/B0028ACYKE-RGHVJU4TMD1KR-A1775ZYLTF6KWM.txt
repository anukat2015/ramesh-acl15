Title: Good lightweight computer
Content:
I have an Acer 10-inch netbook (which I have been fairly happy with) and wanted to upgrade to a larger display, keypad and a bit more capability. The display on this little machine is fantastic, it's lightweight and the keypad is very usable. It operates quietly, doesn't get too hot, and provides great run time for a long session of surfing, youtube and TV viewing, and facebook and email interaction. It also works fairly well for typical word processing and spreadsheet use. If you compare the X340 to the performance of a 15-inch, dual core laptop you may be disappointed. However, if you want a very lightweight, portable machine for general home use and personal travel, this one hits the target.

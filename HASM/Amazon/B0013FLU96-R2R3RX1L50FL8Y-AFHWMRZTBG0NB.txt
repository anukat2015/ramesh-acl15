Title: Once you go Mac, you will never go back :)
Content:
Macs are an awesome product.  They just simply work and you are not plagued with Blue Screens of Death, computer freezing, vague computer errors and the need to reboot all the time.  Yes Macs cost more, but they do because they work and they are worth every single penny.  I will NEVER go back to PC (Piece of Crap)!  :)

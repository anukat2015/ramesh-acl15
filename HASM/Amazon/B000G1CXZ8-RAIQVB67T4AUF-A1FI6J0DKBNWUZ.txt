Title: Great product for the price
Content:
I purchased two of these for Christmas and absolutley love them.  They were inexpensive and I had no previous expectations for them other than they would warm a room and would be relatively quiet.  I like the remote control, the settings are simple, the unit is easy to use.  I feel the heater is quiet, we use it all the time in our finished basement where we entertain often, the running of the heater has never interfered with conversations or anything that is going on.  I even sit down there to read books and do not feel disturbed.  I am 100% satisfied with these units.

Title: Good for vacuum for less fluffy carpets
Content:
I bought this vaccuum to replace my Dirt Devil upright since it keeps breaking the belt for the brush. I live on a apartment and yes we have carpet flooring, but the carpet are the ones used in all bussiness office (not too fluffy). This vacuum works very well with that type of carpet picking up from hair to rice and cereals on the rug. I did try this with my sisters fluffier carpeting in their house and yes it sucks the carpets to point it stays in place and is hard to push around with it. Suction is excellent and the price is very cheap than the conventional uright. One advantage I like about this vacuum is that it can reach under the sofa way deeper than my upright, that includes the dining table and chairs as well. Its even way excelent on hardwood floors. Ill definitely buy another one. Also. no more buying belts for the brush, this has no brush which is why it save me money, I always replace the belts on my upright every 3 or 4 months, somehow its always breaking for me.

Title: amazing little toy
Content:
After owning the iPod Mini for over a year, my music library had far exceeded the memory limit and this beautiful little toy seemed like a reasonable upgrade. After enduring an anxious week of waiting, I finally received the G5 iPod yesterday and have had no problems whatsoever. The design is beautiful and practical. I plugged it in to my Powerbook and after pressing a button or two, my entire library of 1,700 songs was synced within 20 minutes. The screen is very nice; a tremendous upgrade from the previous generations. However, I am not fully satisfied with the resolution, as anyone (or rather, everyone) who is used to the high resolution offered in most television sets or computer monitors will notice a small, but definite difference in resolution quality. This isn't too bothersome, and I have found watching music videos and even full length movies to be very enjoyable. That being said, this iPod is a portable music player with 14 hours of battery life and simply offers the option of video playback. It would be wonderful if Apple found a way to extend the battery life to more than 2 hours on video playback, but that is unforunately not so and should not detract from the other quality features of the machine. It is commendable that Apple managed to retain the same retail price as the previous models while incoporating so many upgrades.

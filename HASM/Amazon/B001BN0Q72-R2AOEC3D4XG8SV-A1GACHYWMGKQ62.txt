Title: A good, compact notebook with solid performance
Content:
I bought the Sony VAIO VGN-SR140E/B 13.3 inch notebook after 4 years with my old Acer laptop. The Acer was bulky and ran pretty hot, so this time I decided to get myself something more compact, since I want to be able to comfortably hold it on my lap. I have to say that I'm very pleased with this notebook.
This VAIO is very small and light. It weighs something like 4 lbs. Besides being compact and light, I also like the fact that it doesn't run hot. It stays cool pretty much all the time. The fans are very quiet and barely noticable, even when they spool up (which happens once every two days, if that). The design  of the notebook is very nice. I wish it had more USB slots, but there's always some trade offs with a compact notebook. The biggest drawback is that the screen is on the small size. If you have bad vision you'll have a hard time with the screen resolution. Unfortunately the screen resolution can only be adjusted in such a way that it looks like absolute crap if it's anything other than the native resolution. I'm not a computer wiz, so I don't know how else to explain it. Personally, the 13.3 inch screen works out fine for me.
Other than that, it runs Vista without any problems. I haven't experienced any slowdowns so far. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase. For those looking to buy one of the 13.3 inch VAIOs, make sure that you are Ok with the screen size, because it may be a little too small for some people.

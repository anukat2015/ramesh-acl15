Title: Like my Krups!
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker 4 months ago & have had absolutely no problems so far.  It was a little tricky learning to program it, but I generally make my coffee fresh in the morning so I don't use the auto-program feature very much.  I do like that it has auto shut-off in case you forget to turn it off.  The only problem I have is that it is hard to keep the coffee from dribbling on the counter when pouring from the carafe.  Also, this product is white which requires a lot of cleaning.  I use bottle spring water to make my coffee so I do not have any hard water residue problems.
I will probably buy another Krups when this one wears out.

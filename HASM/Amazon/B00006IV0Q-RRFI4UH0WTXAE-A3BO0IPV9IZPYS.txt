Title: No more Farberware
Content:
We had always used Farberware Percolators and early on had very good luck. The 1st was a gift that lasted almost 20 years. Subsequently we went through 2 in 5 years. The Presto makes good strong hot coffee and so far seems to be well made. Hit me back in 2 years and see if it's still going.

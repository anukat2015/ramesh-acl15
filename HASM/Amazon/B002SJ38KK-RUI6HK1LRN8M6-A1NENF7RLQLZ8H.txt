Title: Unacceptable Service Support
Content:
My computer screen was defective right out of the box, full of flicker and black lines. After two days of dealing with Acer customer support, I only get the option of delivering the unit to a Fedex shipper and waitting 10 days for a repaired unit.  Considering that this is a brand new unit, I do not consider ending up with a repaired unit acceptable customer service.  Buyers should beware and shame on Acer!  I also complained to a supervisor but got no other alternative, "this is our warranty policy"  If you don't like it, return it to where you purchased it.  For this reason I do not recommend that you purchase Acer products.

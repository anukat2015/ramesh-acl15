Title: Another great Apple product
Content:
Personally I have no intentions of buying this device because I already have a 20GB iPod (which I have used flat out for the last 3 year with no problems) but I recieved the iPod Shuffle with a 15" PowerBook that I recently purchase.
What can I say about the iPod Shuffle but it's another quality product you would expect to get from Apple. It's small, compact, like all Apple products it's easy to set up, the battery life for the shuffle is exceptional and the sound quality is outstanding from such a minimal product.
I think this iPod works so well because of its minimalism, it has the most basic of controls, basic set up (just plug and play) and like the others in the iPod family it intergrates with iTune so well and easily. If you want a cheap and decent quality mp3 player this is definantly the one to get.

Title: Bunn Coffee Maker
Content:
We've used a Bunn Coffee Maker for at least 20 years and loved it. The new Bunn we've received has a four inch crack underneath the water reservoir (the ground coffee filter holder is below the reservoir). We didn't see the crack until recently (obviously we don't look under the reservoir very often).
Ground commercial coffee, over the last several years, have gotten finer and finer. Our favorite coffee has been Yuban and it not only has gotten finer, Yuban no longer makes decaf for large cans. It's not the Bunns problem that periodically the coffee overflows due to the coagulation of the "fine" coffee slowing the dripping therefore raising the water in the filter. This especially happens with our next best coffee, Folgers decaf. The Bunn overflows due to the fine coffee. It doesn't overflow when we add regular Yuban ground coffee to the Folgers ground decaf.

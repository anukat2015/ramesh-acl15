Title: My best purchase
Content:
I purchased this air conditioner (WA-1220M) three years ago and I can honestly say that it is the best purchase that I have made. The unit does wonders year-round. 
I live in an apartment in northern MN, less than a mile from Lake Superior. The summer temperatures do not typically exceed the mid-80's to low 90's, but when you add high humidity, it feels much hotter than the actual temperature. This unit does an AWESOME job at dehumidifying and it also cools my place to a comfortable temperature. It also has fan settings that I use year-round. 
Unlike a previous rater, I have no problems with the window seal (I even have extra length of the "foam" that they include). 
The drain for the dehumidifier does use a flexible plastic tube and, while it may not be *ideal*, I find that it works well. (I elevate my unit a couple of inches and have it continuously drain into a large basin that I can then empty).
Although this unit is technically a portable unit, it is rather heavy. This is not a problem for me because I do not have to carry it up/down stairs on a regular basis - the wheels help me move it from one location to another if I choose to switch things up, but I typically just keep it in my bedroom and find that it works well.
BOTTOM LINE: This product exceeded my expectations. Not only does it cool my apartment, it also dehumidifies amazingly!! It also has a fan that can be used year-round and an air filter that helps clean the air in my apartment.

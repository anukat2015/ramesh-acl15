Title: Love this coffee maker
Content:
This is my 2nd or 3rd brewmaster and I love the fact there is no pot to break.  This model is actually better than the previous one I had because the space where you put your cup or mug is higher so now a travel mug fits under it as well.  I use to have to pull my other one out to the end of the counter to do that before!  Thanks for the redesign!!  Would definitely buy again!

Title: Should have read Reviews first!
Content:
I bought this at a local store. I spilled coffee evertyime I tried to use it. Then I read the reviews here to see that it was poorly designed, leading to spills. If only the spout was a half inch forward, the coffee just might clear the brim and go in the coffee cup.

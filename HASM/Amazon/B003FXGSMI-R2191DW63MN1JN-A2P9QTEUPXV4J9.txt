So you are wondering if this if the right computer for you? Well I can not tell you if it is but out of all the possible options this is a well equipped, well rounded, and lastly long lasting battery life for such a low price. When searching for a computer I spent hours on the web scouring Amazon and other sites for the right computer that I could afford with a small budget (I am a college student who has extremely shallow pockets). You will see several versions of the ThinkPad T60 on Amazon, I think this is the best choice out of all them because it is a 14" and has a 9-cell Battery which makes it have considerably more battery life (the 15" has a shorter battery life and I do not know about you but large laptops are not convenient). Yes some other versions might have higher specs but not by much and it does not matter how much horsepower you have if that horse can all trot a few feet before being tired. You can google [...] and go to their site to look up the T60 to get detailed in depth overlook of the computer.
So just a brief list of positives about the T-60 is the keyboard (the keys feel individual and separate so it makes typing easier), it has a very spiffy appearance, well equipped with features like optical drive (Dvd player), and lastly good screen.
Before I close this review I would like to mention it being refurbished. I have never bought anything refurbished and I was really worried is it worth? I have to say yes all the way. You can not lose, because if somehow you get a crummy one then you can send it back with no repercussions. However I highly doubt you will get a crummy one, the one that I received looked brand new, I was blown away how nice it was.

Title: BUYER BEWARE!!!
Content:
I bought this computer about a year and a half ago. It worked great at first. After a few months of basic use, it began running LOUDER and slower. The mouse touch pad doesn't work properly and when I type, some letters don't register. I have to keep backing up and retyping words. The battery died after 13 months. I have used many utility programs to try and resolve some of these issues but to no avail.

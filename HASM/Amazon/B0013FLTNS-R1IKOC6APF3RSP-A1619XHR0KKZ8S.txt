Title: Thrilled with MBP
Content:
Been a Mac user since a Plus, and do professional audio and photography on Macs, and I practically couldn't be happier with the MBP.   Although I'd been keeping track of a few manufacturing issues on previous models, mostly display and case problems, nothing of the sort has shown up on mine.   Love the matte screen.  Aperture runs fine on it.    Everything just works.  I have some quibbles with Leopard and a few goofy Apple things, but that's a different story.   This has handled everything I've thrown at it.   One slight negative would be that it seems to be unable to bus power some devices that I previously hadn't needed to use power supplies with.
Great graphics card (no games for me), great display, great feeling box.   The low end MBP is a good deal.   Worth bumping up to if you're on the fence re: MB/MBP.   Extra RAM and a faster 7200 drive and you're in heaven.

Title: Keeps the Coffee HOT
Content:
My biggest concern purchasing a Thermal Carafe was it brewing the coffee hot and keeping it hot for several hours.  After reading the reviews I decided on this one and have not been disappointed.  Hot right after brewing and at least up to 3 hours later (I'd attest to longer, but we've finished coffee in a 2-3 hour window). If there is ever left over after our morning routine and I dump it in the evening (10 hours later) I have noticed it's still warm.  If I had it to do over again, I'd probably get the 10 cup vs. 12 cup.  Noise level on brewing is normal in my opinion... it's a nice sound in the morning to me.

Title: this vacuum actually works
Content:
It has been about 3 or 4 months using this vacuum and it is really great. I love the canister. I have mostly carpeting, yeck, and the canister vac actually picks up a lot of the dist and dirt, even though some say canisters are better for hard surfaces. The only this is emptying the canister.It is quite messy and when the filter gets gunked up with dirt it is a pain to clean it out. It is nice, though, that you can wash the filter and reuse.
All in all I am really satisfied with this vacuum.

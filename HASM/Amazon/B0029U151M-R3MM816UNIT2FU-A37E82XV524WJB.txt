Title: A great laptop
Content:
I've used this laptop for about 2 days now. I've waited for it since they announced the release back in April, the main reason I bought it was because of its size and price. You won't find another laptop with similar functionality and performance for its price. 
There are couple of things I want to critique:
- size of the keyboard, Dell's labtop keyboard are better and the wrist rest area is a little small. 
- The screen cannot fold all the way flat, which I think it's kinda silly
But if you're like me who's just a simple user who use the laptop to surf the internet and don't play a lot of games or do anything heavy duty this laptop has plenty of horse power!

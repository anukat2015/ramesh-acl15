Title: Good for hard surfaces- but not carpets
Content:
I looked for 6 months for a light weight, powerful canister vacuum that didn't loose suction or have a bag to change and I was really happy when I found this Dyson canister vac.  I've had it for about a month now, and I'm still happy with it - for the most part.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who has mostly hard surface floors, such as tile or hardwoods.  The turbinehead technology makes for a very light weight vacuum, and it works fine on area rugs, but it fails on wall-to-wall carpet.  Sometimes the turbine head stops spinning (if there carpet threads are long, such as the bathroom rug), but at the very least I feel that it fails to beat out the dirt from the carpeted bedrooms.  Its fantastic in our tiled living/dining room and kitchen though, and for that I really like it.

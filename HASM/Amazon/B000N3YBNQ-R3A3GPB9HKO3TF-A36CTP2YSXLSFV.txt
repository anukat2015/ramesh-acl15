Title: Works well! Tight little machine.
Content:
You will be shocked at the amout of bags you fill the first couple of times using this vacuum as it picks up so much more dirt.
This is not a mini vacume.  Motor is larger them most with more suction then most.  Weight is about the same or higher then full sized vacuums, but stores in less them 1/3 the space.
Gets more dirt and has more suction than my Eurka by at leaset 5x.  Filled a bag quickly the first time and it was not carpet lint.  Bags are small and about 1/2 the price then full sized bags.  Design means dirt goes almost directly to bag with little to clog.  So easy to get out and use tend to use more often.  Cord winder is strong.  Is a bit of a work out getting around corners and stuff.  Not a lazy womans vacuum nor for those with limited strength.  Noise level the same as full size machines.  Even though heavy as a regular vacuum easier to carry due to the design.
Height adjustable handle makes this great for kids.  My kids(8 & 12) will vacuum daily due to the ease of getting this out.  No hoses to connect, no tools to attach, no cord to wind if anything the ease of use makes it a 5 star item.

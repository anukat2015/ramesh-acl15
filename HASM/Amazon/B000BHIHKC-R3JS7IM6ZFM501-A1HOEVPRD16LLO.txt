Title: Like the new features
Content:
We wore out our first Home Cafe after years of daily usage and needed to replace it. We were very pleased on the new features of the GT300. We looked at other types, but Black and Decker allows us to fill our travel mugs easily. A few of the features we are happy about are how the door closes over the pod, the new buttons to choice cup size and that it beeps when done and also the removal tray for easy cleaning.

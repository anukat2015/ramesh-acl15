Title: Amazing Camera
Content:
This camera is simply amazing.  I am not a professional photographer - but I wanted to get better pictures than a point and shoot digital camera.  What can I say? This thing is an easy camera to use with a ton of features.  
Coming from a point/shoot world -- this camera was easy to use right out of the box on auto mode.  I don't have the steadiest of hands but I could take very nice pictures with this, even in low light.  Blacks looked black (without grain in the picture, like many cameras produce in low light).  The default pic size is huge (5K x 3K or something like that).  I used a 32GB SDHC which rates at about 3979 pics at this size.
Rapid shot was a nice feature.  The built in screen is large and very clear.  Looks like it may actually be HD resolution.  
Video capture was decent.  It is full 1080, and even though it can do 30p, I think 24p is better.  Like many video cameras, the video capture is not so good in lower light (where flash would be used for a still).
Remember I am not an expert photographer so I cannot comment on advanced features.  For the average/novice user, the modes work really well.  The camera is easy to use and produces stellar pictures.  Some people have complained of the camera's bulk, but I nor my wife have any complaints at all about its size/weight.  It is really easy to hold and handle.
In short both my wife and I are very excited about this camera and am very glad we got it.

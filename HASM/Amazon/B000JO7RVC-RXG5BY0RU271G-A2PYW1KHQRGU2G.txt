Title: Applaude Apple...
Content:
This isn't going to be a report on the ipod. I did lots of research on what my next mp3 was going to be. I orginally had a creative player, 20GB, and it was great. Then, the screen got dusty...anywho, I spent maybe three or four months making sure that I found a product that I would like. I'm pretty sure that I read almost all of the ipod reviews and there are things that I agree on, and things that I don't. I read many complaints about the new cover flow feature. The people that are complaining are just to fast in their approach. In my experience, and its that only, if you just wait for all the albums to load on the screen, it will be fine its something that you get used to, and you never remember it again. I have had no problems with the click wheel, and nothing wrong with the menus. ONE of the main reasons I bought an ipod was because of the time and trouble it took for me to get songs onto my old player. (I thought that by having a different player would make it cooler). WRONG. The software was so hard to navigate, getting songs on was a hassle, and the player constantly froze. Ugh. Apple, on the other hand, has perfected its *essentially* drag and drop music, and I can not believe that I thought this was not as cool. It is so easy, and so simple. The only problem that I have had with the ipod is that I had imported to many CDs. Yes, this an operator error, but I'm sending out a warning to anyone who buys this product: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH ROOM ON YOUR COMPUTER!!! I had to transfer all my music to an external hard drive, and change where the songs would be stored, holy crap. The iPod Classic 80GB is a product that I would recommend to anyone, especially to you.

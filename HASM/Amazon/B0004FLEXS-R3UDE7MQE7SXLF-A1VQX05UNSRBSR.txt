Title: Great coffee maker.
Content:
The B&D DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffeemaker makes a great cup of coffee.  Clean, crisp and fast.  It's easy to load up the ground coffee and water.  I really like that it shuts off in 2 hours... Putting the carafe under the drip takes a couple of tries but, once you get used to the tight fit under the basket, it's easy enough to put the carafe back.  The only downside is that the access to the basket and water tank is an all-in-one lid... You have to pull it out from under the cabinet to put ground coffee and water in.  All in all, a great coffeemaker for the price.

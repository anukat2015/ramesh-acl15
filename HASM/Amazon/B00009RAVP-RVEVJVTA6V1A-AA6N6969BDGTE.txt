Title: Our Favorite Heater
Content:
Our heater broke last year and we didn't want to spend a fortune to fix it.  We purchased a few space heaters to use while we were at home and this one turned out to be the best.  It doesn't get hot to the touch so we didn't have to worry about our dogs running into it. It can heat up a room pretty quick.  The only negative that I can say about it is it is too bright.  It's like being in the room with the sun.  Don't try to sleep with it on.

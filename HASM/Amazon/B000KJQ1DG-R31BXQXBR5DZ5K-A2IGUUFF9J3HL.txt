Title: Love it!
Content:
I have considered purchasing a DLSR for a couple of years, but it wasn't until my good ol' Sony point-and-shoot with awesome zoom started slowing down that I decided to go for it.
I LOVE this camera.  I decided on it after talking with a couple of photographer friends and playing with some competing products. The menus on this camera are very intuitive for me.  
I haven't had a chance to use all of the features yet, but the ones I have used are fantastic!
The included lens is an 18-55 mm, so the zoom doesn't even compare to my old digital...until I get another lens, I can live with it, though.

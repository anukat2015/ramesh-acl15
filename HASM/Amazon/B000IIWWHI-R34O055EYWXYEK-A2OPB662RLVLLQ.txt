Title: Replace every 18 months
Content:
I bought my first DCC-2000 in October 2006.  It slowly faded out, with the controls shutting off unpredictably, until one day, it was just dead.  I plugged it in and it wouldn't show the clock, nor would it turn on to brew the coffee.  I contacted Cuisinart, who replaced it for a $10.00 shipping fee.  I assume the replacement was refurbished.  It began doing the same thing at about 9 months to a year.  I coaxed about 5-6 more months out of it, but now it is sitting on my counter top DEAD.  I will contact Cuisinart again, to see if they will replace again.  However, I am not thrilled with having to replace this.  A coffee pot that costs as much as this one does should last 5-10 years, not 18 months.  When it works, it makes EXCELLENT coffee, and I love the feature of pushing the handle and getting hot, perfect, delicious coffee.  It even has a gauge (my hubby enjoys that).

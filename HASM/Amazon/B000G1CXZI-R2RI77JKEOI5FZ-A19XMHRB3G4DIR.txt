Title: Own 2 - for one and two years...very pleased by both
Content:
I purchased one of these two years ago then a 2nd unit last year. They are heavy little units but work exceptionally well for back-up heat or when you don't want to run the central unit. Whisper quiet, they are able to heat an average size room to the point of discomfort within a short period of time. Great price, solid construction, durable and quiet. Totally pleased by this purchase...just keep in mind, we are in the sunshine state so heat isn't as burdened as it would be up north.

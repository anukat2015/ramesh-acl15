Title: Picture Perfect Purchase
Content:
I've always loved taking pictures since I was a wee little girl.  Had many cameras through my life ranging from Kodak 110 Speed Film required to 35mm to key-chained digital and countless toy cameras from my early days.  Nothing compares to this camera.  I wanted a digital camera that would be more than just a "point and shoot".  A camera that allows me to set my own shutter and aperture settings to really get the shot I'm looking for.  My mom has this camera, and ever since she got this one and would let me borrow it (sometimes for days on end), I knew it was the one for me.  Easy to use, fun to learn, lightweight, wide range for depth of field shots, everything I was looking for.  It nails the shot to receive clear "forced blurred" shots, crystal clear panned shots, as well as capturing the back-lit rainbow glow of water droplets from a pouring out garden watering can.  I needed one for my digital photography class, and I'm glad I spent the extra money to get this one.  If you're looking for a solid digital camera, look no further than the Canon Digital SLR Rebel XSi...you will need a telephoto lens stretching out to space to find any disappoints with it.  And it ships very quickly, so you can catch that shutter bug in no time at all!  I am now camera ready and very satisfied.  Thank you :)
Now forever providing souvenirs to my memories,

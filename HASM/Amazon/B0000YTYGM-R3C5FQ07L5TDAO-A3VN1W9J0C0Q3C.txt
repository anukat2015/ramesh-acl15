Title: Good But Cannot See Time + other
Content:
Been thru a couple pots .. tried this and going to return it. 
Pro's" Hot coffe / thermal cafe great / good taste
Big con:  Time and brew time is NOT lit and very hard to see without a bright kitchen light .. only 53 yrs old .. need reading glasses to see time (not lit).  Also .. seeing am or pm hard to see and there is NO light to tell you you have set it on automatic perck ... bad design for sure.. 
good luck

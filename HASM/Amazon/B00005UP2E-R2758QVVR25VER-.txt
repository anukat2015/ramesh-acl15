Title: Dirt Disaster is more like it.....
Content:
I tried to like this vacuum cleaner after spending $..., but have grown to hate it.   It is impossible to clean.  The only way to get the filter clean is to vacuum it clean after each use---"tapping" it against the side of the garbage can does nothing but spew dust into the air--  since you are vacuuming the filter outside the vacuum all that dust and dirt clog up the tiny screen protecting the motor, which you then have to clean as well.  And you too wind up covered with a fine grey coat of dust.  The vacuum is made of cheesy plastic and though motor seems fairly powerful, it is not worth the time it takes to clean the vacuum cleaner (and yourself) after you are done cleaning the house.

Title: Almost a required upgrade
Content:
I bought this hose because I wanted to maximize the safety, usefulness and economy of the propane Portable Buddy heater by Mr Heater. You can't go wrong buying this hose! 
1. It allows the use of a larger LP tank (I have a 20 lb cylinder). I am certain the savings from buying LP fuel in bulk will pay for the hose.
2. You can locate the bulk tank a good distance away from the lit heater. I use the heater primarily in my garage, and with the hose I can put the heater up on a shelf or on the workbench, off the floor, and still have the bulk tank in a convenient and safe spot.
3. The hose can be used with any propane appliance that uses disposable propane cylinders.
Here's an essential safety tip when using this hose: be sure to shut/close the valve on the bulk tank BEFORE you remove the hose from the tank. It's possible to remove the hose end from the bulk tank without closing the tank valve and you will quickly find out that liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is another name for stinky, oily mess when it comes squirting out of the valve as I've done.

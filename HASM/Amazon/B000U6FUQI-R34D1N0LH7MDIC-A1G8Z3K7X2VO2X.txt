Title: Surprised It Works Well
Content:
I actually really love this vacuum. As another reviewer said, it does what it's mean. Used daily it works really well. I have long hair and it's always falling out so all over the floors. The thing I like about this vacum is that it picks up all my long hair and since it doesn't have a brush, the hair doesn't become tangled all in the brush. 
I've had it for a week and pleased. It was able to pick up crumbs in my kitchen. One thing I do notice is that I don;t think it was meant to go over a bunch of paper and pick every piece up. I tried using it when my shredder fell over and I needed to pick up lots of shredded paper. That didn't go so well until I picked up most of the paper by hand and used the vacuum for the rest. Very easy to handle. 
Cons - It could maybe use a bit more suction but I think that if it does, then the vacuum would be heavier which would make it harder to use. I love the fact that it's lightweight and I can go grab it w/o a big deal. Also tried it on stairs and again, my hair is always piling up and picked up hair and small dust bunnies easily.

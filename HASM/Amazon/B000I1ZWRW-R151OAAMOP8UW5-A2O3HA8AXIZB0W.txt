Title: WOW!
Content:
This is my first DSLR camera and I have to say I am absolutely delighted with it. I've got to the stage where normal consumer cameras just dont cut it anymore. Sure they have loads of megapixels but they never advertise how bad the quality is. They just keep bragging about how many pixels they shoe-horned into each shot.
So I decided the time was right to do something about it. The photo quality is superb, and there are many options to optimize the picture quality for a given scene. The build quality, feature set and support for the Digital Rebel XTi/EOS 400D are top notch, as well as the battery life. I took about 400 snaps so far (each around 3-5MB) and the battery is still on its first charge. This is everything I'd hoped it would be and more.
If your thinking of entering the world of DSLR cameras, get one of these. Seriously.

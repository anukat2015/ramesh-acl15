Title: Over 2 years and still going strong!
Content:
I bought this two years ago when my wife was pregnant and we were having record heat waves and we were without A?C.  It did the trick and two years later it still works like a champ.  Haven't had any of the issues others posted about.  This brings nice cool air into my room and shortly after I turn it on, about 20 min. the room is as cool as I want it. Good Luck!

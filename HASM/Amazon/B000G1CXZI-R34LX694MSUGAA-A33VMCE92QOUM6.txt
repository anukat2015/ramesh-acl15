Title: So far, great heaters!
Content:
We bought two of these units last year (2007) and used them 24/7 in our bathroom and bedroom to supplement our pellet stove. They worked great and we've already been using them this fall. We bought two of the TRN0812T's last month and so far they've worked flawlessly. We actually bought two more to give as presents a couple of weeks later. They are actually smaller than the units we bought last year. The older units had 10 fins, the new ones have 8 fins. The heat output seems the same.

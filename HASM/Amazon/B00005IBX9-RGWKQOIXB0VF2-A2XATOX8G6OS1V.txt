Title: Nice Coffee Maker
Content:
UPDATE:  One year later, I really like this coffeemaker.  Great coffee every time, effective timer.  Still don't like the display, though.  Great at this price.  I assume the Cuisinart updated replacements now on the market do just as well. Changed to 5 stars.
This is a nice enough appliance.  It makes excellent coffee very quickly. (We don't use fancy coffees; Market Day fundraisers provide a reasonable coffee, and we like Duncan Donuts brand, too).
The pot pours very nicely. Filling the reservoir is not that big a deal, but I can see that a shorter person would have trouble seeing into the tank. The whole unit is pretty heavy and very tall. You do have to pull it out from under the cabinets to fill it.
The programming is easy, but the screen is annoyingly difficult to see.   The black chrome is very pretty and requires less care than stainless steel. On sale, the machine is a better buy, making good, hot coffee every time. But at full price, I'd consider some other less pricey options.

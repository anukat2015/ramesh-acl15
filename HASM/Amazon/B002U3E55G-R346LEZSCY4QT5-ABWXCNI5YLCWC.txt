Title: SAVE YOUR $$$$$
Content:
I got this as a Christmas gift...it worked for 10 days!  THATS ALL!  Even working it was marginally warm on the high setting. I had NO idea that this thing cost so much,otherwise I would have talked to the person who gifted it to me.  I had already  tossed it out thinking it was like a $20.00 gift. Keep your money in your wallet!

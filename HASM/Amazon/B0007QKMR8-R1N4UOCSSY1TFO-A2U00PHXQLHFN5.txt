Title: Excellent Semi-Pro Digital Camera
Content:
The Canon Digital Rebel XT is a great camera.  I have been able to use all my Canon EF lenses, which was the main reason I purchased this jewel.  The shots are absolutely stunning.  It takes great shots in auto mode, but has the ability to let your creativity fly with manual and other program modes.  If you have legacy EF lenses and you want to maximize that investment, this camera is definitely the way to shoot digitally.

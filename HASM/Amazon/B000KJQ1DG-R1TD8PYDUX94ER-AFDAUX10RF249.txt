Title: Low Quality, Cheap Plastic, Great Pictures!
Content:
I finally broke down and decided to get a Digital SLR. I have used traditional SLR cameras for years and decided the digital point and shoot wasn't cutting it. After having the camera for less than a month the Zoom on the Nikkor lens broke. Amazon was kind enough to exchange the camera. A month later the camera strap broke and the camera fell 2 feet onto soft wet grass. The lens broke in the exact same manner. I had to take the lens apart and see what was up. I tiny piece of cheap plastic had broken off inside the lens and gotten into and broke the turning mechanism. Frustrating. At this point I picked up a third party lens. It was a bit slower but it did the trick and was built much better than the Nikkor lens. A few months later, the camera took another spill while in the bag. This time it was the flash that broke. It would open and continue to click and try to open itself. A quick google search showed this was a very common problem. I opened up the camera again to find the source of the problem and it was yet again a very cheap piece of plastic that had broken off. 
The camera does take great pictures though. Way better than a point and shoot. We have young children and it's been great to capture memories. I will most likely pick-up a third party flash to resolve the current issue. I will never buy Nikon again though. This is not a well built camera. If you have children consider something else.

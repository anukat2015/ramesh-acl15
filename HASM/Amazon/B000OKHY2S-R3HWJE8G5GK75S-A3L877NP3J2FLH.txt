Title: Shin bruiser
Content:
I live in the California Central Valley where evaporative coolers work very well in the low humidity. I purchased this to use in my motor home which I live in full-time and the square footage is less than this cooler is rated to cool. I read the instructions, filled it with water and turned it on. Air came out and it was as cool as the floor fan I normally use. Surely I thought the air will chill out in a few minutes. NOT! Ten minutes later I could barely (and I'm being generous here) feel ANY cooling at all. 
I then added ice cubes to the top compartment and that was a joke. So then I added ice cubes to the water tank and finally I felt a bit of cooler air. But I never had to add ice cubes to my evap. roof cooler in the house I used to own. That roof unit blew so much cool air into my home I never ever ran my compressor air conditioner that came with the house. And I sure as hell wasn't going to put ice cubes in a gadget which should work withOUT ice cubes. I'll bet I'd get cooler air if I sat in front of a bowl of ice cubes with air blowing my direction from my trusty old floor fan.
I know that the concept of running water over a filter and blowing air over it will cool room air significantly. The principal is so basic one has to wonder why this thing can't even do THAT right. 
I sold it a month later at a garage sale for $20. I couldn't in good conscious ask for more for that thing which is nothing but a shin banging floor fan.
Save your money.

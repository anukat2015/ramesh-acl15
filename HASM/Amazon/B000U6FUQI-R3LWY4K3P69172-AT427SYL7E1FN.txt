Title: Loses Suction after several times of use...even after fully recharging.
Content:
We have had this vacuum for about 7 months now.  At first, it was doing a fairly good job for what it was meant for.  We have hardwood floors on our entire first floor and this was bought for us for Christmas to replace a previous cordless stick vacuum whose battery quit holding a charge.  
For the first few months it was doing good picking up dirt, hair from 2 dogs, and whatever my 4 year old dropped along the way.
Now, working on my 7th month of owning it, it's hardly doing the job.  I empty the canister twice while vacuuming and make sure it's completely charged, but it's not sucking up the little tiny pieces of dirty and all of the hair anymore.
I'm going to have to cave and get something else now.

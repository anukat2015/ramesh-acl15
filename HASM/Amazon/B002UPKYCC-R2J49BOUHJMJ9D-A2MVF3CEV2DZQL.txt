Title: big, powerful, fast, loaded with features, but mucho heavy!!
Content:
We took the plunge and bought this for the family, despite HP's dismal service record.  So far so good.  It's big (REALLY big), fast and with a good feature set particularly for the money.  Windows 7 appears to be finally relatively debugged for a first release (much better than Vista in that regard).  Lots of OS eye candy, in terms of the Aero features.  If you're looking for a desktop replacement, that's mostly plugged in most of the time, and you need a lot of features and don't mind the weight, this looks like a good PC system for the money.
Pros:
1) fast and capable
2) rich feature set: high-definition screen (1920x1010), Blu-Ray, big 7200 RPM hard drive, full keyboard, several other bells and whistles
3) Windows 7 appears to be pretty reliable (so far!)
4) neat fingerprint reader (definitely a gimmick for some, but it makes switching between password-protected users a lot easier)
Cons:
1) we did say it was big (honking would be more like it)
2) poor battery life, at most about 1:45 (not sure why, given that we bought the larger battery which of course adds to the svelteness)
3) not portable (forget about traveling with this monster)
4) HP's legendary service (regarded as about as bad as it gets, just about as bad as Dell's)

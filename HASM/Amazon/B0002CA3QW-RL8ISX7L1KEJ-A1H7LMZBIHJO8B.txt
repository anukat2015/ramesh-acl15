Title: Convenient, but messy
Content:
Coffee quality is fine. The "go" cups can be very convenient.
However, the base of the machine, where the carafe sits, is very slick with no indentations to help you seat the carafe properly. If the carafe is even slightly out of place, coffee will go EVERYWHERE.  I've cleaned up after this thing more times than I can count.  
The top of the carafe is also poorly designed for pouring, and drips and spills a great deal.  I wouldn't buy this product again.

Title: Fast, stylish, a terrific little player
Content:
Perhaps this review comes a bit late, what with the new Nano commercials featuring Video capability.
This mp3 player is perfect. The flash hard drive means songs are played almost instantaneously, no hard drive lag that occurs with other players.
I highly recommend this iPod. Just make sure that if you buy it for your girlfriend who agrees to pay you that you get the money upfront before you break up.

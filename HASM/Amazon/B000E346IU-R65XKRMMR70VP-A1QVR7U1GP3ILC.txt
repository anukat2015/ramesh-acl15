Title: Started out well, but now ineffective
Content:
This heater worked well when it first arrived.  It heated my 8 x 15 office quickly.  It did have some unpleasant smell at first, as noted by others, but it didn't take long to dissipate.  However, it has progressively been much less effective in heating this room.  What I really don't like is the way the heat is dispersed.  The pics look like half of the front is a grill for the heat to come from.  This is not correct.  All of the heat comes out of the top, and the top of the BACK!  There is no way that this heater can be placed next to a wall, or even under anything.  Any object directly behind or above will be subjected to constant, intense heat whenever the heater is turned on.  I would definitely not recomment this product to anyone.

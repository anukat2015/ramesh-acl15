Title: Worst coffee pot I have ever owned
Content:
Buy this one only if your hobby is cleaning up coffee grounds and spills for about 30 minutes a day.  This morning, the front door popped open during the grind cycle and blew coffee grounds all over my white counter tops and floor.  This is a regular occurrence.  This also happened in spite of the duct tape wrapped around the machine to hold it closed.  Avoid this coffee maker...run for the exits...call in the experts for an exorcism.  (Need I say more?) I Have taped this Cuisinart to the top of my outside garbage can to serve as mute testimony of lousy workmanship and design.  The garbage man may not even take it!!!

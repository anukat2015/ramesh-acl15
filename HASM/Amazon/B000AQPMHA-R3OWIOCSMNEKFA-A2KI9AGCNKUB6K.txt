Title: I love this coffee maker
Content:
A friend of mine has this and I used it at her house and I had to buy one.  I love it.  I can make 4 different flavors of coffee for 4 different people.  It is fast, simple and I never waste half a pot of coffee like I used to.  I get a perfect cup every time.  
I wake up, turn it on, wash my face and brush my teeth, go to the Keurig and put my K-cup in, push the lid down  and press the blue button - 30 seconds later, yummy coffee
You get the strength you want, the flavor you want, the amount you want.
I got the one without the bells and whistles and it is perfect for me.  I am glad that this one has two sizes and the automatic shut off option...  I love the automatic shut off...

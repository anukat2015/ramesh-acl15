Title: wonderful camera - BUT.....
Content:
Just got my D300, and it is truly a wonderful camera.  With a tweaking of the settings (ie vivid) my photos are looking HOT!  Better than reality!  BUT, this morning I came outside and was shooting some purple flowers, that ended up looking blue onscreen.  I played around with the WB and reset the picture settings to normal and even nuetral, even set the auto white balance to a slightly different setting - in other words LOTS of tweaking...- and eventually more of the purple came out than  blue.  But, still not as satisfactory as I'd like.  So watch out for the colour purple.  This camera reads it as blue!  Any suggestions, please email me at ideasfromtravel@googlemail.com

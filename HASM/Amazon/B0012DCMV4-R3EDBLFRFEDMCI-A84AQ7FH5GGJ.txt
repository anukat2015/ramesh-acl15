Title: NOT AN ENERGY SAVER
Content:
I purchased a 1500 watt comfort zone infared heater to heat our office that seems to be colder than the rest of the house. When plugged in and turned on it draws so much energy you can see the lights dim and then after a little while the breaker will trip. Our house is only about 10 years old, so I know our wiring is ok. When i called the heater company to talk to them about my breaker tripping all the time, they informed me that this heater needs its own circuit, meaning I would have to run a seperate line and breaker for just this heater. Does this sound energy efficient? I don't think so, and not only is the heater not energy efficient but it is no longer a portable heater as advertised, unless you run a dedicated circuit in every room of your house that you might want to use this heater.

Title: Nice esspresso every time
Content:
Tried this out (Cadillac unit) in England.... this is the basic unit, but inside the same except it does not froth milk and do all the extra stuff...it is just for espresso (or coffee).... tastes as good as the larger more expensive ones.......I've only had it a few months though and it is making lots of noise sometimes while brewing and is at times can be a little slower than usual...... having said that, overall it is the best out there especially for people who hate the mess of the grounds and cleanup, etc....it is as they say...it taste the same every time as the pods are vac-packed and it is so quick and easy....truly "plug and play".

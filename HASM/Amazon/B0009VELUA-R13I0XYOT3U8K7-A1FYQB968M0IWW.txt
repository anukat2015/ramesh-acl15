Title: Best drip on the market
Content:
Awesome drip machine - better than about 6 others I've used in in the past.  I also currently have the Cuisinart model that grinds the beans right before brewing them.  This machine does a much better job!  The coffee maker is super easy to clean, dishwasher safe for cleaning (once a week), super easy to use, and makes some great coffee!  Built in warmer keeps the brew hot for many hours, just pours right into your coffee cup/mug.  We use ours daily, sometimes even twice a day.  Excellent quality overall.  Closest thing to using a french press, but less of a hassle.

Title: Rebel XTi
Content:
I really like the XTi, but I bought it about three months before the XSi came out.  I am not sure I would have made a different decision, but it's possible.  I am returning to photography as a hobby after 20 years and I think this is a very competent camera for my needs.  I only wish it had a "live view" screen.  The picture quality is exceptional.  Of course, you must have a good lens to take advantage of the capabilities.

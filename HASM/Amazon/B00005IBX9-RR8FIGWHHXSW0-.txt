Title: Best Coffeemaker Ever!
Content:
This is by far the best coffemaker on the market.  The 5 beep alert at the end of the drip cycle is pretty cool and better yet when you pour your coffee it's hot!!  No longer do we drink medium hot coffee.  What a treat.  It's easy to use, clean up is a breeze, has a quality 'feel' to it.  Filter is easy to change and easy to find.  The other bells and whistles make this the best coffeemaker we've ever had.  What more can I say?  This is our third coffemaker this year and I know it's our last.  Love at first cup!

Title: good laptop, lousy reseller
Content:
The laptop is quick and arrived in perfect shape. The only machine complaints I have are the bloatware that you have to uninstall (common on notebooks) and the keys seem to double strike fairly often when typing (compared to others, not a deal-breaker by any means) resulting in a star reduction. However, I deducted another star because of the reseller failing to note that the refurbished condition means that one does not qualify for the Asus Windows 7 free upgrade program and refusing to answer emails about said problem, not even to say it's your problem.  It's not so much that I didn't get the upgrade considering the great price, but one is left with a bad taste in your mouth with Amazon shoppers should be wary when dealing with J&R Music and Electronics.

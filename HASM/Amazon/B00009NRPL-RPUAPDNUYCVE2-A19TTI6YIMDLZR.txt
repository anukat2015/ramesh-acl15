Title: Waste of money
Content:
After this percolator stopped working, we were instructed to send it to Dulalit's service center for repair (Electra Craft, Inc.)  Customer service at the repair center was very unprofessional -- they would tell us the package was shipping out to us, and nothing would arrive.  It was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition.  It took them four months to return the percolator to us.  They refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund.  
We unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one, I had to contact Electra Craft, again.  They were able to provide the part, a simple stainless steel lid, for $25.00 plus shipping and handling!  I'm sure their other replacement parts are overpriced as well!

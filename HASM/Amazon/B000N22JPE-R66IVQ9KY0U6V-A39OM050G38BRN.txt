Title: Nice Looking; Makes Decent Coffee
Content:
I bought this product a couple of weeks ago.  I couldn't drink the coffee that first came from the unit as it had a pronounced "plastic" taste.  Following the cleaning directions on the unit and cleaning the unit out with vinegar really helped, but a slight flavor still lingered.  A second cleaning helped even more and the coffee is acceptable, yet I can still detect a slight "off" flavor my cheaper coffee maker never left behind.  It's not horrible by any means, but it is still detectable.  So, the unit is okay; but, I did expect a higher-quality coffee making experience given the price of the unit.

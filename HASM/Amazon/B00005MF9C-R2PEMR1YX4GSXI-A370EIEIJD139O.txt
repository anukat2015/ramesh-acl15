Title: Fantastica Price, Compact, Few Moving Parts, Simple. AWESOME Product.
Content:
Length:: 2:37 MinsThis product is AMAZING.  I'm glad I didnt' pay more than I did ($18.40) but I EASILY would've paid 3 times as much than I paid for it!  First off, I AM  TOUGH hard-to-satisfy-highly-demanding consumer-critic,what have you.  If you get a positive review from me, the product rocks, and this one does.  What I love about it:
--compactness -- so compact, neat tidy
--EXTREMELY simple operate -- ltierallly ONE button, can't even call it a button it's an auto shutoff lever so you don't even have to worry aobut ono/off placemnt it's just "press" and it works
--Few moving parts -- it has literally THREE parts (4 if you count the filter as two) the cup, the filter (and container), and the maker.  SO many otehr coffee makers have way too many parts. this one does not
--Makes GREAT strong coffee!
-- Again price.

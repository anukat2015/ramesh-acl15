Title: I brew in the sunlight and the temp is hotter
Content:
I lost one of these brewing too close to my Kiln when I was doing a firing of specialty ashtrays for a smoker's rights group. But I got hotter temps in the carafe without unit destruction when I put the entire device into a box window I have on the East side of the house. The windows converge and the added heat preheats the entire coffeemaker and I am getting temps that are several degrees hotter now in the carafe. I am using a piezoelectric reader with an extra long probe to put it down into the bottom of the carafe to get the true bottom temp. I think people may be putting their temp devices only on the top layer of the carafe and are getting artificially higher readings. Unfortunately the sun doesn't get over the fichus tree into the window box until ten in the morning and I initially got the machine for morning coffee to be ready around seven. I have adjusted my work schedule however and I am going to bed later and starting work at 10:15 and everything is stable at the moment...

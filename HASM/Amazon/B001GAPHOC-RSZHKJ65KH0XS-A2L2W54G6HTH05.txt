Title: Simple: the best deal in the market
Content:
I don't know where to begin when discussing the fine points of this camera. Wonderful feel. Versatile lens application. Tack sharp pictures. Intelligent, intuitive function. 1/2 the price of a comparable Nikon or Canon. Wish the flash rotated 90 degrees -- but hey, that's really nit-picking. Buy this camera with the $39.95 Dolica Proline tripod Dolica STC-100 63-Inch Tripod with 68-Inch Ball Head Tripod Kit -- trust me, you will be extremely happy.

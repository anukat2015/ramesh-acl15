Title: bagless vacuums - messy concept
Content:
I bought this vacuum 4 months ago and am very disappointed. Not only is the vacuum quite loud and suction lousy, but you have double the work to empty it. You need to clean up the mess after emptying the canister and need to clean it often. It does a poor job on the few rugs I have and now its in the shop to see if they can figure out why it doesn't suck. I would never buy this vacuum again and who knows how the warranty will work. Next vacuum will have a bag!

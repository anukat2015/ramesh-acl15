Title: No Better Than Other Space Heaters
Content:
I purchased the edenpure 1000 and found that the main difference between it and other space heaters is price.  I own several other space heaters including one 1500 watt unit with a fan and one 1500 watt oil filled radiator style heater.  I can't tell any real difference in the heating ability of any of them except one thing...price.  I purchased an oil filled radiant heater from Target for $28 which seems to do just as well as the edenpure which cost hundreds of dollars more.  Not a good value.

Title: Needs Attention
Content:
I wanted the largest programable coffee maker I could find that had a carafe to keep the coffee warm for a long time.  This one meets the requirements well.  I made a pot one night, left some in the carafe, and it was still warm the next morning.  However, his is rather poorly made.  The brew and serve feature dribbles.  You do have to pay attention to make sure you get the lid on right and get the filter closed correclty. Perhaps I got lazy with my previous coffee maker because it didn't require any concentration.  The parts all just fit.  This one just needs a second validation that you got it all right before you push the start button.

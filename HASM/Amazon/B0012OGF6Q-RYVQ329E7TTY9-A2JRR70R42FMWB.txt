Title: Great camera
Content:
There is really nothing to say about Nikon. Nikon is Nikon. The camera is great and makes incredible pictures. There is a lot to be learned about the camera and how to use it.
Update: A year later after I purchased this camera it still amazes me at the pictures it is taking and is about 100 dollars more than what I bought it for. This was a great deal then..

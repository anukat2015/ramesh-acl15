Title: Speed
Content:
I just thought I'd point out that this is a sports camera with an amazing buffer + continuous shooting mode.  Here are the specs:
* Continuous High [CH] - 8 fps
* Continuous Low [CL] -1 to 7 fps (programmable)
* Buffer size 50 JPEG frames, 40 NEF (RAW) frames * 
THIS is the only reason to buy this camera over the D1X or D70.  But if you're looking for a great studio camera, the D1X won't let you down, and if you're just getting into DSLR's, the D50/ D70 are great bodies to get started on.
Thanks for reading!

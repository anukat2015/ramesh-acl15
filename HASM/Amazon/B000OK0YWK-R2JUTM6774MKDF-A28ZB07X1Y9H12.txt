Title: Zune vs Ipod
Content:
There are two things I love about the Zune: #1 is the size of the screen. #2 is the radio which are 2 things that the ipod does not have. Sometimes when you are playing the raido it even tells you what song is playing and the artist which is great. 
The bad thing about this product is buying music online. It will not allow you to buy songs individually like itunes. You have to buy a $5 card and each song has different prices from 79 cents to 99 cents. So this means that after buying 4 songs you'll have a balance of 69 cents or so and won't have enought to buy a fifth song. Because the balance is so uneven, you'll always have something left on the card that you won't be able to use. Thats a rip-off. The other bad thing about the zune is that variety of music that you can buy online is not as extended as itunes. They have limited choices.  
I bought the zune for my husband but I am getting me an ipod. itunes allows me to buy as many songs I want for only 99 cents each with no additional fees.

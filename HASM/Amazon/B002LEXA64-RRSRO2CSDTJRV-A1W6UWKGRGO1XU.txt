Title: Nearly Perfect Combination of Portability and Capability
Content:
I wanted something that was ultra-portable, but had a better display, keyboard, and processor than the typical under-powered netbook. This machine hits that sweet spot. I walk about a mile to work, and have no problem carrying this laptop with me. It weighs only a little more than the most netbooks, but is much more capable. It runs demanding statistical software without a hitch. Also, with an external dvd drive it plays movies without any hiccups.

Title: Great mocha maker
Content:
It may be slightly awkward to clean, but you can make the best coffee drinks with this machine.  There are some really great recipes in the book you get with it.  It makes best hot apple cider.  As a matter of fact, I bought this machine just to make apple cider during the holidays and it performed perfectly.  I had perfectly heated cider all day long and it always tasted great.

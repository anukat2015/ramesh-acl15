Title: Awesome!
Content:
This coffeemaker is perfect for what it is designed for.  It makes 1 or 2 cups easily, very quickly.  You can leave the lids on while brewing or leave them off, which is a great feature, if you are making 2 cups and the second person sleeps later.  This way it doesn't get cold!
All in all, a great coffeemaker for the price!

Title: Perfect
Content:
This was my first DSLR and I bought it 6 months before first child was born.  I cannot take a bad picture with this thing.  Pair with the cheap SB-400 flash and you'll be taking professional pictures in any light with little effort.  The fact that people still drop several hundred dollars on the virtually "disposable" "cute colored" point and shoots when a camera like this is just a couple hundred more is beyond me.  Buy it, buy it now.

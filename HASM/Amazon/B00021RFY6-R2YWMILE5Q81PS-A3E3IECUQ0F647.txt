Title: Does not completely brew
Content:
I purchase this machine refurbished from another online company. Unfortunately my warranty was only for 90 days because 5 months later, it does not completely empty the water reservoir when I brew.  I have to press the start button several times in order to get the machine to empty it completely. I did a search on reveiws after the fact, and found that this is a VERY common problem and no way to fix it. Think twice before spending so much on this coffee maker.  I loved it when I first got it but now I am very frustrated. ALso, when you don't use the grinder, it fills with steam and you have to wipe it all off before the next time you use it. Too much work for one cup of coffe!

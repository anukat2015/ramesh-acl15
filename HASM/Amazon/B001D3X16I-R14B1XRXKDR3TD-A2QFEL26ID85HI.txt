Title: For audio book readers
Content:
I bought this specifically to listen to books.  I have three complaints.
1. The bookmark function allows a bookmark to be set but no way to go to that bookmark.  I've searched the web extensively and can find NO instruction on how to go to a bookmark.  Sometimes the player will resume where I left off, sometimes it won't. Infuriating.
2.  The fast forward/reverse has sometimes caused the book to go reset to the beginning.  Also infuriating.
3.  I haven't done as much how-to research, but I can't get the thing to play a whole music album or is this a playlist I want?  So far I can not get it to setup a playlist.

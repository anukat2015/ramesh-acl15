Title: Join the Big Boys with a Big Boy camera without the Big Boy price!
Content:
I'm an advanced amateur photographer (difference between me and a "professional" is that I don't derive 5% or more of my income from the pursuit of photography).  I've owned numerous Canon film cameras over the years.  Their reliability is second to none.  The Canon EOS 10s was years ahead of its time.  So much so that when Pop Photo first reviewed it, they essentially said that it was the most advanced 35mm SLR camera they'd ever reviewed to that point in time.  Buying the Rebel XIi many years later took no great leap of faith.  BUT, I first had to be convinced that the noise level (or the equivalent of the graininess in film) would be extremely low in those areas where it is most apt to rear its ugly head -- nighttime photography, photos with dark backgrounds, underexposed photos.  To make a long story short, I was astounded at the lack of noise.  I tried my darndest to make noise appear, and about the best I could do was equivalent to shooting today's high-quality ISO 800 speed film in moderate to ample light.  Match a low noise camera up with a fine optic and a photographer worth his or her salt, and you have an unbeatable combination that will befuddle a top notch photo editor with his or her trusty 10x loupe.

Title: So happy!
Content:
This is my first DSLR so I didn't want to spend a fortune but at the same time I didn't want something that would be a waste of money. I couldn't be happier with this camera. It's smaller than the Nikon and it's comfortable to handle & easy to use. 
My only recommendation is to not buy the 2 lens kit that includes the 50-200mm.... but to get the 300mm for a little extra. The 200 isn't enough and I really don't use it like I would if it had a little more zoom capability like a 300.

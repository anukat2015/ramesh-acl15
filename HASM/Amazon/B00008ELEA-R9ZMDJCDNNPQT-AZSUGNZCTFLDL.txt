Title: Best Tasting Coffee You Will Make at Home
Content:
Yes it's true there have been problems over the past few years with this percolator...for a while Sears had the design and so did Black and Decker it was never as good as it was when manufactured in New York.  And my last one died an untimely death after a short life of limping along, right from the box it wouldn't pour well without the lid being slightly open...put a thrill in pouring coffee without being scalded early in the morning.  There is nothing like stainless steel to brew coffee the way it should be brewed, I imagine all glass would be even better but I'm not sure it can be found in an automatic percolator version.  We had the older New York models that lasted decades at a clip then the only part to wear out was a plug and every two years or so it was off to the hardware store to get a short 6" appliance plug.  I've made up my mind to just keep sending it back under warrantee for the first year and since my credit card extends the warrantee I'm good for two years. I've thrown out my share of crappy Mr. Coffee makers (they sneak in as presents) and even the more expensive Mr. Coffee types have a plastic reservoir that imparts a plastic aftertaste to an otherwise good cup of coffee.
I think I'll stick with getting that better cup of coffee even if it's a bit of a struggle.

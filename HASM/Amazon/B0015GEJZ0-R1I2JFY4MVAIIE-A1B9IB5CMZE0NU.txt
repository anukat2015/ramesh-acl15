Title: K20D worth whatever you pay!
Content:
I have had digital cameras for years and have captured some great shots (usually in full sun and low ISO), my wife is a Pentax 35mm film buff (or should I say was). I bought this camera to test the waters of the SLR digital world and wanted to be able to keep costs down while using some existing lenses from my wifes lenses. 
What a camera for me to start off with, I have now purchased a 50mm prime lens and a 17-50mm zoom digital lens to complement the camera. The shots I have taken since the switch are like night and day compared to the digital cameras that I owned prior to this one.
I can honestly say people now come up to me after seeing my photos and complement me much more often then before.... even my wife has noticed the difference in my photos, that a large percentage more of my pictures turn out so much better than before. I'd like to think I found a camera that will now let me grow and develope, that compliments anyones style and lets you experiment with as much as you have time for.
I look forward to years of learning with this camera and recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade to a prosumer model.

Title: Seems OK
Content:
Don't know what all the hoop-la is about the top being difficult to get off; it works fine, no problems at all. However, I have encountered difficulties switching from 'Auto" to "ON" when I wanted to make coffee immediately.  It might have been me, but I'm pretty sure it was the pot. Had to reset the time so I could make coffee immediately.  All in all, it seems pretty good, but size # 4 filters are bit too big for the holder; you have to stuff them down to fit.  Yes, I would buy it again.

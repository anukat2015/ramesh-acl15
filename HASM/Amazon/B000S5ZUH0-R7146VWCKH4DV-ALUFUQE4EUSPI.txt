Title: Good player, better support and it would easily be an IPOD killer
Content:
I purchased the archos 605 wifi after running out of room on my 16 gig creative zen for my music library. The great thing is the archos holds 160 gbs and has a beautiful touch screen which means you can bring tons of music, movies, and photos anywhere you go. It's a little on the big side for a portable gadget but still in size tolerance for portable. I do have some complaints that prevent me from rating 5 stars though. 1: The support...it's as bad as everyone says. I bought the GPS attachment and the map codes just did not work. All the customer service needs to do to remedy this is to generate new map codes for me but nooo they prefer just to ignore my e-mails. The archos website makes it seem like you're going to get great support with the interactive support design but then no one ever gets back to you! How does a company make such a great device and then just ignore customer service?! 2: I haven't seen anyone else mention this but it pisses me off, there is no search ability in the music player. I have a lot of music and a keyword search like my zen has would be GREAT. 3: The battery life, enough has been said on it but all and all that would be my least complaint about the device. I find it gets about 9 hours music playing and about 4 hours video.
Anyway, Archos has made a great product here with the capabilities to bury the IPOD touch if they would but any effort into pleasing their customers after the initial sale.

Title: I am so pleased with this camera
Content:
This is my first DSLR (though by no means my first digital camera: I've had a Powershot G1, Olympus C8080WZ & a Lumix LX-2). I've been refusing to buy a DSLR mostly because I've been annoyed with Canon & Nikon (they seem mostly to be about defining and farming market niches) and Olympus isn't there yet (limitations with Dynamic Range and viewfinder size). I've never owned a Pentax before but the more I read about it, the more I liked it on paper. Now that I've got it, I like it even better. The camera offers tremendous flexibility and control in a very straightforward way. If you're an enthusiastic amateur, want to take beautiful pictures, and don't want to have to spend an arm and a leg to do it, you should absolutely consider buying the K20D.

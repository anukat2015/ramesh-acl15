Title: Avoid like the plague
Content:
I bought this because of its specs. Cooled close to expectations given the room and conditions.  Worked for one summer. Summer #2 - after the warranty expired - the exhaust squirrel cage fan blades disentigrated. I believe the plastic fan housing warped allowing contact with the blades.  Called Soleus to buy a replacement.  Once the phone mail hell finally answered my call without hanging up, the obviously new customer service rep after several false starts finally advised me they do not sell parts but for $45/hr will troubleshoot and fix the system - just bring it in.  They are in El Monte, Ca.  I am not.  Cheap materials - lousy support.

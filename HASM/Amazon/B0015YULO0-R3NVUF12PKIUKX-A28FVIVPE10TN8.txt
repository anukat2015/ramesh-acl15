Title: DON'T BUY!!!!
Content:
Waste of MONEY-very expensive. Not for a busy household- "good" as a showoff for friends who do not vacuum. Not practical,not easy to use,HEAVY(if you have stairs-it is a killer).Water container too small for a job!!!-I have to change water every 15 min. Difficult to clean after vacuuming. Now I have to clean a vacuum and a bathtub(after dealing with water bucket). Carpet-floor attachment useless-does not stand up to a task. Not powerful enough. Go for a rainbow(I experienced its job for 10 years-much better product).I wish I never bought this product-BIG (EXPENSIVE) MISTAKE.

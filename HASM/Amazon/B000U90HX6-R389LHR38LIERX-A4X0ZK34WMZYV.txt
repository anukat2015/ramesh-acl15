Title: Looks like R2D2 but heats well
Content:
Strengths:
Powerful heater, it warms up a room fairly quickly.  The heated air can be directed horizontally or vertically with the vent control.  This heater would be a good choice in cold climates.
Thermostat seems pretty good at keeping the room at a constant temperture.
Has auto (thermostat controlled), low, high heating modes.  Only the low heating mode is quiet.
Cool to touch, can be placed against wall.
Remote control works well.
Weaknesses:
Unit is not as quiet as would be hoped.  This may be an issue if you are watching TV or going to sleep with the heater on.  In the low heat mode, the fan is fairly quiet, but then the heater will remain constantly on (the automatic mode that controls the heater using the thermostat uses both high and low heat modes).  The remote control can help alleviate this problem.
Unit is LARGER than most alternatives (be sure to note dimensions).  Not as easy to store in summer months.
Remote control "beep" from the unit is pretty loud.

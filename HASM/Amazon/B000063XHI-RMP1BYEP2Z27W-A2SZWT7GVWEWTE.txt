Title: The best of all thermal coffee makers.
Content:
This was the first themal pot coffee maker I bought and it is still going strong four or five years later. In the meantime (in different houses)  I have had a Cuisinart version and a Rowenta version and neither is as good or as easy to use as this one.  The Capresso even manages to have an interior that doesn't stain.  Good job!

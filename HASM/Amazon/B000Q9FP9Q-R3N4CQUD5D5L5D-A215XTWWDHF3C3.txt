Title: Not even close to what I expected
Content:
This product was not what I expected. I realized that this was not going to have the cooling power of an A/C, but I at least expected it to be a little bit cooling. This is pretty much a bigger more expensive fan. I filled the unit with water, ice and the ice packs included and I never felt the air coming from it any cooler. Unfortunately, the store I purchased it from does not take returns on coolers and I would have to return it to the manufacturer. I would have to pay return shipping fees and the manufacturer charges a 15% restocking fee...not worth it. So, looks like I'm stuck with it and now $100 short because of it. I just use it as a fan now, at least it works for that. I suggest you save your money up and buy a portable A/C instead. It will be a better investment.

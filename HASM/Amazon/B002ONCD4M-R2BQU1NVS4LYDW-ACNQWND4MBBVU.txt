Title: HP DV6-1350 LAPTOP
Content:
I am very satisfied with the computer. Buyers should be aware of Windows 7 however if they also use a PDA. Palm does not have a USB hotsync driver as of yet.  Bluetooth hotsync does work with a little work. I have recommended this particular model to several of my friends. The extended battery life is a definate advantage. Price could have been a little lower but it was well worth the purchase.

Title: Great heater!
Content:
I purchased this product a year ago and it has worked wonderfully in my finished basement. It keeps the whole room heated very well if I leave the door to the upstairs closed. Guests really appreciate the warmth since the basement traditionally is very cold.
We're now using it at our office because of the very cold weather and it's doing a great job keeping the heat even throughout the back of the office (and  I sit next to a large drafty window). 
I don't have any problems with the temperature. Our office stays steady at 74, except in my area, but I can set it to 75 and the temp feels like the rest of the office. 
I also have very dry hands in the office and I feel no difference when this heater has been used the past two days here. Everyone in the office has been raving about the awesome design and the output it generates. 
I think it is well worth the price!

Title: Sadly disappointing!
Content:
I was very sad to return this coffee maker. I love the idea of a grind and brew unit. After a year of problems - the basket popping out mid-brew, getting stuck when I wanted it to open, and finally, coffee brewing OUT of the pot and on to my kitchen counter and floor...I called Cuisinart. I read the serial number on the bottom of the unit to the customer service rep who told me that it was under warranty for three years and to return it to place of purchase. I did.

Title: Husband loves this laptop!
Content:
My husband needed a new laptop for his home business.  He absolutely loves the HP Pavilion dv7-3060!  It is much lighter, quieter, and 100% cooler than his old HP Pavilion.  Boot-up is quick with Windows 7 compared to XP that took way too long.  He is completely satisfied with this laptop!  (Because it is a 64-bit machine, we had to buy a new wireless router.  Not a big deal since the new, updated router is a major improvement from the old one.)

Title: Great Camera for the money, but lots to learn
Content:
It's a great camera, with a lot of features to learn. And I reiterate, you have to have a quite a bit of time to learn some of 'em. 
Perfect for someone who wants to start photography as a hobby. 
The stock 18-55mm IS lens is a good lens but I suggest getting a second lens. (I went for the 75-300 Telephoto) Make the second lens you choose be for what you need it to be though. Do some research.

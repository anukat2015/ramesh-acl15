Title: Not a bad little heater - don't expect a furnace!
Content:
Ok, been using this heater for the last 2 months to heat a bedroom.
pros:-
nicely styled, remote control works well, timer, ECO mode - all good, will warm a large bedroom over about 30 mins
cons:-
the function and display could be better designes, takes a while to heat up, no way to turn off the LED display (glows all night), beeps when it turns off timer (can wake you up..!)

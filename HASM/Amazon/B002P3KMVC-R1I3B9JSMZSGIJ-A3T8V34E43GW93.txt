Title: Great laptop but definitely NOT a 10-12 hour battery
Content:
Excellent performance, size and display. Main drawbacks are that I don't get anywhere near 12 hours of battery life, even when I switch to battery saving mode. I have been averaging approximately 5-6 hours at best.
The touch pad is a bit finicky as compared to the HP zv5000 that I converted from.
Other than that, Excellent machine for the price.

Title: Ok but overpriced
Content:
We recieved this coffee maker as a gift when my well worn Mr. Coffee maker died after 3 owners and probably 12 years of service.  I will preface by saying that I would never pay $100 for a coffee maker that didn't do dishes as well.  I liked the color but found it difficult to program without reading the manual first and I'm not a fan of the loud beeping that signals that its done brewing since I have babies in the house.  Finally, if you don't double check that the carafe is fully pushed in then it will simply brew, overflow and fill your coffee with grounds which happens to me all the time if I don't check and double check that it's fully pushed in.  In a nutshell I am happy that I didn't personally shell out the dough for this appliance because it would have made me even more mad when it didn't work as well as one would expect for the money.  Also considering that all this thing does is brew coffee (no other features) you would be better off paying half the price for a different coffee maker to do the same thing.

Title: Great Product
Content:
I bought the Zune for a discounted price because I think the regular retail is way too high. I've had the Zune for a year and except for the New Years Eve glitch, the player has worked great for me. I bought a Altec Lansing docking system for the Zune as well as the Zune Car Pack so I have all the accessories I need to listen to it without the headphones. I also purchased the AC charger which seems to charge the unit faster than using the USB cord and laptop.

Title: My Ipod Nano works in My Stereo
Content:
I got the Nano 4g with 8gb of memory to replace my Mini 2g with only 4 gb of memory. I knew there was a high chance that it wouldn't charge on my Memorex stereo but I was very pleasantly surprised to find out it did work. I did have some problems with the genius because I live in Israel but other than that The new nano is a good investment and I am happy with it

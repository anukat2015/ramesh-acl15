Title: Works Great.... for a while
Content:
I initially purchased this vacuum about a year ago and had to replace my first model within a few months. The brush would stop spinning at times regarless of what height setting I would use. Thinking I purchased a bad vacuum I decided to purchase the same model again. I now find myself in the same predicament. The brush stops at times while I vacuum regardless of the height setting. Yes, this vacuum works great and I was amazed of how much cat hair it picked up when I first purchased it. However, it doesn't work well for a long time!!! $300 down the drain since I purchased two within 1 year. It works great but if you want a long lasting vacuum... this isn't it.

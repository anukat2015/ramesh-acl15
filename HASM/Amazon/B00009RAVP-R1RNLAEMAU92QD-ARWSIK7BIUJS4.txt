Title: Awesome product
Content:
I really love this heater.  It is energy efficient and effective.  Of course it is warmest when used as a spot heater, but overall, it makes my large bedroom much more comfortable.  It does glow, so that may bother you if you are trying to sleep with it on, but I find the glow (kind of like a glow from a fireplace) comforting.  Highly recommended!

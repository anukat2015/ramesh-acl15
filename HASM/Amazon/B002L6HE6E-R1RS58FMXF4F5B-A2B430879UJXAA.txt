Title: Now he would prefer an MP3 player
Content:
Got this for my grandson for Christmas when he said all his friends have an ipod.  His mother preferred an MP3 player and his brother got an MP3 player for his birthday (after the holiday).  Now he has seen what versatility the MP3 player has (download music and audio books) he would prefer an MP3 player.  The ipod is limited to only getting downloads from itunes.  He hates the limitation.  MP3 players can get music from many sources one of which is Amazon.  There are websites with free audio book downloads.
Much prefer an MP3 player.

Title: Great entry level camera
Content:
I moved to my first DSLR from a Canon S5 IS. Great machine. Feels just about right in terms of weight, size and handling. I do miss the variety of functions the S5 had but I guess that comes at a price for better image quality, interchangeability of lenses and versatility of shooting.
I could have technically waited a month more for the T1i but I decided not to spend 200 bucks more for having a movie feature in my SLR. I am looking forward to buy some more lenses (50 mm prime to start with) and take some cool pics.
Overall, I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. The reason why it is not a 5 star purchase is that the kit, did not surprise me with its performance (which may be just because I am new to DSLRs).
It is sure the best purchase for an entry level feature packed DSLR.

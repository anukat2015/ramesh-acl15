Title: So good, when I broke it, I bought another...
Content:
Might be the best coffee maker ever made. Simply designed, it brews a good cup conistently. Never leaks. Don't get suckered into getting one with a coffeegrinder built-in, when that grinder goes kaput (which it will do much more frequently than the maker itself) you will have to replace the unit. Also, the carafe keeps the coffee hot for a good 24hours. No need to use a burner (fire hazard). 
Hold on...I know what you are thinking...you are saying: "you saidf in the title it broke? what gives?" No worries. I moved and mishandled it in-transit. We tried to carry on with my fiance's coffeemaker, and it just didn't cut it. So, we actually replaced it and now have two carafes (easier to make decaf for company).

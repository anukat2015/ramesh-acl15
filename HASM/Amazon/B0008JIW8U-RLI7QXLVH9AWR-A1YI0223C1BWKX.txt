Title: Coffee tastes like plastic and clock doesn't work
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for several years but rarely use it.  As others have noted, the clock doesn't work, but the most important thing you should know is that it makes your coffee taste like plastic, even after years!  Yuck!  N.B. I did not purchase this coffee maker from Amazon.  If I had, I'm sure Amazon would have been great about a return. I just wanted to caution any potential buyers of the product.

Title: I love this coffeemaker!
Content:
I love this coffeemaker. I have hot coffee waiting for me when I get up. My husband gets up anywhere from 1-3 hours after I do, and he also has hot coffee waiting for him--no need to make another pot! I have not had any issues with noise or dribbling over the counter. I really can't think of any faults at all. The only thing I can think of is the cap your supposed to put on top to keep the coffee fresh has a tendency to disappear, but I'm sure this says more about us than it does about the coffemaker. Love it!

Title: The Keurig package to buy, but only if you can find a bargain
Content:
We've had ours for about two weeks and it is exactly what we wanted it to be. The coffee it makes is excellent, and with this particular package you're not locked into the (rather expensive) K-Cups since it comes with a My K-Cup filter for your own coffee, and if you don't mind paying for the K-Cups there's still a huge selection available, starting with Keurig's parent company Green Mountain Coffee and extending to several other smaller specialty coffee roasters. It's dead simple to use and even knocks out a couple of useless features from the B70 model (the unnecessary temperature control and the pathetically weak 11-oz serving size). On the whole, this package is an excellent bargain for a single-serve coffee maker -- if you know where to look. 
I'm not too sure what's going on with the pricing on Amazon's partners here, but we wound up buying ours at a warehouse store and saving thirty dollars off the street price for a B70; considering what the K-Cups go for and how much the filter adapter costs, we essentially got the coffee maker for not much more than the price of the Mini. The price difference between there and here led me to knock a star off the rating. The upshot, though, is that if you're going to buy a Keurig brewer and you don't think the Keurig Mini will suit your needs (the B77 has a water tank suitable for 4-6 people), this is the brewer and package to get.

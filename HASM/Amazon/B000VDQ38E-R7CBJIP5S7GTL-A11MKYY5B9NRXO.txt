Title: Clogged after 9 months
Content:
I purchased this vacuum about a year ago and it stopped working 3 months ago.  During its life-span, I was never impressed.  It would vacuum no different than my hoover, which had not a single "pet" feature, and I often had to "self-service" this vacuum in between uses in order to clear it of clogs I could reach. I finally got the chance to take it into a Bissel Service Center recently to be told the motor was clogged with hair and it would be $50 to repair.  I'm paying that amount only to have something to tide me over until I can buy something better.  The repairman asked me what types of animals I had.  I have one--a medium short-haired mutt.  He said the amount of hair in the motor would make him think I had several huskies. That means hair has been entering the motor since day one. He also told me that he gets more of this type of vacuum in for repair than any other and referred to it as "junk". It hurts to hear, even though I already knew it.  He recommended a bag vacuum over a bagless any day. I might just take him up on that advice....

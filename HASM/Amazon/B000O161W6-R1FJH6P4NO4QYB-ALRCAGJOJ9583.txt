Title: We love this camera
Content:
Others with more experience and knowledge have provided great information in their reviews. 
I only wish to say that this is our first SLR in many years and we debated between this and the D80 and decided, with some trepidation, the D40X was the right choice. After two months using it, we are very happy with the camera. It is fast (no noticeable lag when pressing the shutter) and takes great pictures. We were surprised that you cant use the LCD for framing pictures (I guess that is true for all SLRs?) so it took us some time to get used to using the view finder, but we are happy with that too.
Nikon just came out with the D60 which is about a hundred and twenty dollars more. It has some advanced sensor cleaning technology and updated software but I think we still would go with the D40X since these don't seem worth the price. The sensor cleaning is probably only worth it if you change lenses a lot (we only have the one) and thus expose the sensor. We could have returned the D40X (the D60 was announced within our return period) but we decided to keep it.
In summary, a great camera for those making the jump from point and shoot to SLR.

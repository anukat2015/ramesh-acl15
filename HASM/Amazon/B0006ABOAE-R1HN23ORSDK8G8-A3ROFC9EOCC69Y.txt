Title: adequate... far from stellar
Content:
This is functional, but like most items that perform multiple tasks it does not seem to do any one well. Ours was receives with a broken hinge on the lid that after dealing with the particular seller for over a month for delivery we just did not feel it was worth exchanging. 
Gripes: We have to hold the lid of the caraf open to pour or coffee ends up on the counter more than in the cup. frother positioning... would be great for a leftie.
Wanted features: timer as mentioned, and available in higer level purchases.
This make good coffee and espresso, but I feel it will be a temporary item in my kitchen.

Title: Don't underestimate 6 megapixels
Content:
I've been using this camera for a year, and continues to surprise. I recommend Ken Rockwell's WEB page on this camera to optimize settings; example color saturation setting. I recently viewed a tv program of a professional outdoor cameraman, looking carefully for the camera he used. It was a Nikon D1x, sporting 5.5 megapixels. Though not to confuse the D70s with the D1x, it does imply something about the megapixel hyperbole. I personally like RAW (some don't), and with Capture NX, is a great complement to the D70s. The manual mode (for me) is sometimes frustrating using the kit lens in getting the focus perfect; am considering a viewfinder adaptor to improve this aspect.

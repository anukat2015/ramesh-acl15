Title: HP Reliability and Customer service I found Pathetic
Content:
I purchased an HP DV9420 HP Pavilion DV9420US 17-inch Laptop (AMD Turion 64 Processor TL64, 2 GB RAM, 240 GB Hard Drive, Vista Premium)in early 2008. Within 5 months the display starting going out. I checked HP's web site and saw that HP was replacing the mother board on my model due to a design flaw for my exact problem.  HP tech support told me to send it in. I did and I heard nothing from HP for many weeks. I checked on line to see a bill for ~$800. I called and they stated that my laptop must have had water spilled on it and they would not repair under warranty. I told them this was completely untrue and to send me the detail of where the water was found when they returned it as I was not going to pay over 1/2 the cost of the original computer. Needless to say they did not send the detail. 
I sent the $1300+ laptop to an outside repair shop that replaced the motherboard for $300. I asked if they saw any signs of water damage and they stated they had not. 
I am in the processes of recommending replacement laptops for my office and purchasing several as gifts and due to this experience I am through with HP. I have used HP hardware for decades and find they are they are no longer the reliable HP of old.

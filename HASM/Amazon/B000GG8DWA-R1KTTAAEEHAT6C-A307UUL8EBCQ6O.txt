Title: Gets me hot...
Content:
Great little heater. I'm buying 2 more over the next 6 months. No noise and nothing blowing around. I don't use the main heating systems in either home so these are perfect.
Everytime I check the price on these it's gone up.. I'd buy now if you're considering it. Its seems inflation is beginning to effect things like this. I purchased one for 25 and change just a couple of weeks ago. I liked it so I went to buy another and it had gone up 10% in one  week. It's now up another 5%.

Title: Piece Of Junk
Content:
We bought this air conditioner in June of 2008.  It ran during daytime hours from June until October.  Last weekend, the compressor died.
The air conditioner is under warranty, but the warranty requires that the owner pay the cost of shipping the unit to the nearest repair center.  We're in Texas, the nearest repair center is in Tampa, Florida.  Shipping will cost over $100.
For a $500 unit to break down 4 months after purchase is unacceptable.  To then be forced to pay over $100 in shipping costs in order to get warranty service is unbelievable.  
Save your money, find a different unit that will meet your needs.  As it stands, I'm either out the $500 we paid for the unit or I have to cough up an additional $100+ to ship it to Tampa for repairs.  Astonishing.
DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK

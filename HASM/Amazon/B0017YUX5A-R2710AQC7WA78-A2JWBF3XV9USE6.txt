Title: Excellent quality. Fairly light. Nice features.
Content:
The ONLY thing I dislike is there is no brush head lock. You pick it up and it swings & bangs the ground. That makes it slightly floppy and awkward to carry. But it is powerful, slick and has a few nice features that I really wanted. I especially love being able to set it on its end without blocking the exhaust (goes out the top) Only feature it doesn't have that I knew when purchasing, was a unit on/off switch on the handle. The switch it does have is for the electric in the brush head (stops the bristles from spinning).

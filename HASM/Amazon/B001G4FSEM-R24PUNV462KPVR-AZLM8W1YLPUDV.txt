Title: not for garage
Content:
I tried 3 other space heaters (all 1500 watt) before I purchsed this unit. I even called Pelonis for their recommendation. This unit was by far the most expensive of all that I tried, I paid $90 I believe. I don't believe this unit puts out any more heat than the other fan driven space heaters I bought. This unit may subsidize heat in a bedroom, but it will not warm a garage space at all. It will only warm the parts of you it is blowing on, which need to be within 3 feet of the unit. The unit appears to be manufactured well, I have not put it through any abuse yet, so I would recommend it only for extra heat in an enclosed area.

Title: i used to love all things pink, but this just sucks
Content:
After charging all night, I attempted to turn this mp3 player on and no luck. I heard nothing. Since there is no screen or noise, I had no idea what was wrong. I thought maybe there was no music on it, but then I reconnected to my computer and it was preloaded with several songs. Then I went to the creative zen website to try to find more information and nothing helped. Therefore I sent the player back.

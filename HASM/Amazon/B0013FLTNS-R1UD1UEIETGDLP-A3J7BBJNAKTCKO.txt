Title: Great MacBook Laptop - even if discontinued
Content:
I am really enjoying my Apple MacBook Pro 2.5G, even if it is discontinued model. The new MacBook Pro's are very attractive, but I am not too fond of the keyboard, and (most important), they no longer have both the Firewire 400 (MHz) and 800 (MHz) ports. I use a Sony HDV Video Camera, which communicates with the Mac via Fire 400, and I also use an external Media Hard Drive via Firewire 800. Yes, I know that I can use the ExpressCard, but I don't really need it as the Firewire 400/800 combo works just fine! My only problem is trying to collect my purchase rebate from Amazon.... The original description was for an on-line rebate, but when I tried it - it came back as expired. When I call Customer Service, they said I should have had paper work with the unit. None was included, so they were going to send me the forms... A week later, nothing has arrived, and I am nearing the end date.... Otherwise, fast shipment and a great product......

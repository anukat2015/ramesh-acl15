Title: Laptop doesn't come with the right GIGABYTE!!!
Content:
I purchased this laptop from Amazon on Nov 20, 2009. It reached me on Dec 1, 2009.
The spec on the laptop told me that it has 4g memory and 320G hardrive...when I received the laptop 
the first thing I did was to check the hard drive, well, it says that I only have 269 free space of 290G. 
What I want to know is where is my extra 30G? 
Secondly, I don't if it's the windows 7 that's doing it, but this laptop has a mind of it's own. It keeps opening programs for me that I don't even click on. I can't browse any application without it opening without my command.

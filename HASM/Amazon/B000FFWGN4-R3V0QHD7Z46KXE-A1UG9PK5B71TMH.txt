Title: Its Unbelievable!
Content:
I purchased a new home and this new Bissell Lift-Off Revolution Pet Vac.  It picks up the finest of dust particles.  They laid my carpet too soon causing a build up of construction/dry wall dust.  This vac is still lifting out fine dust after two months.  The little side compartments take no time filling up.  When that happens, you just pull it out and then dump it out.  It is that easy!  I also have a collie who sheds a lot, that is no problem for this vac.  I LOVE IT!   Highly recommend!

Title: Dimplex Compact best portable heat source  for the money
Content:
I purchased this product for its nice looks at first ...then when i used it ,i couldn't believe how fast and hot this item worked to heat my bedroom 14 x 16  ...I have  to get up in the middle of the  night and turn it off ...also I use a ceiling fan to circulate the  heat as well ...I have  5 people ,5 electric stoves in my home  as a main source of heat ..my bill with other electric appliances , tv 's ,washer ,dryer and lights   was only $ 115.00 this  month ....I have  oil heat  but keep my regular thermostat on 58 due to over $3.30 a gallon for  oil  ...This  product works  better and even saves more money on electric  then even those infrared or those  Amish  heaters  that are advertised lately  using 12 cents an hour to heat your home ...Beware of those ...I've tried them  also .....a lot higher bills then they stated ...Dimplex is the way to go ...its quiet ,efficient,and looks  great ..5 stars  from me ...=0)  Happy Glowing......

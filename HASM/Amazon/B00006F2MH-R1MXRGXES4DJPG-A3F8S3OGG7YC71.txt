Title: Not that hard to clean
Content:
I've owned this model for the past 2 years and really have not found cleaning to be an issue.  Everyday I just dump the filter basket and give it a quick rinse along with the actual coffee pot, then weekly all of the other parts (grinder, basket, fliter, coffee pot, chute, etc) all go into the dishwasher on the top rack.  So far no problems!  The only monor complaint is the occasional "sludge" that drips down the back behind the pot, but that wipes up easily with a damp sponge.
Makes some great coffee!

Title: What disapointment !
Content:
I purchased the package over the internet since I live outside US, and asked to ship it to a company i visit often in Oregon. The shipment arrived as planned but when I opened the package i found out that the telephoto lens is not working, when you rotate the zoom ring the movement is not smooth, you have to apply force and it is difficult to get to the zoom you want because the movement is in fragments. Also the camera bag is very low quality and one of the zippers is getting stuck all the time and you need to use only the other zipper. last but not least the memory stick, it does not seem to function and since there are no instructions or manual my assumption was that you need just to insert it and the installation procedure will lead you step by step to completion but no, nothing happens just a red light on the memory stick. It feels like being stuck in a red light forever. and to think that I agreed to pay more for this package because it is coming from a big and what I thought reliable vendor like Amazon . . .
now I need to start international discussions to see how to get good products instead of the defected ones I got. Very very frustrating!

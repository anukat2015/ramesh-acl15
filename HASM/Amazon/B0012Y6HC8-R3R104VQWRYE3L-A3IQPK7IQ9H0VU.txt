Title: What a Camera!
Content:
If your an amature photographer, this cameras for you. We recently purchased this camera two days before our trip to Alaska. The auto feature really helped us get through our trip with beautiful pictures. In no time we were able to learn some of the functions, allowing us to be creative with our shots. The quality of the pictures are exceptional, you will not be disappointed.

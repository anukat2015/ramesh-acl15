Title: I love it!
Content:
I shopped around for an SLR that would be user friendly along with having a wide range of functions. I am very pleased with this camera. It is light weight yet does everything a heavier, bulkier camera would do. It comes with 2 lenses so you can cover the spectrum of ranges for taking most any picture you want. It may not please the most fussy but for the average photographer looking to upgrade from a simple point-and-shoot in order to take close-up shots to long distance shots without blurred images this is a great camera. The Olympus web site is excellent, too for instructions and general photo taking lessons.
I am very happy I purchased this camera rather than a more expensive one.

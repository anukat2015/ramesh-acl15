Title: Ditto "shuts off in 5 mins or less"
Content:
I also see the "shuts off in 5 mins or less" problem.  The heater stops and it flashes its little red lights.  For the price, this heater is a piece of junk.  The only thing it can do for me now is tell the room temperature, on the remote.  (I am assuming the number it shows me is right; maybe that's not right either.)

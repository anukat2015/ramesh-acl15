Title: I'm very pleased.
Content:
Like most people, I was a little apprehensive towards switching to Mac.  I can honestly say that I'm so happy I did.  The main thing that I love is I can surf the web and download apps without worrying about catching a virus!   Also everything seems to work fine with this machine.  With PC it seems like I always had problems or little error windows popping up.  I've only had it for a couple of months, but it's been totally carefree.  It's so worth the price.

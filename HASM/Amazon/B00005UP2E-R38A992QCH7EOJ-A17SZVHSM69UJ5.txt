Title: works ok
Content:
im not happy with this vacuum at all. the attachments are made of cheap flimsy plastic. doesn't pick up stuff off the carpet very good. i have to go back and forth over things that are just laying there in order to suck them up. really wish i had bought something else. but it will have to do.

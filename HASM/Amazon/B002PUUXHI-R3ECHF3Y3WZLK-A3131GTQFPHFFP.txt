Title: DISAPPOINTMENTED
Content:
Coffee is bland with an off flavor.  Coffee is not hot.  We have an older model Cuisinart thermal coffee maker that makes wonderful, hot coffee--the coffee stays hot all day.  We wanted to upgrade to a smaller version 10 c. thermal coffeemaker and are really disappointed in this model.  We would not recommend this model.

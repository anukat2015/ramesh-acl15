Title: another hapless victim
Content:
I received the iPod Shuffle as a Christmas gift and was very excited to try it. Over the past few years I have been using an iRiver MP3 player and have been very pleased with it, but I've always felt somewhat constrained in terms of storage capacity.
The iPod Shuffle seemed like the ideal solution--it is even smaller and more streamlined than my iRiver, but with more storage space. Alas, things did not work out as I had hoped. I have been struggling with this piece of #@*$ since I took it out of the box. It causes my computer--which more than satisfies the hardware requirements outlined by Apple--to freeze. I've tried a number of fixes including updating the iTunes software, resetting the iPod to factory settings, etc. None of this worked. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm going to return the Shuffle and get the new iRiver.

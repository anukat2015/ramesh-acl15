Title: Quite impressed
Content:
I like it so much, may purchase another.  Works as designed.  The auto setting is a fantastic feature.  My son's room is the coldest at night, so I leave at about 70 in the auto.  The unit will hibernate when it hits 71 than cycle on when gets to 69.  Puts out impressive heat for a small unit.  I have been using the heater during the day to take the chill out of my family room/kitchen area.  Does a very good job considering the area is about 450 sq. ft.  All the features are well designed.  The blue lcd display is legible in all lighting.  A tad bright at night.  The remote stores on top of the unit under a tinted plastic access panel. The only cons I say and trust me, I'm being overly critical are as follows.  The lcd is bright at night, and the audible "BEEP" when adjusting temp etc. are loud.I think the "ionizer" is a marketing gimeck.  Other than that it is a fantastic heater at a great price.

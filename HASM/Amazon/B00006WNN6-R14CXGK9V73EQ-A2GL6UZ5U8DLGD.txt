Title: Fiddling Away
Content:
I agree with the other reviewers that this compact lightweight heater does warm up quickly.  The issue, however, is that it also shuts off after a few minutes.  In order to coax the unit back to life, I have to fiddle with the dials at the top for a little while.  It's surprisingly annoying.

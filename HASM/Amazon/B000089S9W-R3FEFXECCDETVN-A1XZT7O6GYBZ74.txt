Title: Have Used This For Years - The Best!
Content:
My husband and I have used this coffee maker for years.  It brews excellent coffee, is quiet, and has the feature where you can pour a cup of coffee before the entire pot is ready.  The area that holds the coffee grounds has a latch on it that rests against the rear of the carafe when it is in place on the heating element, so when the carafe is pulled away, the drip spout closes, and when the carafe is placed back on the burner, the drip spout is opened again, and brewing resumes.  This feature is usually only found on very expensive coffee makers.  Leave it to Black and Decker to make a lovely to look at, wonderful coffee maker.  This coffee maker also comes in a version that has a timer on it.  Amazon sells that coffee maker as well.  It is $10.00 more, and if you want that feature, you can purchase that one instead.  It is exactly the same coffee maker, only with the clock/timer on it. Also, I've always removed the lid on the carafe permanently, that way it is alot easier to wash each time and does not affect in any way the working of the unit.

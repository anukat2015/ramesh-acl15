Title: willnot make 2 cups
Content:
WHEN it works, coffee is great.  The problem is after brewing one cup the machine shuts off during reheat.  Since we received this B70 my wife and I cannot have coffee together!   I am now on my 2nd machine with the same problem.  Keurig takes 4-5 days to call back.

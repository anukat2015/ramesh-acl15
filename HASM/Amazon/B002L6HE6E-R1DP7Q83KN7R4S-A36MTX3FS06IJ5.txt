Title: Daughter loves it!
Content:
Purchased as a gift for my 16 year-old daughter. She uses it constantly. Loves the size and the fact it also has the radio and camera option. She had the older iPod and sold it to her brother for $12. Said she didn't need an iPod. She changed her mind when she got this one. It's here to stay. Pricing and delivery were very good from Amazon.

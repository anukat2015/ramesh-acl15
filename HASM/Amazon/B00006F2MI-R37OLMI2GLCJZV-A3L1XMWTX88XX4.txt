Title: Please DON'T waste your money!!!!!
Content:
This is the second piece of junk I have bought from Cuisinart!!  They are over priced pieces of junk!!  This coffee maker was a gift from my son only one year ago.  It is already disfuntional!!  It started when the grinder would go off randomly by itself, any time of day.  Then the "grind off" button would not even work!!  The other product I purchased from Cuisinart was a toaster.  The knob broke off only have a year also.  The biggest down fall, customer service at Cuisinart.  Don't think you'll be able to email or call and they will roll out the red carpet, they don't...you'll be lucky if they even respond!!  Stop buying their products!!!  Cuisinart does not back them!!!

Title: heater
Content:
Not a bad heater after all...I bought 2 of them because the reviews, but after I got them I opened only 1 and wasn't too happy with it until I tried it in a room with the door closed, and it did maintained a nice warmth once it was on for a few minutes. Since it was pretty efficient I decided to keep the other!

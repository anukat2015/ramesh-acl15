Title: Fantastic Little Thing!
Content:
Well, I had a couple of Netbooks in the past.  I had the original Aspire one, the Asus 1000HE and the Asus 1005HA.  Although all worked, they were slow.  I loved the battery life, but other than that, I found myself spending much more time doing simple things than on a regular size laptop.  Both because they were slow and also because I kept hitting wrong key, etc due to the size.  The 1000HE felt the best, but I had to give that away and the 1005HA I absolutely hated.
Anyway, I went for this Acer and I wouldn't be more amazed.  It is just as fast as a standard size laptop.  The screen is perfect.  It never hands, is fast, very fast and the battery lasts just as long as any of the netbooks I had.  The screen is large enough to do pretty much anything, the keyboard feels nice, the mouse buttons are great.  I couldn't be more amazed.  All this and the thing is the same weight as the netbooks and only slightly larger,  If you put it in your bag, you will not notice a difference.  I was so happy, I had to buy another one for my wife.
She loves it as well.

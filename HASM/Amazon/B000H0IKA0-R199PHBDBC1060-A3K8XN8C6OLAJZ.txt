Title: Lacking bass.
Content:
If you're picky about sound quality and about bass on your audio then stay away from this one. The size and price compromise too much of the audio quality and I'm dissapointed at apple for letting this one slide. Thank God I just bought this iPod as an alternative for when going to the gym.

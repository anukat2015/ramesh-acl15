Title: good media player, but podcast functions and controls lacking
Content:
I bought this portable media player to replace a first generation 30GB Microsoft Zune (the Zune replaced a 30G iPod Video).  
Pro: slim, stylish, quality construction, FM radio, live pause function, high video quality, high sound quality, video camera, genius function
Con: unable to use device to transfer audio/picture/video files from one computer to another, unable to access detailed descriptions of podcasts, controls can be difficult to use (cannot simply click up or down, must rotate thumb about control face - often overshoot desired selection), video camera lens is positioned behind controls - akward, iTunes software does not download artwork for many podcasts
Note: Zune has the functions that iPod lacks, but did not have a live pause function for FM radio or a video camera.
I would recommend this product for someone who needs something portable with ample storage for music files. I would recommend a Zune or other device for someone who uses podcasts regularly.

Title: Love it!
Content:
This was my first leap into the world of iPods and it fits my needs perfectly.  I love to listen to books on CD and just continue to load them up, listen to them and delete them.  I have dozens of music CDs on it and even more playlists, I have pictures to show off my kids and love to get the podcasts of the news.  I have thousands of songs and now I can get rid of all of those CD's that had just 1-3 songs that I cared for.  I am so pleased that I went with the higher memory from the start.  I have heard that this product is easily scratched so I simply ordered a clear case for it before I even ordered the iPod and the case has kept it scratch free.  Love it!!

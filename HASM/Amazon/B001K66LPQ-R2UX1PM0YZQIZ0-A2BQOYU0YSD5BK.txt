Title: poor design coffee maker!!!!!
Content:
This is the worse design coffeemaker I have ever bought, So many things are wrong with it, I regret not saving the receipt.  You have to take the thing half way apart to make coffee, Not fun in the a.m., it leaks all the time. when you press your cup against the dispenser it does not make it it to the cup always, my husband has a black cup, and is imposible to see where the coffee is going, leaking into the counter... the coffee does not get hot. I liked the old coffeemaker, we had a leak from the gasket, so we decided to get a new one, since we liked the old one so much, boy were we disapointed.  
Leaks, leaks leaks...

Title: Caught on fire
Content:
Our smoke detector went off at 1:30 am. We went to see why and our COFFEEMAKER was ON FIRE.  I cannot believe that this could happen. The back of the coffeemaker is melted and our countertops are ruined  I believe it was an electrical fire.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  IF YOU HAVE ONE, do NOT KEEP IT PLUGGED IN OVERNIGHT!!!

Title: Beautiful, Spectacular, Sexy
Content:
This is by far the best toy I have ever bought. It's absolutely beautiful, both the hardware and the operating system (OS X). I bought it primarily to edit digital video of my new baby. It's elegantly simple to download the video into iMovie and extremely intuitive to edit the video. I upgraded the hard drive to 30 gigs and the RAM to 256 Megs in order to give myself some head room. I thought I might not like the small screen but it seems not much less viewing area than my 17&quot; desktop monitor. I bought the iBook instead of the Titanium PowerBook because the PowerBook does not offer the DVD/CD-RW combo drive. I wanted to be able to burn the videos I made to CD as well as backup and archive files on my hard drive. I bought a mouse (Apple's optical mouse) beacuse I generally don't like trackpads. The single complaint I have is that the USB port is on the left side of the machine and I have to run the cord for the mouse under the computer to use it with my right hand. Otherwise I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.

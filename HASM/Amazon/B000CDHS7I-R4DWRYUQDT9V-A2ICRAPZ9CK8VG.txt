Title: Java Problems
Content:
I bought this Krups to replace a beloved Krups thermal carafe that sadly passed on. This new model features too many flaws. For one, the swing-open filter door doesn't always engage. Minor issue. If you pour your water into the machine too quickly, bubbles can form in the window, so you're never quite sure how much is in the machine. Further, my model always seems to leak both water and brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. Granted, it's only the size of a quarter or half-dollar, but you don't expect this from a Krups. Finally, the carafe, itself, pours so broadly that leaks are inevitable. Sadly, this product does not live up to the Krups' reputation.

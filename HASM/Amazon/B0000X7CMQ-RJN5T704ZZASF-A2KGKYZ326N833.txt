Title: Good but not great!
Content:
OK, like most of you I'm a coffee FREAK...for over 20 years I've been looking for the perfect coffee maker. I THOUGHT I found it with this one.
For a while it worked just GREAT!
Yes, the top of the carafe is hard to open unless you're Arnold...but I'll put up with almost anything for great coffee in the morning.
However the one thing that drives me NUTS is that it overflows and makes a mess all over the counter and floor. (This morning finally pushed me over the edge...thus...this review.)
I even returned this unit and got a completely brand new one and it too, after a year began exhibiting the same problem. Somehow, the coffee just does NOT drain properly out of the basket.
OK, so I grind my coffee almost to a fine powder...I like coffee strong...I want it to talk to me in the morning.
I GUESS that if you like your coffee weak then this is the coffee maker for you. For me...I've got to keep looking.

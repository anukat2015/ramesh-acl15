Title: Works fine, no problems whatsoever
Content:
I'm not sure why there are several negative reviews for this vacuum. It has a great price, works well on my carpets and floors, and is very easy to use. What's not to like?
Bottom line: I would not hesitate to buy another S3755 if I needed another vacuum cleaner.

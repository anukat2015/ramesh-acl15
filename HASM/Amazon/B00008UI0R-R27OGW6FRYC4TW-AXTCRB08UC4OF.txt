This vacuum is great. After using it for a couple of weeks I will never go back to my Oreck. I cannot believe the suction on this vacuum. My carpets look new again. I didn't realize how much my other vacuum was missing. I love the baglessness for 2 reasons (1) no bags to buy and (2) I can see all that is picked up. I don't even mind having to empty it every time I vacuum. I feel like a new bag is just put in. Much cheaper then putting a new bag in every time you use it to get a good preformance out of it. Its a keeper. Jo-Ann , Greenville, N.Y.

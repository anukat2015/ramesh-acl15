Title: Not a Professional Camera
Content:
This camera, as other D series cameras, has a serious limitation. It cannot be used on a bellows, a microscope or a T mount lens for automatic exposure. You have to set exposure manually by trial and error. If you only want to take conventional images with the lens systems that only Nikon will supply you there isn't a problem, but IF you expect exposure metering in the camera body, DO NOT BUY this camera.

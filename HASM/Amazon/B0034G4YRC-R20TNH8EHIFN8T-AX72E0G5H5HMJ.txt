Title: A Great Laptop
Content:
I purchased this laptop after 2 months of intense searching. My reason for choosing this laptop was "Best Bang For The Buck" I've now had this laptop for about 1.5 months (24x&) and it has excceded my expectations. I was able to restore all needed files from my HP Notebook. I'm a Web Designer and Developer so I run some process hungry applications. The i5 processor handles them fast and accurate. I would reccomend this laptop to my closest friends.

Title: Excellent value for basic computing needs
Content:
We were looking for an inexpensive laptop to use for basic computing needs - mainly e-mail, Internet browsing, working with some Microsoft Office programs, and the occasional watching of TV shows online. First I bought a refurbished laptop from a small local store. It seemed like a good value, a nice, but slightly older Dell model for $300. It came with a 3 months warranty, although the store clerk was quick to tell me that the warranty didn't cover the battery. I wasn't too concerned, until I realized that this battery wouldn't hold a charge AT ALL. Not even for 10 seconds. After learning that a replacement battery would cost around $90, I returned this refurbished laptop to the store and headed to Best Buy where I purchased the Acer Aspire 5532, brand new, for $349. So far it's served us very well. It's comfortable to use, nice looking, and more than sufficient for what we're using it for. The store sales clerk tried to steer me towards a Netbook, but the cost was comparable to the cost of this model, and I'm very glad we decided to go with the full laptop with the 15" screen - it's very nice for watching DVDs (this model plays HD movies also) and TV shows online. Really, the only thing I don't love about it is the shiny plastic exterior that shows every fingerprint and smudge.

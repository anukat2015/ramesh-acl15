Title: Completely exceeded my expectations!
Content:
When my handheld vacuum crapped out and I needed a new one, I found this one.  When it said it could pick up pet hair, I thought "yeah, right."  We have 2 dogs and 3 cats and my handheld and upright vacuum struggled to get the hair.  This one does it with ease!  I was floored with how easy it got the hair up!!!  I use the vacuum with the rotating brush piece on the "extender" hose.  I have to use 2 hands:  one on the handle of the dustbuster and one keeping the hose on the dustbuster.  A minor inconvenience to be rid of dog hair.  Hooray!!!!

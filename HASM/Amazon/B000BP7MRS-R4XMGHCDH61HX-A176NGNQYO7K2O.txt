Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
Maybe its the engineer in me but I was solely looking for a coffee pot that brewed a great cup of coffee as fast as possible. I used to have a Mr. Coffee and it was *painfully* slow. After reading some reviews, I decided to buy this coffee maker based on the claim that it brewed pretty fast. It does. For 6 cups of coffee, this maker brewed twice as fast as my Mr. Coffee (its been a couple months since I did this but I recall time being a bit over 2 minutes for 6 cups). I will say that I was using paper filters in my Mr. Coffee and the Braun had the wire filter that came with the product.  The Braun was already dripping coffee while Mr. Coffee was sitting around thinking about what to do. The time was a bit slower on the Braun once I used a paper filter but its still fast. Coffee tastes great! I haven't had issues with dripping or leaking. I'm totally stoked with this purchase! If  fast coffee is important to you - you'll like this coffee pot.

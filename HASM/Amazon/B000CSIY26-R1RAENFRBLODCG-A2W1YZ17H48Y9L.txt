Title: Not  Exactly as Advertised
Content:
Although we have come around to liking this product we were initally disappointed in what was sold as a unit that did not need draining.  It does need to be drained or it will automatically shut off after an hour and a half usage.  We have it on top of a bowl so that it can drain and thus stay on.  It cools the room well but is more work than we expected.  Just know what you are buying-an air conditioner that is not self draining!

Title: Never buy Compaq
Content:
I have tried this laptop and returned it within a week when it failed all my tests.  Compaq computers are not built to last, they have cheap unknown hardware and are slow within a month becasue of it.  Compaq customer support is non-existant and your luck if the computer lasts more than a year.  No wonder Compaq ere rated the worst company that makes the worst computers etc.. 3 years running.

Title: Nano power
Content:
Great iPod, the graphics are incredible, sound is very clear.  Storage capacity is excellent.  The sound through the ear buds is crisp and clear so high volume is not necessary.  You can still hear your surroundings and still hear the music clear. Recommend getting an arm band or some kind of holster to keep it from falling out of your pockets though.

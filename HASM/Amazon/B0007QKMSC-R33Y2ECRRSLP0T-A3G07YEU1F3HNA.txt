Title: First SLR
Content:
I just paid 500 for this thing and I haven't been feeling any buyer's remorse, yet. I've been comparing photos from past point and shoot pictures to the XT's. I chose 2 photos taken with flash and auto focus, from fairly close, and that are roughly the same size: 3264 X 2176 compared to the XT's 3456 X 2304. I am viewing both in the Microsoft Office Picture Manager. The one from the point and shoot gets blurry at about 90%. The XT starts to get blurry at 250%. Whatever that means, I have no idea. To me it means that the APS-C sensor size is doing its job. Is it 100 dollars better then the point and shoot? YES. I think the zooms are the same with the lens that's on it now. Close ups look alot less distorted with the XT. In auto mode the XT is just as easy to use, except it takes pictures faster. And it's cooler to have a camera that looks like a camera. The only bad thing is that now I have to get a telephoto zoom lens because I want one. So, for 500 it's worth it without a doubt except for the fact that it's making me want to spend 200 more on a lens.
***UPDATE - I've been playing with this camera for a few days now and I'm still happy with it. First, somebody said the thing is for small handed people. I'm a big mo-fo and my hand fits fine. I'm also impressed with battery life. The battery got low at 250 pics, but it still doesn't need to be charged yet at 375. The only thing I don't like is the battery meter it only has 3 settings: ok, low, and must be charged(which I havn't seen yet.) I also like how fast pictures can be taken, autofocus is fast too.

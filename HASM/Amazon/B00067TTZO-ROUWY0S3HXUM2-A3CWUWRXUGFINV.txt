Title: Great when it works
Content:
Disgusted with apple's terrible customer service, I vowed never to buy anything apple again and jumped at the micro. For a while it worked very well. Yes, it would often start "rebuilding the library" for no good reason. And it often seemed twitchy - but I was willing to overlook these flaws. In fact, I bought one for my girlfriend's birthday. BUT, that one had to be returned to creative after less than 2 weeks, when it just froze. It was still within the 90 day window when creative will fix it no questions asked - which was great. Fastforward a few months and now mine is broken too!! What gives?? Obviously mine is well past the 90 day window and even though its still within the 1 year warranty period, Creative wants money to fix it.
Thats rich.
Save yourself the headache. The quality control on this thing is terrible. When it works it works well. But more often than not its acting up.

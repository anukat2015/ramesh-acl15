Title: Excellent Vacuum
Content:
I waited several months after purchasing this vacuum to do a review on it. So far, it's absolutely excellent. It's powerful, the attachments work well, it's easy to move around, and the quality is fine. No problems at all. The only potential drawback is the small capacity of the dust container. I have a yellow lab that sheds constantly. When I vacuum once a week, I need to empty the dust container at least 4 times. (terrible for a 1200 foot house!). Other than that, you will be hard pressed to find a better canister vacuum for the price.

Title: Kurv ~ It's a Keeper!
Content:
Makes clean-up quick and simple.
Easy to use and clean (empty after use).
Attractive enough to keep out at all times and therefore available for use at anytime. 
Holds the charge well.
Amazing what it picks up that you don't even see!
Love the Kurv and recommend it highly!
Thank you Dirt Devil for a wonderful product and Amazon.com for a fantastic price!
(A previous review had mentioned debris coming out of the exhaust vents but in actuality it is just the exhaust blowing around dust, dog hair, etc. that is on the surface being cleaned. The filter is not allowing debris to escape from the vacuum.)

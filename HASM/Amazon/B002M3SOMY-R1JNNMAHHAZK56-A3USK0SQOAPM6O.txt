Title: Not for runners (or for anyone)
Content:
This is impossible to use if you run. The controls are on the wires, which bounce around while you run. This makes it impossible to control. If you wear gloves in the winter, forget about it. The headphones have horrible wind noise. My ears were ringing that night. You can't use other headphones. 
I ended up making in no more than a mile with these things on my first run. The next time I made it two blocks before I ran home and got an old school radio. Apple needs to actually test these products with real people before selling them.

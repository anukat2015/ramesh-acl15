Title: Not so good, but you can water your plants
Content:
We got one of these when our air went out.  12x15 room so about 180sf.  It would never get it down to under 78, plus here in Arkansas you have to empty the water bucket (around a quart and a half maybe) about 5 times in a 24hr period to keep it running.  If you forget, it shuts off when the bucket is full to prevent overflow. That's also when it starts getting hot again.  It probably works ok as a suplemental room conditioner to add a little boost, but it will not cool a 200sf area when it's hot.  You have to vent it out a window anyway so why not just put in a little window unit.  The one we exchanged it for (GE as well) works much better and you don't have to get up in the middle of the night and empty the bucket into your Elephant Ear.

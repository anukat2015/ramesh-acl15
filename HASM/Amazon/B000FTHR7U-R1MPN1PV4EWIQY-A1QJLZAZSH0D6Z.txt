Title: Great value for the money - feels great in my hands!
Content:
I put off buying a Digital SLR for 3 years - but couldn't resist this one now that the price is under $[...]. I handled a Pentax *ist DS at a Costco and was impressed with its handling - this one feels even better. I found the Canon Digital Rebel and even the Nikon D50 to be a little awkward - just a little large for me - and I'm over 6'2" with pretty large hands. I had good experience with an old Pentax 35 mm camera, so feel pretty confident about it's operational ease and quality. But only time will tell that. The 2.5" LCD panel is wonderful - much easier than the old 1.6" I've used in my Nikon Coolpix 775 and 5400. And of course, the operational speed is much nicer than those older cameras - but pretty typical of the other DSLRs out there.
The few flash pictures I've taken look bright and very sharp - look forward to taking many more outside tomorrow - or whenever the weather clears a little here in Cleveland...

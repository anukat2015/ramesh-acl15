I bought this because the other two reviews said it was loud, and I wanted it for white noise, along with the heat.  I do not think it's too loud, but I like to sleep to noise, so guess it all depends.  It is too small for our bedroom to produce a lot of heat, but I use it on the fan setting for the noise effect!

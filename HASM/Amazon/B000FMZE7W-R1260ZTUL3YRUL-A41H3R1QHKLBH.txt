Title: I PURCHASED MINE
Content:
I purchased mine yesterday from a local Bestbuy (Opening day) so far I really like this guy. There are a few things that Microsoft should change but the overall device is great. Here are my thoughts. 
Positives - 
- The screen is very clear... none like it
- I purchased the Brown and love the look.
- FM radio is very clear and picks up great
- Video is sharp 
- Menu on device is very easy to use and had great features like adding to quicklist. 
- The texture of the device is really cool. It looks like it should last a really long time. 
Negatives - 
- Its rather big for a 30 gig but its still a good size. Its not too big and bulky. 
- HATE! The PC software. The software that you us to move your songs over is HORRIBLE. It needs a ton of work. I am a Network Admin and know my computer software... and this one was complicated to figure out at first look. After playing with it for a hour I started to fugure out how to use it. I understand it now but still do not like the software. If you have a hard time using itunes, then you will have an even harder time using this sotware. This is the only downfall I have really found with this guy. The software automatically starts to sync ALL your music in youe "My Music" folder to your Zune. (I have 80 gigs of music that I do not want on there) Another big mistake with the software.
- It only comes with a USB connection and head phones.

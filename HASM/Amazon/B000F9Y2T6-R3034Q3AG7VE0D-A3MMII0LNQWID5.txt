Title: If you have animals, don't get this for hair removal!
Content:
I was so excited after reading the other people's reviews. I read about the Swiffer and how it would "leak." This one doesn't leak. One good point. It just doesn't get up the the debris first -- before you mop. I have three dog's and they, ugh, shed. Another item that's a complete rip off to those of you in my predicament, is the "Shed Ender." It doesn't end it. If any of you out there have a solution to my dilemma, I'd be most appreciative. If you don't have a solution and hope this is it, DON'T!

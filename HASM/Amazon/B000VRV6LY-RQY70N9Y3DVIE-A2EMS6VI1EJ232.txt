Title: Nikon D3 audio recording capability, Live View, 28-300mm lens
Content:
I rarely see anyone mention one important benefit of the D3 as compared to the D300: the ability to easily record audio .wav file memos at the push of a button. For anyone who would like a quick and easy way to include a note to go along with a photo that's just been shot (for example, the name and title of the person being photographed), or perhaps record some audio to go along with the subject of the photos (like the music from a carousel being shot), this neat feature can't be beat. I first had it on my D100, thanks to the optional base that also doubles the battery capacity. The optional base for the D200 and D300 do not have that audio recording capability, so that omission was a significant factor in my decision to buy a D2X instead when I was ready for a better camera than my D100. As they say, "try it, you'll like it." I still use my D100 and D2X when I don't want to change lenses in the field, but the D3 is way better. The low light capability is incredible and the "Live View" feature is great when I need to hold my camera over people's heads and still be able to see what I'm about to shoot. I can't wait to see what Nikon brings out to replace the D3! One thing I would like Nikon to do is bring out an equivalent to Tamron's very useful 28-300mm, non-DX compact zoom lens (so yes, it works well with the D3). When I have to travel light, that lens just can't be beat. I've been happily using it since I bought it back when I only had my D100 and needed to stick to a tight budget. The story I keep getting from Nikon vendors and reps alike is that if Nikon made it, it would be way too expensive. Really? Since when did price stop people from buying Nikon lenses? Maybe if enough people ask for it Nikon will eventually make it...

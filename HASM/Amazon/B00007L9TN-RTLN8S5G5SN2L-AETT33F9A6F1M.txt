Title: perpetuated junk
Content:
I have this model and it is HUGE and expensive. great heat but I prefer the tiny one I WAS FORCED to replace with this monster much BETTER. 
I prefer QUARTZ heaters since they first came out. They heat 'objects' meaning YOU and not just the air around you like ceramnic and radiant. Bravo for the technology but SHAME on the companies that are preventing replacement parts from being sold. Yes, I realize most people are not real bright but why cant I purchase replacement tubes even at places like appliance repair joints when I can buy parts for HEAD CRUSHING appliances and the like? A stove can burst into flames and even explode a house but no problem getting parts for that!!! Ditto for halogen lamps but good luck buying a NEW one of those in case you hadn't noticed.....
This unit uses the EXACT SAME tubes as in a 15yr old PRONTO heater of mine thatis 1/3 the size and horizontal (preferred). So yea, for 15 years at least I have been trying to find replacement tubes. 
So sad that the entire internet cannot give a proper answer to this unavailability issue. They would rather fill the landfills with these ENORMOUS heaters than sell us a couple of replacement parts. They are lucky I gave them one star. That is for the shear SIZE of this unit or maybe for the thermostat that does not work and never did. Matter of fact, I've yet to see ONE heater that has a working thermostat that actually cycles on and off. Inside industry joke I'm sure...My recommendation? move south if you can afford it.

Title: No problems, runs fast!
Content:
Great laptop with the Core i5 processor. It runs fast, easy to set up, great wide-screen view.  Keyboard is much nicer and easier to use than my old Dell Vostro business laptop.  A keeper at a great price, comparable well-known brand name is 200+ more.  
I haven't tested the battery life yet as it is a desktop replacement and will be hardwired.

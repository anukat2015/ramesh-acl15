Title: Amazing product! Been using for about 2 years
Content:
I am absolutely shocked at the bad reviews for this product. I have had this and use it constantly for about 2 years. When I first got this, one of my kids accidentally cracked the screen, I called Sandisk customer support and they sent me a new one, which I received in 3 days. Then I had a problem with it and called customer support again, I had to update the firmware, which they talked me through. THEN my player was sitting in water for a couple of hours, the back of it was soaked. It STILL WORKED!, and is still working as well as when I received it. Yesterday I had the same problem with the firmware, which I called customer support for again, and they walked me through it. If your player just stops working call 1-866-SANDISK, they are wonderful. I love the way the sansa works, it is very easy to use. I just ordered the sansa view 16 GB mp3 player and I am going to give my son the Sansa e270. You can get it for about $170 which is a great price for 16 GB. I can't wait! There is a vehicle charger available for the Sansa e270. It is $29.95. Just search for it on Amazon. Amazing product, I have had absolutely no unresolvable problems with it or with customer support! 5 stars for sure. Love it! 2 years and still going strong. I feel like it will work forever! GREAT product!

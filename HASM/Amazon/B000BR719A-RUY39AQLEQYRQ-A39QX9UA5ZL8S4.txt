Title: Design could be better
Content:
We received this as a gift, and have been using it for two weeks.  So far, it hasn't conked out on us as have the coffee makers described by the other two reviewers, but ours is still relatively new.
Still, there are some design glitches that are steps backward from our 10-year-old Mr. Coffee that this unit replaces.  (As the old machine still works, I believe we will store it for awhile in case this one dies.)  Here is what I've noticed so far:
-The carafe has a substantial inside lip.  It must be turned completely upside down to empty, which is awkward.
-The top of the coffee maker is a lid within a lid.  The smaller lid, towards the back of the top, is what you lift to pour water in.  The larger lid is what you lift in order to pull out the filter basket.  Every time you lift the larger lid, water drips down around the back edge of the coffee maker.  You must wipe the back of the coffee maker and the counter top, every time you access the filter basket.
-This unit comes with a charcoal filter, which is supposed to filter out chlorine from the water.  But the tabs on the filter holder are too short; instead of resting on the edge of the plastic coffee filter basket, the charcoal filter rests instead on the edges of the flimsy paper filter.  (The instructions recommend you use a permanent filter, which I don't like because they let through coffee sediment.)  The first time this thing causes the paper filter to collapse and allows coffee grounds into the brewed coffee, the charcoal filter is going in the trash.
-The charcoal filter also drips water slower than the coffee maker drips water into it; water fills the top of the charcoal filter and then drips over the edges into the coffee grounds, thus negating at least some of the supposed benefit of the charcoal filter.
-This coffee maker has a big footprint, taking up more space on our counter than did our old programmable 12-cup Mr. Coffee.
-Confusing buttons.  To turn on the coffeemaker, you touch "Select."  To turn it off, you touch "Select" again.  This could be a benefit if you want to insure that no one other than a trained individual uses the coffee maker.
-It beeps five times when brewing is complete.  If you are hoping to make a pot of coffee without waking up anyone else nearby, this is not the coffee maker for you.

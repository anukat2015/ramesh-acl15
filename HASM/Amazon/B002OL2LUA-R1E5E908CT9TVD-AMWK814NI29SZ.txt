Title: Large screen
Content:
This is a large machine.  Do not expect to carry this laptop around.  I carry it from my home to our vacation place on weekends, but it is just too large to lug places--that being said, I wish a 21" or 23" machine was available.  It has an outstanding screen and I have completely replaced my desktop with it.  Battery life is short because of the large screen. The battery  lasts just long enough on a full charge for my kids to watch a movie on the dvd player.  This isn't an issue for me, but it might be for others.  It compares very well to the 18" HP.  My old machine was the 17.3" HP and this machine is a bit nicer--faster, clearer screen, larger screen, more memory, but it is a year newer.

Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I bought this vacuum to replace my upright Eureka, which was driving me crazy due to its noise. In addition, you cannot go under the bed without removing the mattresses. Finally, I could not turn off the brush when going over the bare floor, which resulted in scattering the small rocks from shoes all over the place.
All problems are gone now. The Panasonic is very quiet. Cannot directly compare to Electrolux Harmony (I tried it in store with higher background noise), but seems to be very close. It's not like you can vacuum in the same room with a sleeping person, but you can safely do it in the nearby room with a shut door.
The brush is 100% identical to the brush on the Kenmore vacuums (made by Panasonic). However, the design of the vacuum itself is very different. No large ugly wheels (while still rolling fine on high carpet). The canister looks like a droplet, very cute. The white color is more like light grey.
The vacuum comes with only one bag, so stock up on extra ones. They are relatively small. However, due to the OptiFlow design, it sucks the air from all sides of the bag, allowing it to fill up completely without losing suction. And the suction is great! There is also a HEPA filter in the vacuum, which IS included, unlike with other higher-priced brands.
The only gripe I have is I wish it had a handle on top, not front, to pull it while vacuuming (like Electroluxes have).
Other than that, no problems. Love it.

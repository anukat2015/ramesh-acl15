Title: Perfect for those with small rooms and no small children
Content:
I bought this heater to supplement my home's central heatting system. I have several small rooms, so I bought 2 of these. It has 3 fan speed settings:Fan only, lo heat, high heat. It is tiny, so it fits nearly anywhere you would need it. Yet, it puts out a large amount of heat, so it can warm you up quickly. It has a thermostat, so it will turn on and off to regulate temperature. It is not meant to be used in a bathroom because it's not waterproof. Ironically, it works best in a bathroom. I put one in there, and make sure it doesn't get wet. The thermostat works fine, but only in a room small enough for the heater to shut off after the desired temperature is reached. It took 8 hours to heat the bathroom from 64 to 70 degrees and shut itself off. In even a small room, the heater will seemingly never put off enough heat to have the thermostat function correctly. In small rooms it works great as a directional heater, throwing a good amount of heat 5-6 feet away. It's fairly quiet considering it uses a fan, but unless you're a fairly heavy sleeper, I wouldn't use it in a bedroom. There is also no stand, so I had to put it on my own stand to warm my upper body, although it's small size makes it ideal for under the desk. My biggest concern, is it's lack of a shut-off switch should it over-turn. It has an over-heat shut-off, but if you have pets or small children who could knock this over, I would look elsewhere. The front panel doesn't get very hot, but it gets hot enough that I would be very concerned that it doesn't shut-off if turned over. Since I have no pets or small children, it works perfect for my needs, and I recommend this heater.

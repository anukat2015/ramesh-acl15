Title: decent, a tad noisy, good heater
Content:
When I first bought this, I thot it was about the hottest heater I had bought, but after using it and comparing it to others, its about the same as a ceramic heater but is louder, nothing real bad, unless its for your bedroom and your trying to sleep.
Heat is produced from two long Quartz rods that go all the way down the unit, the rods heat up and turn orange, neat concept.  
Good heater, but for the money, I'd buy a ceramic heater or a radiator heater.

Title: Just Got It (12/2008)
Content:
I've moved up from my old Sony Cybershot to the Canon XS - and i'm very pleased with my purchase. I like how it fits in my hand, and the features are incredible - i just can't wait until it warms up so i can take some nice landscape pictures!
Overall it's a good camera, but i'm going to have to buy additional lenses - want some extra zoom and maybe a macro too.

Title: Excellent for the price
Content:
I have been using the Mr. Coffee Espresso machine and coffeemaker for just over a month now and have had absolutely no problems with it. My past experience with Mr. Coffee has been that the plastic handle tends to break or come loose after a while. This particular design seems to be slightly better, though time will tell...
The only issue I had with it was the extremely short wire used to plug into an electrical outlet (12"-18" only). It has intentionally been designed that way as a security feature but I would have preferred another foot of wire length.
Overall I'm very satisfied.

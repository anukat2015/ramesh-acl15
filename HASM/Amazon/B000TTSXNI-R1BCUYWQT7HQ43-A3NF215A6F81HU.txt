Title: Very efficient product
Content:
Just bought the Lasko 751320 Ceramic Tower Heater and am thrilled with all it features and its quietness. The remote control and many programmable settings guarantee a room that is as warm as you want it,  that you are able to sustain or decrease the temperature, that the heater turns off automatically, and that you don't have to climb out of bed to turn it off!!! Great product and great price. L. Nicholson

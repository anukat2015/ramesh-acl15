Title: AF Illuminator??? Read Warranty.....
Content:
additional Info FYI
Hi guys just wanted to share this with you..........
About a week ago I was taking some nature photograph's ...It was a hot day here in Miami and I was sweating quite a bit. After about 30-40 shots the lcd turned orange then green then the camera died. I sent it to the service center in Laredo TX, They told me there was corrosion on one of the boards and it was'nt covered by the warranty.
Wow...was I dissapointed , They gave me the option to repair it for $350.00 or trade it in for a new camera ....I opted to upgrade to the A300 for $347.00 (Duh!) . 
My point ....These cameras should be able to withstand some drops of sweat...we do take photos in the heat.....so take extra care of yours ...unless u want to upgrade to the A300 Hahahah. Another expensive lesson for me..........
I'm looking forward to the A300 it should be arriving by early next week. hopefully the live view will minimize sticking my face on the camera while sweating........hahaha. Hope to post more photos soon...
If I hadnt bought so many accessories and lenses for the sony i wouldve gone another direction.....
I agree it's a great camera for its price. I sold my D40 to buy the A200.
Great sharp shots in daylight. One thing bugs me .....The AF illuminator does'nt work well in dim light. I was actually looking for the AF illuminator on this and could'nt find one. I did some research and one site said it's built in w /the flash....Does'nt work too well as far as i'm concerned ....The AF goes loco in really dim conditions. This is one thing sony should improve on. 
.......follow up... i just received my HVL-F36AM flash by Sony and the AF Assist on the external flash works much much better...I reccomend u get one if you're planning to  take a lot of shots in dim lighting....

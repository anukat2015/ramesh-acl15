Title: A room warmer not a heater
Content:
I had hoped this panel would help maintain a comfortable temperature in a small bedroom, but it doesn't generate quite enough heat.  On the plus side, because it doesn't get very hot, it seems unlikely to cause a fire or injury if something, or someone, got too close!  Also, it is apparently very important to hang it exactly level to avoid breakage - I would prefer something less fragile.  However, it's better than nothing...

Title: Great for small offices too!
Content:
I've had this brewer at my office for THREE YEARS.  We probably run between 4 and 12 cups a day, 6 days a week.  I can say, without a doubt, this has been a fantastic machine!  Everyone gets a fresh cup of whatever they want.  We use the pods for Coffee (dark roast, light roast, flavored, and decaf), standard tea bags for tea (they work just fine and are much cheaper), we even run straight hot water for hot chocolate and apple cider.  No more stale coffee, no more burnt coffee, no more wasted coffee!  Is it the best coffee in the world, NO...but it's okay.  The pods are indeed expensive, but for me, the flexibility more than makes up for the extra expense.

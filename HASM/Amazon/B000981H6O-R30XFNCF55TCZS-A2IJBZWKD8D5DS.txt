Title: It's Not Great
Content:
I've owned this vacuum about 5 weeks.  It's very average in my opinion, mainly because the suction power just isn't strong enough.  You notice this particularly when you're using it to vacuum your car and the dirt and debris is somewhat ingrained in the shorter carpet.  Just seems like you have to go over it several times to get all the dirt.  It does work well on spills though (the wet vac part), and it does an okay job vacuuming stairs and other small jobs.  Overall, I'd give it a very average rating.

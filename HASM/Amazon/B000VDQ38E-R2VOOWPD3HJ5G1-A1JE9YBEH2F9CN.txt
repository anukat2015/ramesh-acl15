Title: Hope this fixes the problem
Content:
I have owned this vacuum for less than one month and now I am using my old Hoover vac until I find out what the problem is. It worked great for the first few weeks and now the roller brush will not spin. I guess I need a new belt already!!! I can't beleieve that the belt could be worned out so soon but once I try that I will see how it works.

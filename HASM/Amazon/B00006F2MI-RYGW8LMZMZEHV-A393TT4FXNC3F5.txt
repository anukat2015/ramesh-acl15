Title: Yet another piece of overpriced techno-junk - 0 stars!
Content:
Most of the reviewers of this piece of garbage have got it dead on. Mine is dead after less than 2 years of headaches. It finally belched smoke out the back & now I can burden our local landfill with its carcass. I have had every problem that the other reviewers are complaining about. I didn't mind cleaning the entire thing every morning. I didn't mind running vinegar through it & changing the filter so it actually functioned. I did mind getting 10 cups of coffee spewed all over my kitchen when the basket malfunctioned, I did mind the  weak coffee & the need to stuff every last bean into the grinder so it made merely a half-crappy cup, and I did mind the cheaply made basket door which popped out or got stuck in. Misuse my a**, this is simply a crappy, overpriced gimmicky coffeemaker. And if you had to get warranty service, why do you love this coffeemaker so much? I had a Black & Decker that still worked perfectly when I gave it to my daughter after about 7 years of faithful service. I thought heck, I will never need it again, I have a brand new gimmicky whiz-bang grind your own whoo-hoo fru-fru coffeemaker! Boy was I wrong. Thanks Cuisinart, your products are garbage & I will never, ever buy another one, as long as I live, so help me God, etc. etc.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I've got to say that when I read the reviews on this product, I was excited about buying one.  I own a 250 lb Mastiff, a cocker spaniel, and 4 cats (two of which are long-haired).  Needless to say, any vacuum I buy gets put to the ultimate test! I usually don't put too much value to a few bad comments on products when the overall review is good.  However, this time I should have.  Other than the "great" suction power, I can't find any other positive for this vacuum.  The rubberized attachments are a joke.  When you try to empty the container, the debris caught in the upper chamber around the filter sprinkles down all over the place so you have to clean it up again.  I had used the machine less than 10 minutes when it tripped my breaker (nothing else was in use).  And, lastly, it is so loud that I'm sure it has to affect a person's hearing!  I had this machine 1 day and took it back!  I really wanted to like this product.  The Hoover Healthy Home is a much better product.

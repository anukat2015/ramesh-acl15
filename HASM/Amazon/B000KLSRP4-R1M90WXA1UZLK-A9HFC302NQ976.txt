Title: This is awesome
Content:
I work from home and have a small server room next to my study. It get extremely warm especially during the summer and the central A/C can seem to handle the heat output of the various devices. So I decided to follow advice I got from a buddy about getting additional cooling power with this Whynter portable air conditioner. First impressions was that it had a nice appeal to it with the stainless steel and "desktop" like shape. It read over the manual briefly and proceeded to get it going. Everything was fairly straightforward. My thermostat showed about 82F just before using the unit and after turning it on it climbed to about 83F for a few minutes before steadily dropping a couple of degrees ever 5-10 mins. All in all it took about 30 mins to get the area down to about 68F. The overal area of the study is about 120 Sqft, but I left the door to my server room open which added about 100Sqft of open area. The temp. in the server room was about 70F which was just fine. I've been running it about 6-8 hrs a day and the one little complaint is that it gets kinda loud when the compressor activates and the fan is on high. I otherwise extremely satisfied with this item. By the way, the remote is a real help, but keep it in a safe place cos it's quite small and easy to misplace.

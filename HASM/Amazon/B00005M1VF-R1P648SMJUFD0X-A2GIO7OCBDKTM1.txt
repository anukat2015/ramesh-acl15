Title: This thing is great!
Content:
OK, I admit, I did not buy it for myself - my husband bought it for me and it sat for a long time before I used it.  But when I figured the thing out I LOVED it!  I am so sorry for all of you that lost your coffee maker after just a few uses.  I am also sorry it does not fit your "cleaning" requirements.  I am very sorry for all of you that had the "coffee explosion."  Mine has worked twice a day for a couple of years now with only one coffee explosion and no other problems.  I am going to order another one so when my little coffee maker does finally give it up I will have a replacement.

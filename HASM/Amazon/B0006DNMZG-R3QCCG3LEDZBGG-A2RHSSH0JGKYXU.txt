Title: don't waste ur money on it
Content:
had it less than 2 months and now it's dead :(
I won't even bother to send it back to the menufacturer, costs time and delivery fees. It's true that this heater generates good amount of heat, but it emitts unpleasant plastic smell as well. I'm gonna pay over 50 dollars on a better heater!~

Title: Endless hours of frustration
Content:
The software is so klugy and then stops syncing all together. Endless hours of troubleshooting. Don't take my word for it: go on-line to the Zune user's groups and read the hundreds of posts by frustrated owners who have tried to find ways to get their Zune to be recognized or sync. Forget Microsoft tech support. Another worthless exercise in frustration. My advice: Stay away from Zune.

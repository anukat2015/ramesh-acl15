Title: Works fine...for a little while then rollers stop rolling...eventually entire machine died
Content:
I was excited to use the vacuum and for the first 3-months worked great!  A lot of suction on rugs and carpet, then I noticed that the rollers were not working and for some reason the height adustment seemed broken.  I could not find anything to fix and instead had to settle for using the vacuum in one setting.  After 6-months the vacuum just stopped. All filters had been cleaned after each use, so blockage was not an issue. A waste of money for a product that lasted less than a year. Disappointing indeed.

Title: pretty pleased with this purchase...
Content:
This a/c unit works pretty well. I'm in a space about 13' by 35' which is almost twice the size that this was designed to cool. I dont have much to base this review off of being that this is my first portable a/c (beats using a fan hands down). Other than it taking about 10-15 mins for the cooling element to disperse the coolest air emitted, it works as indicated.I havent had much time to play with the programming features or heater. This was a quick pick-up at home depot for $600. If anyone has any input or a better portable model to recommend in the same general price range, please do so. thanks

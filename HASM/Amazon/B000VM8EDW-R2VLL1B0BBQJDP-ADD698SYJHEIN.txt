Title: don't do it.
Content:
I purchased the Sansa View mainly because of the 16 GB capacity, and found the operation to be rather confusing. The instruction "manual" is no help whatsoever, so I was left to fend for myself.  It took me an entire day to figure out how to turn the infernal thing off, and after the player froze on me, I decided that this was cutting edge technology that hadn't yet cut out all the blips.  I returned it, and  I'm much happier with the more compact Sandisk e280.

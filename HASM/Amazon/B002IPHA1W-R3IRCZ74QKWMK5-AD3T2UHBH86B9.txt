Title: Excellent MP3 Player with...VERY VERY VERY SLOOOOOW FAST FORWARD/REVERSE
Content:
I agree with the positive reviews about this walkman but....... I listen to a good deal of spoken word mp3s for self improvement and educational purposes. Often I have to rewind/fast forward to replay a passage and have found that this is far far too slow. Often the tracks I play are over 8 mins long and it takes forever to get to a particular point in the track. On most electronics if you press and hold the fast forward or reverse buttons the speed accelerates the longer you hold the button down. NOT THIS ONE. SLOW SLOW SLOW. Very frustrating!!

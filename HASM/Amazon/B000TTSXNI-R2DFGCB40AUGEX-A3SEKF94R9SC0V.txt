Title: Good space heater - If you are looking for a room heater, look elsewhere!
Content:
I was excited to pickup this product after a large % of good reviews at Amazon; Here is my take on this:
+ Good thermostat control - although it the filament most likely measures the temperature of the blades and not the surrounding air - so you can imagine a slight delay...
+ Fairly good swivel action and angle
+ Can really feel the warmth at close proximity - doesn't work very well if you are sleeping
+ Timer feature works well
- Don't think its effective as a room heater - Perhaps because the previous winter was exceptionally cold or maybe my expectations were too high; but this just couldn't keep up with the cold.
- If you use it through the night, you will wake up feeling extremely dry in your throat - probably the case with most ceramic heaters - kills all moisture in the air
The verdict! - Fair heater for the price, with decent set of features; But if you are looking for an alternative to your old (and power hungry) room heating, look elsewhere - A bigger model perhaps..

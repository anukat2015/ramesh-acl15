Title: Very happy with purchase for home
Content:
Bought this laptop on Black Friday.  Works great, easy setup.  Battery life is good-to-great.  15.5" is a good screen size -- almost considered 17.5" until saw it and realized it's a huge monster that would never work on an airplane.  Hard drive is sufficient size.  Really like the HDMI port to watch DVDs or Internet video on our flatscreen TV.  Seems to be one of the best laptops on the market today.  Wish the ctrl and fcn keys were switched and there was a clearer indicator that the NUM Lock and CAPS Lock are on/off.

Title: Best of the Best.
Content:
Greetings to all;
 I am not a professional photographer, just an amateur with enough economical means to support my photography hobby. I just received this machine, it is simply fantastic. I wanted to upgrade my Digital Rebel XT (which by the way has been a loyal friend) and I decided to go with the 40D since I think the 5D is a bit over priced for my needs. In any rate, the machine has a great LCD screen, the controls and menus are easy to find and use and if you are familiar with Canon products it will not be all that hard to figure the machine out since controls are very similar in nature to the rest of the Canon products. The machine has an immense amount of features that I have not discovered yet but one of the features that I like the most is the "live view" feature which just like a point and shoot lets you preview the shot before you actually shoot it. I would not want to get all technical in this review at this time, there are many technical reviews on this machine already plus I can't consider my self to be savvy enough to be able to technically elaborate on this product, however, if you can afford it, by all means go for it, I am quiet sure you won't regret it, from the way it feels in your hands to the way the shutter sounds after firing off a shot. All and all impressive machine.  I am looking forward to use it for as long as time permits.

Title: Horrible Vac
Content:
My wife decided to buy this vac since we have three dogs.  It has been one of the worst vacuums I have ever owned.  It has absolutely no suction power and requires constant cleaning of the very small debris catcher.  Our [...]Dirt Devil still out performs this one.  If you have kids and dogs this is not the vac for you.  If your retired and have no pets or kids it may be alright.

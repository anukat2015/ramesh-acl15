Title: Amazing desktop replacement
Content:
Fully loaded.  Crystal clear huge 18.4 inch 1920 X 1080 HD LCD backed by NVIDIA's GForce 9600M GT card w/512 ram, Blue Ray DVD ROM, full size keyboard with numeric pad and 64 bit Vista Home Premium OS.  Quick to set up, not too much bloatware.  Runs graphic intensive programs quite well however a cooling tray such as NZXT's Cryo LX would be beneficial.  Not a laptop, somewhat heavy, not something to easily tote from place to place unless you have a rolling case for it.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a desktop replacement with the advantage of being mobile.

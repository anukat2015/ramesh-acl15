Title: LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
Content:
I really did some research before buying a pod coffee maker.  I picked this one for the variety of coffee makers you could get pods from and also the size of the cup you could make.  Most have one small size cup and that it is.  I got it and it works wonderful, the coffee is so fresh and tasty.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Little more expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.
Enjoy,  Nola  :)

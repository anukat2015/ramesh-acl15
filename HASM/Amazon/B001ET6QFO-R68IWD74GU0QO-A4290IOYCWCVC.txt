Title: Not impressed ....
Content:
I bought this camera in February and it's now June and it's already getting sent back for repair. I was in the middle of working a wedding, and I got the dreaded Error 99 and it started making a click-click-click noise that is most likely a bad shutter. And although I'm not as bothered by the softer images that other reviewers mention (I sort of like that look), the softness does bother me when it shows up as lack of focus on the spot where the red dot is placed! I really expected much more out of this camera, and I am very disappointed.

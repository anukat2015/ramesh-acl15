Title: Heater is great!
Content:
Bought one of these little heaters many years ago and loved it then. Moved and gave it to my kids who used it for more years. Just purchased this one and it keeps my little apartment toasty and warm. Don't have to use the big unit furnished with my place at all which makes me crazy with all the air blowing around. Saves a whole bunch in electric. So safe to use, no fear of leaving it on all the time. Guess I just don't have anything bad to say about it.

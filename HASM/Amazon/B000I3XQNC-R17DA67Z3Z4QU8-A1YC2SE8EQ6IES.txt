Title: Best entry level SLR hands down!!!!!!!
Content:
If you're thinking about stepping up from a point and shoot to an SLR get the XTI you wont be sorry. I also recommend picking up the 50mm 1.8 lens since its only $90. I've had mine for 1 month now and I've already took around 600 pics. Make sure you get a fast CF card and around 1GB if you're going to shoot at the highest quality.

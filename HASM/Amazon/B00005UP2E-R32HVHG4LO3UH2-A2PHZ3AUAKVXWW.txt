Title: I'd like to send it to the Devil
Content:
I bought this shoddy vacuum for those hard to reach places around the house. We all have such places, and it's a true shame to watch dust, bug particles and other unwanted detritus accumulate and grow ever unsightlier. So I figured I'd buy one of those old fashioned wand sweepers, similar to the electrolux owned by my parents. Having owned several Dirt Devil products in the past and having been quite pleased with their quality and performance, especially on the pet hair infested carpeted stairs, I decided, in my naivete, to purchase this product. Bad idea. These are all rather old, as is my trusty Kirby, so I was a fresh initiate into this whole "bagless" craze sweeping the vacuum world. A bagless sweeper, it turns out, has a simple plastic catcher in which the dust is stored, a container which, when you open it, spews foul smelling dust into the air and continues to spew as you empty it. Add that to the overall weakness of the motor (I have been compelled to physically place dust into the maw of this machine, finding it rather weak-willed and lethargic) and the awkwardness and poor construction of the plastic wand, and you have yourself a lousy and expensive piece of plastic rubbish. I compare it to my older DD products and weep at the clear decline in quality.

Title: No Heaters Delivered, But I'm Very Satisfied
Content:
Five Stars (* * * * *) - FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
In mid-December I ordered two of these Vornado heaters through Amazon, and received the usual automatic responses, etc.  
The heaters would be provided by a company named Crazy Dave's Tool House.
A shipment from Crazy Dave's arrived timely, when promised - just after Christmas. Good.  But, what we received was not what we ordered.  We were sent two other items instead.  I contacted Amazon.  
Here's what happened:
On January 5, I notified Amazon of the mistake.
On January 6, Amazon sent an automatic response saying they would check.
On January 7, Crazy Dave's sent an apologetic e-mail and a refund notice.
On January 7, Amazon confirmed that the paid amount was fully refunded.
On January 8, my credit card balance showed the refund had been made.
I'm sorry the heaters did not arrive, of course, but I'm very pleased with the quick and satisfying response by both Amazon and the supplier.
I rate this transaction a "neutral" for not receiving the heaters.
I rate this transaction FIVE stars for customer service.

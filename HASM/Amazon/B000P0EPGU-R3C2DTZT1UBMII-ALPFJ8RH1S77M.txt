Title: There's just no heat. None at all.
Content:
The Honeywell HZ-0300 provides "All Season Temperature Control" according to Honeywell. This is true provided that none of your seasons require heat - because there's just no heat. None at all. The unit whirs around and oscillates but the heat never actually kicks on. 
So if you're looking for a large plastic thing that spins around doing nothing, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. If you're looking for heat, you're better off with flint and tinder.

Title: So very pleased!!!
Content:
I had searched high amd low for this product and I just knew the "Black Friday" sales would have it at a great bargin but....NOT. As well as those supose to be "Better than Black Friday" sales many stores were offering. A friend remined me to look on Amazon and low and be hold they had the best deal $183.99 flat. I oreded it 5 days before Christmas and recieved it before Christmas and didnt pay extra for shipping. Thats my kind of shopping. The Ipod arrived just like I got it out of the store and it works great. I am soooo very pleased!!!

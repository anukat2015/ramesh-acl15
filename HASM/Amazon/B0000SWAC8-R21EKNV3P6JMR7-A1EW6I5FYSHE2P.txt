Title: It sucks good
Content:
I love this vacuum. I have two beagles whose only job in life appears to be shedding. I had a persian-style rug that looked all faded and all the fibers were good and smushed. I'd tried everything from standard vacuuming (with my old clunker) to brushing it with the dog brushes and trying to get the fur off with packing tape and I just couldn't get the fur out. One pass with this vacuum and the rug looked like new! The colors were just fine under the layer of fur and this machine took it off like magic!
When the bag is full the light comes on. The suction seems to stay pretty consistently good until the bag is well and truly full, and I appreciate that. Once the bag is full it can't suck up anything, but that's to be expected. The difference in suction power and how quickly it changes actually surprised me, but in a good way. No wasting time with poor suction on a half-full bag.
The only down-side is that it doesn't come with a stair attachment. Trying to use the power head on the stairs is tiring and awkward and no other attachments really do the job right. I don't want anything special or fancy, just a 3" or 4" wide by 1" deep head that would be less awkward than the power head and more efficient than trying to do it with the crevice tool. For the couple of bucks that kind of simple plastic part would have cost them, I'd expect to have it in there. It would have been far more useful (and cheaper to produce) than a dusting brush (does anyone actually use those?).

Title: Saves Your Valuable Equipment
Content:
I camp out all year long. I purchased a Mr Heater Portable Buddy heater to heat my tent/quad trailer this last year. The manufacturer recommended using the filter when using bulk propane tanks to fuel the heater. It worked so well on my heater (no fuel related problems in the last 12 months) that I also installed one on my Coleman two burner stove which I have hooked to a 20 lb tank also. For the small cost, it really saves you a lot of problems with propane contaminents and maintanence costs.

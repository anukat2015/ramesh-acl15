Title: I am amazed
Content:
I have only owned the XTi for a few days now, and wow!  I love this camera so much.  Now, let me give you a little background on myself.  I am not a photographer, nor do I aspire to be.  I just got tired of bad photos coming from my point-and-shoot camera.  My best friend IS a professional photographer, with museum quality photos.  He uses a Rebel XT for the moment. (He's waiting for the price to come down on the 1D Mk3)  Anyways, the quality of the photos I take now is great.  After a few lessons in what an f-stop is and exposure and shutter speeds I have the basics down.  I also am pretty good at editing in Adobe CS.  (HIGHLY recommended for editing, even for amateurs.)  I only shoot in RAW format so as to achieve the best quality.  
For anyone out there who is looking for a replacement for their point and shoot, and wants something upgradeable (ie lenses) this is the best buy out there right now.  With the introduction of the XSi the price has come down a bit.  
Like I said, I'm not a photographer, just someone that wants to take good photos.  And I give this a very solid 5 stars!!!

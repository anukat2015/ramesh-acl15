Title: Runs World of Warcraft, battery life is a bear..
Content:
I bought this computer in silver with the white keys, they seem to show up better than the models with black keys even in low light.  This computer runs fast and can do everything that I expect from my desktop.  I am a gamer and like to play World of Warcraft.  Didn't want to spend the big bucks for a gaming laptop and was willing to bypass a machine that could handle 3d graphics and just use the laptop for email and internet surfing.  Well to my surprise this computer plays W.O.W. as good as my desktop, maybe better.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the battery life with gamer programs is about an hour and 45 min... yuck.  I had to buy an extended life battery for about $190. (Sony VAIO VGP-BPL13 Extended Battery) I went from having about 1.75 hrs to about 4.5 with the extended life batery doing extensive 3-D graphics and bigtime battery drain. So wondering if I might have been better buying something $200-300 more expensive with longer battery life. But at this point I am still thinking I am ahead with the price. Now at least I have the extended and a back up battery. If you are a serious gamer maybe an ASUS with the 15 hour advertised battery life and game tweeked graphics card might be a better choice?

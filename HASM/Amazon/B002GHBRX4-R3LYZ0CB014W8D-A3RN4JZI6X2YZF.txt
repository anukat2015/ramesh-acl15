Title: AWESOME!!!!
Content:
I received this Vacuum about a month ago.  This is the first canister vacuum I have ever owned.  The suction works great on carpet and my hard wood floor as well. It does not kick dust and debri back out like my old vacuum did.   It fits nicely under my couches, beds, and dining room table.  I love that you can adjust the level of suction so you can use it on different throw rugs in the house.  The dirt trap needs to be emptied often.  I carry a plastic bag with me and empty when needed.  It helps keep dust down.  The hose detaches easily at the top near handle or at the bottom at the touch of a button with your foot. It is not loud either.   Overall I am very happy with this vacuum.  I am glad I purchased after reading tons of other reviews on other vacuums.

Title: Does a very good job
Content:
I've had my triple Mr. Heater for one full winter (0 to 30 degree nights/days in Kansas).  It does a nice job of heating my two-car garage, even with the double wide door being opened periodically.  My only complaints are that one of the burners occasionally goes out (but is easily relit) and it "sings" once in a while as it heats up.  Apparently the difference in metal expansion as the three burners are lit individually and warm up at a slightly different rate, causes some kind of harmonic and it "sings" until everything has warmed up completely.  No big deal.  If ya wanna get warm fast, this is the heater for you.

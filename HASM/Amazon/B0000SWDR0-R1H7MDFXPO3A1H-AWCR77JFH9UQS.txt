Title: Even the kids love it
Content:
I bought this vacuum two years ago to augment a couple of Electrolux Model G's (USA made--vintage 1961--with all attachments including the Paint Sprayer).  I purchased it afer surveying the offerings from Aerus, Dyson and the rest.
It has performed well beyond my expectations.  It is quiet--until you turn on the Made in China power nozzle.  It cleans every surface in my house well and with ease.  It has a little rack on the back of the tank to carry the attachments, which include this nifty little air-driven mini power head, perfect for cleaning the mats in the car.  The tank is very light so you can move from room to room without straining your back.  The cord reel is very effective, it hasn't bound up in my two years of use.
The power level is variable both on the tank and on the hose, so you won't suck up the kitchen throw rugs when you sweep them.  The power head feels a little cheap, but it's easy to disassemble for cleaning and belt replacement.  The light on the power head is lame, unless you like vacuuming in the dark.  And strangely, the head only swivels to the right.
Most importantly, even though I do 90 percent of the cleaning around here, my wife and kids love it.
I just finished vacuuming the entire house with my 1 year old in hot pursuit of this very nicely painted tank.  I find myself using my Model Gs less and less.  In fact, one has been relegated to Garage duty.
It's not a perfect replacement for the venerable Electrolux's of old.  But then what is?  Certainly not the newer offerings from the former Electrolux, whose salesmen should spend more time selling and less time posting bogus reviews on the internet.

Title: Great camera and all-around lens
Content:
I have only had this camera for a little more than a month but this camera has proven to be great camera. Being my first real dSLR I thought that I would have a steep learning curve but this model is not that complicated. It has all the features I was looking for. I choose the 28-135mm lens with I think is a good lens for most situations. I'm also using the macro feature of the lens a lot more than I thoght I would.

Title: Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB
Content:
This is exactly what I thought it would turn out. The Sleek Photo is much easier to use in transfering songs from the computer onto the player. Everyone told me to get the ipod, but this is clearly better. The software is so easy to use and the sound quality rocks! Only glitch is that sometimes after you transfer songs and take the sync cable out, the mp3 freezes and you just have to restart it. Thats about it.

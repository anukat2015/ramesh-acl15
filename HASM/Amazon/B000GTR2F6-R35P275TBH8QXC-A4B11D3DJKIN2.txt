Title: The best coffee maker ever!
Content:
I won't go on and on about how great this machine is, but you will not be disappointed. If you share my lack of enthusiasm to make coffee in the morning and just can't get it right, this machine is for you. Even if you can make coffee, you will truly appreciate this machine. I fell in love with the vending version years ago and bought the first model that Keurig put out. When I moved to the east coast for contract work, I bought this model for my house here. You might think the kcups are a little pricey but I still think it is a machine that just cannot be rivaled with other 'pod' or one cup dispensing machines.

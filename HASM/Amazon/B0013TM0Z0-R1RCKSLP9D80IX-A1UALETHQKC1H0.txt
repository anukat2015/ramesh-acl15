Title: Your going to be sorry................
Content:
Just installed one of these in my John Deere Tractor cab, and am pretty disapointed. I have seen these advertised as both 300 Watts and now Amazon is listing them as only 180 watts???? So am not sure if there is two models of this or not??? I bought it because of the review on here from the guy with the skid steer praising it??? I found mine will take 20 mins to defrost[about a foot square hole NOT the whole thing] the windshield if its ZERO degrees here in Northern Maine. I dont really know what it would be good for???? I would say it would be something that would heat up an area maybe 18"X18" square not the cab of a tractor, that is more like 4ft square. If you think it will heat up a vehicle anything like the vehicle heater, you are going to be very disapointed. As it's output is about 1/10th of that.............. I would not have bought it if I could have pluged one in before I bought!!!  Maybe a better way of rating it is that a standard hairdryer[1500wt] will put out atleast &lt;&lt;&lt;5>>> times what this does; if you have a 300watt version; the 180watt version, they are selling now, would only put out &lt;&lt;&lt;8X less>>> than a hairdryer. So if you think about how long it would take to heat up the vehicle with a standard hairdryer and then assume it will take 8X longer you can see it is going to take a very LONG TIME!

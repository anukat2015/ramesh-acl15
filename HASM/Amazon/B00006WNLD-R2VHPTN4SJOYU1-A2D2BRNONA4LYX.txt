Title: Perfect for One
Content:
We have a regular coffee maker for my husband and he drinks regular coffee.  I need to drink decaf and only want one cup in the morning, so this is perfect for me.  (it brews fast too)  I don't know how long it will last, but if I get a year or so out of it it's worth it.

Title: Great camera, handles like a super fast film SLR
Content:
Best camera I have ever owned, and I have owned many. 12 MP is plenty, and you get absolutely oustanding pictures with great resolution. When teamed up with fast, high quality FX lenses, pro results are possible. The attached flash is almost unnecessary, since with the high ISOs you can just about take pictures in the dark.

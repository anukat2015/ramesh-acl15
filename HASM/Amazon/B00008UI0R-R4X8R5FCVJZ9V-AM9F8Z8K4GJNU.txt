Title: The good and the bad
Content:
Hoover Wind Tunnel S3765
I've just finished using it for the 3rd time, so my opinion is not based on the `fresh-out-of-the-box glow.
Positive observations:
	m	The main attachment's revolving brush is electronically powered, which makes it superior to those that are suction-powered.  Though, it also comes with a smaller suction-powered tool.  (I understand, however, that not all models include this suction-powered tool.)
	m	Has 3 different power settings, which is useful for various surfaces.
	m	Design is quite simple and logical.
Negative observations:
	m	The hose connexion does not revolve, which inevitably necessitates the occasional pause to untwist.
	m	The crevice tool is made of a black plastic that rubs off on walls and other surfaces.  Great for those who happen to have black walls.  For the other 99.9% of us, not so great.

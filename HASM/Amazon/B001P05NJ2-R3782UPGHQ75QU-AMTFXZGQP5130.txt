Title: Buy direct from Apple
Content:
The product is great. For both work (software development) and play (World of Warcraft) this machine suits me just fine. 
However, if you have an Apple store handy, I recommend you buy there instead. From the first time I turned on the laptop, the dvd drive made a loud noise every time I turned it on or woke it up from sleep. I took it to the nearest Apple Genius bar and they agreed it was wrong, and offered to trade in for a brand new one. Then they found out I bought from Amazon, so they couldn't do that. Instead I had to mail my laptop to AppleCare and wait for them to say there was nothing wrong, and then send it back fixed(!). Weirdness of AppleCare aside, I could have started using my laptop a week earlier if I'd bought it from Apple.

Title: Good while it lasted
Content:
This little space heater was good while it lasted.  It warmed up my little bathroom in the spring.  It wasn't hot to the touch so it lived up to it's name: SafeHeat.  However, the thing died after a mere 5 months.  I tried unplugging it for a day and switching it on again but it refuses to work at all.  While the product wasn't crazy expensive, it's still a waste of $15.  It's not worth the cost of shipping it back.  I will not buy this product again.

Title: Soleus Air heater review
Content:
Very nice heater.  Like the ability to raise and lower, and left to right feature, plus option to use 400 watt or 800 watt feature.  It's great to use while working at the computer.  My husband likes to use it, too.  Great for doing a "far infrared mini sauna" treatment.  (I have Lyme disease, and use it for detox, too.)  The only shortcoming I find with the machine is the mounting of the heater head is a bit clunky.  It's a bit difficult to tilt the dish up and down.  But otherwise, it's a great little heater, and works wonderfully, especially if you use it while sitting on a chair.

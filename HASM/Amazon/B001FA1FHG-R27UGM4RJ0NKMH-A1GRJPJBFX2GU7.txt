Title: Take the chill out!
Content:
I bought 2 of these around christmas time. One for me and one for a gift. The shipping was free and came in a timely manner. when I recieved them they both had specks inside the glass. I assume it was fragments from the fake log. That rattled loose during shipping. Never the less you can't get them out. Now there is slight discoloration under the glass on the red back ground. Also make sure you use the short screws to attach the base. The directions make it look like you use the long ones. If you hang it on the wall. It's a pain to take it down, and then attach it to the base. So i'ts really one or the other. As far as being a good heater it is. When i'ts in the teens it helps the furnace from coming on every 10 minutes! I've used it every day for a month now and my electric bill has went up 50.00. So if I would have turned up my furnace to stay that warm. My gas bill would have been alot more than that! So for sure buy one! They give off good heat, and the ambiance is cool too!  Also turn off the fake log crackle.It annoys everyone.You will enjoy the ambiance alot more!

Title: Just average
Content:
I bought the Eureka 3684F for one reason.  It has an extra long hose and can be extended.  It is also very light so one can get up on a ladder with the vacuum and clean pot shelves and high places that you cannot reach with any other vacuum. For this reason, I would rate it excellent.
I only gave it 3 stars for the following reasons. It is very basis.  No bells and whistles here.  It has a pretty flimsy hose.  The cord is very long which is good but you have to wrap it on the vacuum when you put it away and I think this is a nuisance,  I also think that one should be able to turn it on at the hose.  Would I buy it again?  Yes I would, as it serves it purpose. 
The service from Amazon was excellent as usual.  It arrived in just a couple of days after placing the order and it shipped free.

Title: Save Your Money!
Content:
I read the reviews but am extremely disappointed. It is so light weight
that my carpet does not look or feel clean when I vacuum. It sounds
mighty but it is not! The pet attachment worked twice and then would not
rotate no matter what I did to it! I am back in the market for a good vacuum. I am
giving this one away.

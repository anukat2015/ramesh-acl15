Title: An okay heater/stove
Content:
I bought this because I wanted a larger stove heater.  I already have a Dimplex Electralog--the compact version.  
I have to say that although this one is bigger and way heavier than the Dimplex, it doesn't put out as much heat.  I like that it has a thermostat, though.  
I probably wouldn't buy this again, but also don't have any issues with it.  The package it came in was pretty beat up, though.  The styrofoam packaging kept the stove itself safe.

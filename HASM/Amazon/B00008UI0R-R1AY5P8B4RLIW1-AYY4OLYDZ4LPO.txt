Title: Hoover S3765-040 bagless canister - Serious Suction
Content:
I was very happy with the price and quick and easy delivery on my Hoover.  It performs great.  The suction is unbelievable.  The only problem I have with it is that it gets stuck up a lot.  If something a little unusual gets lodged in the pipe it continues to suck until the pipe hole is clogged and you really can't tell it is plugged until the last minute when you finally discover there's a problem.
Otherwise it is light and simple.  It does an amazing job.
I think it is a great product.

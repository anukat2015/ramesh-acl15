Title: the REAL ipod and ZUNe KILLA..................
Content:
- Option of an FM tuner
 
- Built in Microphone
 
- Feels more sturdy than the iPod.. the comfort of knowing you have a grip on your mp3 player
- Works with Windows Media Player
 
- Navigating thru the player is easy for Windows users 
- plays almost all standard file formats inclusing wma and wmv 
all these spell a better product and it only tells us to expect better products from creative. my only issue is since i purchased it for my birthday in october if froze on my 4 times already. it does not loose any save songs but it is anoying.besides that it is still better than both products. that is my only reson for giving it 4 stars out of 5.
 waiting to see what microsoft comes out with next maybe i will buy a 3rd gen zune if it is improved.

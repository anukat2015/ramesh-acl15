Title: Very dissatisfied
Content:
I would not recommend this product. Due the fact,that the write up and product information is not totally correct. Deerso, the seller of this product, after several attempts has yet to return any correspondence that I have tried with them. when contacting World Marketing the distributor they explained to me that The operating pressures stated are not correct. I then had to purchase a second regulator to handle the increased pressure. I then had to pay a second service call charge to have it installed and adjust.   THIS PRODUCT IS NOT REPRESENTED VERY WELL. THE SELLER DEERSO HAS NEVER CONTACTED ME AFTER NUMEROUS TRIES, TO BACK UP THEIR PRODUCT. I FEEL THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SELLING ANYTHING ON AMAZON.

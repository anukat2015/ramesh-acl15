Title: please help
Content:
I am an amatuer. I own the Rebel eos 10.1 xt. I am looking to upgrade to the 12.2 xsi. I have actually purchased it, but it remains unopened. I had mentioned to a pro what i was thinking on doing, and their question to me was why go from an xt to an xsi? I said among other things, for sharper photos, which they said probably wouldn't happen with an xsi. Their suggestion to me was a new lens, with a price tag of $1200. That is not reasonable for me at this time. Am I wasting my money on the xsi? Can anyone help?  Thank you for your input.

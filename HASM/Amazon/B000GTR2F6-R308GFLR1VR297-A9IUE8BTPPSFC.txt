Title: mega convenient
Content:
I never really thought about great coffee convenience, but this is it.  usually great coffee is burdened by grinding, brewing time and equipment- this is not- i wanted hotter coffee than our cuisinart and i got it- it isnt scalding but it is just right and i like hot coffee-dont let it sit for twenty minutes and expect it to be hot still, but you get the point.  Everyone i serve it to is amazed how simple and quick- i get to be the perfect host since i can get a decaf for so and so, a tea for whomever, and a strong one for uncle joe.  my husband and i share different tastes and this suits us perfectly.  a caveat- k cups/coffee not in supermarkets where i am from so on line ordering is a must- and storage is best accommodated by sacrificing a cabinet entirely (well, since i got just about every kind under the sun).  Coffee people brand and green mountain rival starbucks- which makes me very happy- so far i have not returned to starbucks brand and i pass tim hortons ( which i was starting to anyway with starbucks elevated taste buds) now cause i know i get the perfect cup at home.

Title: Great Camera for the Price
Content:
I paid $480 for the D40 with an 18-55mm kit lens.  For the price, this is a great DSLR ample storage, battery life, and speed.  However the kit lens is very basic and doesn't have vibration reduction.  I will need to add better lenses to really take advantage of this camera.  If I had it to do over I would probably spend a little extra and go with the D60 and some better lenses.

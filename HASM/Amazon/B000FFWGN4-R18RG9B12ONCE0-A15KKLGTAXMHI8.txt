Title: Its features are its strong point
Content:
I exchanged a Eureka Capture for an equivalently priced Bissell Pet Revolution (due to a boxstore gift card offer on the Bissell,) purely because the Bissell has the detachable canister for mobility, the ability to switch the brushroll off and the (alleged) availability of a bare floor tool from Bissell's website. (It's attachment tools are not the US standard 1.25" size.) In just about every other area the Capture is better, even though the Bissell is good enough for me. The Mar 07 "Cons Reports" review got this model about right by putting it in the bottom tier: In my opinion, the Pet Revolution has far from the best suction for the money, jams long dog hair in the brushroll, has a small dustbin, needs the two foam filters emptied and rinsed too often (the HEPA filter is not washable,) runs a bit hot, includes no hose extension, and has an oddly near-useless combo upholstery/small bare surface tool. As with the Capture, both the pre dustbin area and the small, spinning brush, pet hair tool get jammed by long dog hair. Nevertheless, as long as the extra heat does not indicate future service problems I will be satisfied with the Bissell. However, the gift card which essentially reduced the sale price is what sealed the deal - even with the better features I would not pay more for this vacuum than for the Eureka Capture.

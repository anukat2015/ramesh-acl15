Title: Just what I needed
Content:
I researched every laptop out there before deciding on this one. I'm starting law school so my requirements were: 
lightweight
comfortable to type on for hours
good touchpad
large hard drive--I take a lot of pictures & love me my Itunes 
under $800 and not goofy looking
After about a month I can say I really love this laptop, and think I made the perfect choice. The keyboard is perfect, touchpad is the best I've ever seen on a laptop, smooth & just sensitive enough. It's super fast so far, and HUGE hard drive that I will probably never fill up (though I'll try). It doesn't get hot, is super lightweight & easy to carry around, the screen is perfect--I wouldn't want to go any smaller, and don't need to go any bigger. I like the built in webcam, like the touch sensitive volume controls on the keyboard. I don't even mind Vista, though one of these days we will go through and delete some of the other preloaded stuff that comes on it.
Only improvement I would suggest is one more USB port, but if that's the only compromise I have to make, I'm happy!

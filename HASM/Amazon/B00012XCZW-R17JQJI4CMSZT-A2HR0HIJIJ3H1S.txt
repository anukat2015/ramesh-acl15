Title: Great Brewer!
Content:
I have this brewer at home and bought one for work. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is that the lip of the decanter needs a little improvement to cut down on spillage when pouring, but is not bad enough to keep you from loving this brewer!  This is a wonderful coffeemaker that is simple to use and brews hot coffee very fast. I love it!

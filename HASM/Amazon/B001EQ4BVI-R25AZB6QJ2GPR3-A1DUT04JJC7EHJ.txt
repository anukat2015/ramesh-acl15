Title: The Canon 50D is everything it's supposed to be!
Content:
Hey, Canon fans!  If you're like me, you have put off buying this camera because it costs a bit more than the Rebel line. When you weigh the camera differences against the cost difference, I promise you that the 50D will come out on top. I previously have owned two Rebels. The kit lens (28-135mm USM IS) is very good also. I may never be able to afford Canon's outstanding L-series lenses, but the Canon lenses I do have are Image Stabilized and work perfect for me. The camera is built like a tank and is a little bigger and heavier than the Rebels, but that ends up making the camera feel better in my hands, and I am of average build. The 50D is packed with pro features plus Live View, and is more light sensitive than any other camera I have owned.  Amazon had the best price and they had it in my hot little hands in just a few days!  Outstanding camera. Outstanding price. Outstanding company... Amazon!!!  You may regret putting off this purchase any longer.

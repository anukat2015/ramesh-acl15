Title: Excellent product, great value
Content:
A great little player. The battery life is pretty good, especially if you're just listening to books or music. I watched around 6 hours of video and still had plenty of battery left to listen to some music. 
I've put programs I recorded from TiVo onto it (requires the TiVo desktop software and the software that comes with the player.) I've got my music on it, which I can sync easily through Windows Media Player, but you can also use the included software to make your playlists.  I've put some Audible audio books, and the sound quality on these is great. (This did require an update to the Audible software on my desktop, despite said software telling me it was updated. Not the player's fault, though.) 
The picture quality is fine, though I don't have any experience with any other players. 
All in all, a great little player, and I highly recommend it.

Title: Awesome little heater!!
Content:
This is absolutely one of THE best heaters ever! I purchased this heater last year and absolutely love it! Two things that I was looking for in a heater were a tip-over switch and a thermostat...and this heater has both of those things. The excellent customer service was a bonus. I had a few questions and called the 800 number and got a live person (something you can hardly get these days). I noticed that two people wrote that their heaters caught fire, but maybe they didn't clean the filter? It has a dust filter in the back that you have to clean every once in a while. Anyway, I love this heater and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone!

Title: Heat on you, no where else
Content:
I've had my heater for 2 years and it has been OK but I would like more overall heat.  I carry this heater around with me during the day, where I am the heater is and it works but it can get very hot too, so hot it feels like it's burning you.  If you aren't directly in front of the unit you won't be warm at all so when I'm in my kitchen it's just useless because of moving around.  It's like a fireplace, you go to it to get warmed up but once you walk away you get cold again.  It works best in the bathroom.  I will turn it on and face the unit to the shower and when I get out it's a relief to have it right there warming me up.  I am looking for something a little better at heating the area around me though and not just directed at my lower body.

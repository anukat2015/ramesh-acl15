Title: DUST DUST DUST
Content:
Although I love many things about this camera, I must share one major concern with anyone thinking about purchasing this camera: Dust.  I bouhgt my camera kit 3 months ago, with a wonderful 50mm 1.8 lens.  From switching back and forth between lenses, dust has landed on the COMS sensor, and the sonic dust removal system does nothing to remove it.  It is noticeable in the pictures and the included software doesn't remove it at all.  Had I know the camera needs to be sent away and cleaned professionally (at my cost) every 3 months, I think I would have rethought this purchase.  I've owned many 35mm film camera over the years, and I have become good at cleaning them, but this sensor is just too delicate and the consequences of a mistake too great for me to own a camera like this.  It looks like my window to return it to Amazon has expired too, so I think I might be stuck with a really wonderful camera that is totally impractical to use.

Title: So far, so good!
Content:
Just got this puppy, and it's a godsend!  
400w is plenty warm for under the desk, and no buzzing or other noise to speak of.  The elements are not bright as one commenter was concerned.  
One thing, fire this up for the first time outside for a good 30 minutes to get rid of the nasty epoxy / plastic smell.  It was also larger (taller) than I expected, but that isn't really a negative necessarily.
I'll update this review if it stops working, but so far, so good!

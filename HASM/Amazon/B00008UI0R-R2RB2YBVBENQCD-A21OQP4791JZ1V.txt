Title: Very satisfied
Content:
I have purchased both very good and very bad vacuums in the past.  This one is probably the best.  VERY good suction, easy to empty the canister, and the power stair/upholstery tool works quite well.  The variable speed suction is handy too.  The only thing I would change is the size of the canister - it holds a bit less than other vacuums I've owned.  However, it's only a very minor inconvenience, since it takes seconds to empty.  I realize there are some high end vacuums out there that probably work better, but I couldn't justify paying $500 - 1000 for a vacuum.

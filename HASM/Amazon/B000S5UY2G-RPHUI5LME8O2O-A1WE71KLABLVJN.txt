I don't know why people spend more money for less and locked up hardware from apple. Archos is the way to go!! Lot more memory, touch screen, wifi...it is the great combination.  I think the hard drives can be replaced with a laptop hard drive for larger storage if you want.  The only minor problems with this is the size, but I like the size for movies; the plugins for internet, codecs and other stuff are kind of ridiculous. They should come much cheaper with the device.  Very durable and good piece of hardware! Thanks.

Title: Screen problem and poor battery life
Content:
I talked myself into a HP because I loved the keyboard and size of this unit however within a day I noticed the screen would turn itself dimmer and that the battery was not lasting anywhere near the 10 hours claimed.  I decided to return the laptop and eat the restock fee.  I don't trust a brand that ships with known problems. If it had these problems out of the box, what was going to happen in 3 months.

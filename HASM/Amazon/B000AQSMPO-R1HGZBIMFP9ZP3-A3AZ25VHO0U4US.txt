Title: Excellent and Efficient!
Content:
The B60 is by far one of my best home purchases...ever! I have wasted more coffee by throwing out the unused portion remaining in the old fashioned coffee maker. The Keurig allows me to make a perfect cup - every time. Some reviews have suggested the coffee isn't strong enough. My recommendation is to use a Bold cup and the smallest cup size - this makes it pretty strong! If this is still too weak...then my suggestion is to get an espresso machine which may better suit your stronger, bolder coffee needs.

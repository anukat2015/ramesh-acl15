Title: ipod is better
Content:
I purchased Zune because I was sick of all the ipods out there and wanted to be different. I checked the reviews for Zune and found some good ones. There was one that even stated that the Zune software was better than the ipod's (itunes). whoever said that must have been a plant for microsoft because I purchased the Zune and found the software confusing. I thought it would run through Windows Media Player just as ipod runs with itunes but this is not the case. The Zune software is separate from Windows Media Player. With ipod you only need the itunes. I returned my Zune and got the ipod. there's a reason why they are so ubiquitous: they are better. The scroll wheel on the ipod is just a much better feel and i-tunes is the better player. But be prepared to shell out an outrageous $25.00 for a standard plastic cover (a necessary accessory) if you get one at a Mac store.

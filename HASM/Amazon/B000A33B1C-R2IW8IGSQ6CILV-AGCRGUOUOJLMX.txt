Title: So Far So Good
Content:
I purchased two of these because of a review that broke down the warming power of a customer's basement. I would agree that these work well for the money. They are easy to use and store. As with most heaters, it takes a while to get going, but once the heat of on full blast you can definately feel it working. I only use it for the bedrooms before I go to bed and set the timer for when I wake up. I'm happy with this product.

Title: Great product
Content:
This vac is very powerful. It's heavy and a little hard to move around but well worth the purchase as this thing really sucks! It moves area rugs around as it vacuums! The cord is short so I purchased a 20 foot appliance cord from Walmart. Now I plug it in at one outlet and can vac the whole bottom floor. Bags fill up fast but are cheap on amazon.

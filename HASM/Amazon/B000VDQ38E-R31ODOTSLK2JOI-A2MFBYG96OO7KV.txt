Title: FANTASTIC!!!
Content:
I did alot of research on the bissell pet hair eraser before i decided to go out and purchase one .  I have three cats at home and during shedding season (which is coming up fast again) they all shed like crazy...!  Even with brushing them daily.  I own a hoover upright 17 amp. which i really thought was doing a terrific job, that is until i brought home the bissell!  After 10 minutes of assembly the machine was ready to go!  And go it did!! I had to empty the collection tank 4 times !!!  It picked up everything including the pet hairs that even my hoover 17 amp didn't.  I have always shampooed my carpets (wall to wall) 4 times a year also,so i thought even that would cut down on the hairs etc... Bissell proved it to be all wrong.  I am definitely keeping this machine its amazing!  I recommend this to anyone who owns pets youll be amazed at what it can do!!!

Title: Consider the price!!!  Powerful motor, lightweight, cheap attachments.
Content:
Does a great job on hardwood floors and cleaning up messes.  NOT for use on carpets -- get beater brush for those.  The hose and head are cheap quality, but work just fine.  But for under $80 you get a powerful motor  in a lightweight, maneuverable vacuum.  This is not a luxurious, all purpose vacuum cleaner -- it is a work horse.  With 12 amps of power, my floors are clean of dirt and pet hair in short order.  The floor attachment could use more bristle, but swivels nicely and gets the job done.  Attachments store on board, power cord is stored manually (which is better than a cheap auto cord winder that jams).  Very happy with it- gets the job done with very little cost.  NOT BAGLESS.

Title: Great fun with my little Shuffle!
Content:
What a wonderful treat the Shuffle is.  When I was given an Amazon.com gift card, I was not sure what to purchase.  However, I love music and I wanted something that I could have with me when I walk.  I went through lots of my favorite music that had a good beat and I put my "walking music" on the Shuffle.  I clip it to my shirt or jacket and off I go.
Many friends have commented on the size, color and the clip feature.  I love it!  I don't have to carry it in my hand and it is so light that you almost forget that you have it on.  
Of there was one negative, it would be the earbuds which are hard and would not stay in my ears.  I purchased softer earbuds locally and that made a big difference.  Apple needs to address that as I have heard others say the same thing.
But all in all, this was an excellent purchase.

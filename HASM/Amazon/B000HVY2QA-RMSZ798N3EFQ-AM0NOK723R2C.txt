Title: no good piece of heat
Content:
I needed a heater to warm me up. This thing warms up but not me. It is rated at 1500watt or whatever but all it does is send the heat up to the ceiling which is of no use to me. Yes, you may say that it will eventually warm up the room but its been 6 hours and I'm still cold. I decided to put it under my desk and it is now warming me up. The size of it would probably fool you, leading you to believe it will warm anything bigger than the underside of a desk but it barely does at the highest setting. I dont' know if it is safe to place it where I have it but I figure my chair probably gets warmer than my desk will with this darned thing. I suggest you either get a spot heater (I'm buying this tomorrow-Soleus Air MS-09 Oscillating Radiant Heater) or a forced air kind of heater you can keep next to you. These radiator things don't work! Not only do they take for ever to warm a room they suck when they do warm anything up.

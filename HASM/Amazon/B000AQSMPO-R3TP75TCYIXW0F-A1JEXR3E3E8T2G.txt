Title: No Need For Hype, This Is The Real Deal
Content:
We didn't get our Keruig from Amazon, but I just ordered one as a gift for some friends.  I wouldn't spend that kind of money for junk; this brand of individual coffee maker is the Rolls Royce of it's kind.  It will take ordinary coffee and make it taste far better than what you can get out of a Mr. Coffee, or A Bunn coffee maker.  I use the reusalbe filter with Starbucks Columbian coffee, and am amazed at the difference in the taste from a regular automatic coffee maker.  No it's not cheap, but you seldom get quality at a very low price.  If you are wavering, wondering if it's worth the investment, take it from me, if you are a coffee nut who really loves extraordinanrily good coffee, a Keurig coffee maker is worth the money.  Not only does it make incredible coffee, it's a work of art just sitting on the kitchen counter.  It looks like quality, and it really is.  I'm sitting here writing this review, and getting distracted by thought of going out in the kitchen and making myself a cup.  I think I'll wrap this review up, and yield to the temptation.  You'd do well to yield to the temptation to buy one of these coffee makers.  I can't see how you'd go wrong doing so.

Title: Looks nice, but needs lots of space.
Content:
Unlike many other small heaters, this unit doesnt direct the heat very well meaning that you need to have lots of empty space around it.  The thermostat also doesnt appear to be as accurate as it should.  The system seems to come on even when it shouldnt.  On the other hand, it is a nice room decoration and generates a good amount of heat with almost no noise.  You cant have everything.

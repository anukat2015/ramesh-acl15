Title: A very good beginners SLR for serious enthusiasts
Content:
Many people have already reviewed this camera's technical details & I will skip that. What I shall try to address though is whether this is the right one for you: You can fall into one of the three categories - (a) a beginner who wants to create the beautiful pictures of an SLR but has no interest in going into its technical details ever (b) A beginner who has just entered the world of SLRs and intends to learn its intricacies before moving onto the big league (c) An intermediate who knows the technical details but wants a better SLR compared to previous versions like Nikon D40 or Rebel 300D.
If you belong to bucket (a) this is a good camera, but the Canon 1000D or Nikon D60 should save you some money. If you belong to bucket (b) this is the perfect camera by all means. I fell into this category when I bought it an year back and must say I have had no complaints. You might want to consider the Rebel 500D/T1i now though - based on the price difference(Amazon keeps changing the price of this camera) you will get a Digic 4 processor & the video capability (15 Mp vs 12 Mp is a non issue).
If you belong to bracket (c) & are very serious abt moving up the SLR ladder then buy the Canon 40D or 50D. I have handled the 50D and see a remarkable difference between pictures from that and Rebel 450D. I have now reached a point where the Rebel 450D & the lens are proving to be the bottlenecks to my pictures. Dont get me wrong, I have seen & taken remarkable pics from this camera - but would rather buy a Canon 50D now. Its sensor & USM lens really do stand out.
& for those of you who do not fall in any of these 3 brackets & know the difference between active & passive focusing system, you shouldnt be reading a review for the Rebel series cameras at all!

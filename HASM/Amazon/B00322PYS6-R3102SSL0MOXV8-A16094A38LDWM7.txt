Title: Pretty but not as good as I was hoping
Content:
I just got this and the first thing I noticed was the bright pink cotton candy color.  It's ok but not fantastic.  Kind of looks like cheap Barbie doll plastic pink.  It's glossy but will probably be prone to scratching.  The pearly sheen of my older one helped hide little scratches.  Also, the pink on the inside does not match (at all) the outside pink.  Totally different color palette.  Kind of irritating actually.  The inside pink is more peachy light pink than true pink.  
I had the VGN series up til last week.  It was a beautiful pearly pink color, had a slider bar for volume and backlight - loved it! Unfortunately, that one was a lemon and had too many problems to fix.  They sent me this one as a replacement.  I wish I had my other back, problems and all.  The more I look at it the more irritated I become.  What color blind person designed this?  Why they took that slider bar feature away I have no idea.  Stupid actually.  That was a great feature that I used everyday.  My older one also had a taller screen.  This one feels shorter and stretched out.  It's lightweight which is nice but I am missing my other one.   
Windows 7 is Windows 7 - it's fine.  It works.  It's updated.  Nothing more to say about that.  
Whatever, I am stuck with this I guess.  My recommendation?  Don't bother with this one.  Spend the extra money and get the 2010 version.

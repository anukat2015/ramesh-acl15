Title: Nice Coffee Makers....beats my Gevalia
Content:
I really like this coffee maker (it's good if you have curious children who like to grab at handles on the counter, since no coffee will spill unless they know to press the lever to open the spout, so it's kind of childproof in my opinion). I love the auto-shut off as soon as it's done brewing (one less thing to worry about on rushed mornings). The carafe keeps the coffee hot enough for me, I usually program it so my coffee's ready about 10 minutes b4 I head out of the house in the morning. However, if I'm running a 1/2 hr late or so, the coffee is just the fine. I prefer, maybe slightly "cooler" coffee, compared to the bitter taste of coffee had it sat on a warmer for a 1/2 hour (like use to occur w/ my old glass pot coffee maker). Also, I love the stainless steel carafe and not having to worry about it breaking. My only complaint is that nearly impossible to get every drop out due to the design of the carafe, o/w I would have given it 5 stars. Great price too!

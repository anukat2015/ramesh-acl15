Title: Sweet Little Laptop
Content:
Pros:
I was looking at netbooks, but found them too small.  This is a perfect size for the coffee table, and looks very slick with the brushed aluminum.  I has a really nice screen, and a great keyboard, with the play/pause/volume buttons you need for music playback on the top row.  The HDMI out and 4 USB ports are a plus too.
Cons:
I haven't had any problems with with plastic trim coming apart, as one reviewer did.  The only design flaw that I see is the rubber pieces that prevent the screen bezel from touching the keyboard bezel when the lid is closed are a little too small or shallow, so the screen bezel does get some very slight scratches.  I think this can be minimized by not putting anything too heavy on top of the computer when closed, and not squeezing it too tight when carrying it.  But that's a minor problem.  Also, the computer does get a little warm (esp. under the left palm, probably where the CPU is), perhaps too warm for extended use on one's lap, but it's super quiet -- a trade-off I can live with.
Bottom Line:
This is a great little laptop for the money.  I highly recommend it.

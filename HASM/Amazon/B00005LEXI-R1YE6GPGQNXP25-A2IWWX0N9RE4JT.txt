Title: Carbon monoxide and propane
Content:
I don't (yet) have this heater but it is on my wish list.I'm posting this merely to point out the inaccuracies and potentially DANGEROUS information in the poster who states that propane does not produce CO (Carbon Monoxide).  Visit this site and you'll get plenty of information about this: http://www.carbonmonoxidedeaths.com .Like all fuels, propane gas requires oxygen to burn completely. Appliance malfunctions, vent system blockage and improper installation will reduce the oxygen supply. When this happens, the fuel will not burn properly, releasing CO into the room, and long term exposure can lead to CO poisoning.A bigger problem here is that in an enclosed area, the propane heater can consume oxygen.  In an oxygen-starved room, the propane will continue to burn, and WILL produce carbon monoxide.  This manufacturer was smart enough to include an oxygen sensor to avoid this dangerous situation.  In fact, this manufacturer is a FOUNDING MEMBER of a Coalition for Portable Radiant Heater Safety.  You will find very few portable heaters that are rated for indoor use today.  This is one of them and you should be able to use this safely.

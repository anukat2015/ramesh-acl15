Title: Worthless energy waster
Content:
Unless you plan to put this under your desk for extra feet heat, don't bother buying this. It throws heat out of a cone with fan assist, but the heat disbursement in limited by the fact that they have the thermostat place to close to the vent. No sooner does this warm up, it kicks off. Then it goes back on 30 seconds later. On and off all night - good way to get minimal sleep!

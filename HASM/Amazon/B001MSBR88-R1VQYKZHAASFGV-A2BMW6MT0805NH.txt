Title: I LOVE MY MIELE  ...
Content:
I have had all the well known vacuums ove the past 30 years.  As a child we had a canister. Didn't know how much I missed one til I got my Miele ....No more uprights for me. We have hard wood floors as well as a low loop carpet in some rooms. The other vacs were scratching the floor and pulling  loops out of the carpet.  I read up.... apparently I needed a suction only vac...no beaters
  The blogs were overwhelmingly in favor of the Miele... but soooo many styles ...and a huge price difference.  I settled on the Healthy Clean ...10 plus hours of research.  Apparently when you go bigger... you get internal storage space...  which I don't care about.  It  is so light... moves and turns well ... and VERY QUIET... can hardly hear it.  GREAT on Dog Fur.
  My housekeeper uses it most of the time ....she was the one scratching the floors ...for several years.  She has other clients with a Miele.... hmmmmmmmmmmm    The vacuum of choice for the too busy to vacuum people.  Now I have discovered that several of my friends have them ... a hidden undercover group I guess..... plus I do use it off and on.  Since it is not heavy it is a piece of cake to get out for a quick go around... we have 2 huge Huskey dogs. 
   We have No Complaints after a year... oh I told my husband it was his birthday present.  He believed me ...something  German ...something mechanical.... he is German. Hah!!!!

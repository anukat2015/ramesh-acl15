Title: Working well
Content:
When I heard the iPod touch was a watered down iPhone, I really had no interest in it.  When I started to use the browser functionality, I was pretty much sold.  Before I go somewhere, I often take it along even if I don't intend to listen to it.  Its useful for finding directions or information, provided you can find somewhere that has wireless (Not very hard to do).  Being able to check your e-mail can be handy at times as well.
Oh yeah, it plays music too.

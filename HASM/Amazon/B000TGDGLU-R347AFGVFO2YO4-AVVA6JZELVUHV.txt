Title: Fantasic heater
Content:
I bought this for my Mom's bedroom.  I was concerned that high ceilings might be a problem, but I didn't need to be.  This heater WORKS!  Not only does it keep the bedroom toasty, but it heats the attached bathroom too.  The only problem is the lack of an accurate thermostat, which limits my rating to four stars.

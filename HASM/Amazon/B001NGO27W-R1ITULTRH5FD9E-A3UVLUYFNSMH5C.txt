Title: Great product....
Content:
My hubby is an faithful coffee drinker and was on the market for a new pot.  He researched the hell out of it and thought this was the best....and is THRILLED with it.  It makes up to 14 cups, which is awesome, has a reg or bold setting (bold runs slower/comes out stronger) and I'm glad that it shuts off automatically after two hours, in case you leave the house and forget to shut it off.  The coffee taste delicious and it functions great.

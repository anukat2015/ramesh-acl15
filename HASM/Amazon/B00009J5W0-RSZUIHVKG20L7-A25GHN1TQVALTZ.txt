Title: Windows problems all easily bypassed
Content:
Like other  reviewers, I was excited about the ipod.  This initial enthusiasm was tempered when I tried to install on my XP system.  After much web research I found the simple cures and now my ipod is a pleasure.  I reinstalled all software with my virus software off after a fresh restart.  I sync my whole library with ephpod but use MusicMatch for it's tagging and playlist functions.  I got a powered Firewire connector from belkin to allow charging/powering while syncing with my PC.  I use Outpod to transfer contacts and calendar data.

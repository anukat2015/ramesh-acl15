Title: WE LOVE THIS PURCHASE
Content:
We received a Keurig B40 as a gift.  We LOVED it SO MUCH, that I decided to take the B40 to my office and buy a B60 (with LED clock and timer) for our home.  The convenience is UNBELIEVABLE.  Yes, of course, the coffee costs more because of the need to buy K-Cups; but there is absolutely NO WASTE.  This brewer is PERFECT for a household like ours.  My husband drinks ONLY unflavored coffee.  I enjoy both flavored and unflavored coffee.  My huband drinks NO coffee in the evening.  I like ONE cup of decaf after dinner.  You can brew EXACTLY what you want, when you want it, on only the amount you really want.  This is one of our favorite purchases in a LONG TIME!

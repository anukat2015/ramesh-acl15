Title: Had it for a year now and.....
Content:
this really is the best computer I have ever owned.  It runs today as fast as the day I received it.  There is a bit of a learning curve but it is well worth the time.  I had a minor glitch after installing Snow Leopard but the Apple fixes seem to have stabilized things again.  All in all, a great change for me after years in the Windows environment (still have XP at work and it is frustrating).  Quite simply, this laptop just.......WORKS.......every time.
Thanks Apple.

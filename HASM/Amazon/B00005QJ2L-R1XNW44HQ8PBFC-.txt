I'm not a kid under 13, but my daughter is, and she loves this computer as much as I do. After more than 5 years it has never given a significant problem. It has survived drops, spills and constant use and is still runing like new. I replaced the battery after 4 years and added memory. It is on the heavy side, but hey, its more than 5 years old. Overall, it is a great computer. It is much more reliable than my ThinkPad!

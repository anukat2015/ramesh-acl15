Title: Beauty without the Brains
Content:
I bought this heater a few years ago. I used through part of one winter but got really tired of dealing with it's little quirks. The tiny lasko with the rotary thermostat works better in my opinion.  This Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater has been in my closet most of the time. The thermostat on this tower is electronic and only allows you to set the desired temp in 5 degree increments. Also, the differential appears to be at least two degrees. So, let's say you want a comfortable lounging temperature of 67-68° and know that 65 is too cool to be comfortable. You would have to set the thermostat to 70°F. Even with it set at 70°, the unit does not stop blowing hot air until the room reaches about 72°-73°. So you end up being far too warm for part of the cycle. For some people this would not be an issue, but I can't comprehend why they went this route with the Thermostat. A simple rotary or slice control with 2° variations would be much preferred.

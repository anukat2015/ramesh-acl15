Title: Great Camera - Great Price
Content:
We've owned the Rebel XT for 1 month now.  It does everything we want as avid hobby photographers.  The small body size is convenient for carrying and storage.  The camera works great with our older Quantaray 28 - 90mm lens as well as our Sigma 28 - 200mm lens.  
The Speedlight 430X flash is a must for night/evening shooting.  Does a much better job than the body flash.
Sports mode is incredibly fast - as usual for Canon.  In taking pictures of people diving off rocks into a lake, you can get 5 shots in mid flight...  just for a point of reference.
The 1.8" screen is plenty big to review your shots - don't feel it necessary to go for the 2.5" screen on the XTi.
Our take - save the extra $250 from the XTi and get yourself a good lens.  You can't go wrong with this one!

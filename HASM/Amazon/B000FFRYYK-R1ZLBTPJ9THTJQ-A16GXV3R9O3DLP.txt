Title: Good but could be Better
Content:
I have always loved Bunn Coffee Makers because they are fast and make a great cup of coffee so I was excited to see the ThermoFresh maker.  I don't like reheated coffee so I thought this would be perfect.  I have had it for over a month now, and the SMELL like something is burning that seems to come from the heating unit has finally lessened to a bareable level.  I have never had that problem with any coffee maker and I read a "chat" here at Amazon about the smell so at least I didn't have to worry about something burning if I left the house. I bought the Bunn coffee filters after reading that they were taller and work better. Unfortunately, the coffee grinds still go above the top of the filter.  Very very strange problems for a Bunn, and my Mom recently purchased the regular Bunn Coffee maker with no issues at all.  Well, at least I still enjoy the convenience of having hot coffee for about 3 hours.  I expected more from Bunn.

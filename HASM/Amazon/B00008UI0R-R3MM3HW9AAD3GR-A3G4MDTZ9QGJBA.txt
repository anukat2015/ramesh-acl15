Title: Nice canister vacuum
Content:
This is a very nice little canister vacuum.  It has 3 level suction which is useful.  When using on carpet it propels itself.  I do wish it had an old style soft bristle dusting attachment but I can use the one from my old vac.  You do have to empty the dust bin often because it is small.  Overall I like the vacuum very much.

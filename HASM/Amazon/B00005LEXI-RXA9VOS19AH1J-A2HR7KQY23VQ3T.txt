Title: Mr. buddy heater
Content:
The heater is a good value so far. Very cozy radiant heat, and even at the low setting my cat singed his tail when walking near it, so be careful of this if you have pets. I'd like to see it get better mileage from a 1 pound can of propane, but I do have the 20 pounder ready in case of emergencies.

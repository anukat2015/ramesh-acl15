Title: I love it!
Content:
This is the second under cabinet coffee pot I've had and it gives me more counter space in my small kitchen.  To my knowledge, Black and Decker is the only company that makes this type of equipment and I'm so thankful that they do.  My new coffeemaker has all of the bells and whistles you could ask for and they are all wonderful.  An added bonus is the green light on the water reservoir which lets you fill it in the dark and serves as a night light in my kitchen.

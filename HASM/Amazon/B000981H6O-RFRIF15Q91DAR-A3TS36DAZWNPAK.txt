Title: Awsome!!
Content:
I bought this vac to replace one that I bought at a garage sale for [...].  (The original didn't die--it just got messed up in a utility room fire.)  I also bought one for my mother because I was so impressed with my original one.  I was afraid the new one just wouldn't be the same because mine was an older model.  I was thrilled when I used it for the first time.  It's even more powerful than my original.  I love everything about it, but a great feature is that you can wash the filter.  I washed my previous filter numerous times with no damage.  The only thing I must admit:  I rarely use it for a wet spill, so I can't comment on that aspect.  Would I buy it again?  Absolutely!

Title: Wonderful "Hangable" Heater
Content:
I bought this heater exclusively to hang on my bathroom wall as, due to various reasons, I was unable to have one installed in the ceiling or wall. I have now been using this heater for about 1 year and a half and a completely satisfied with its performance. Keeping the bathroom door shut with the heater on raises the room temperature approximately 5+ degrees within just a few minutes. My only negative input would be having to run through the entire cycle of heating options to get to the one you want or to turn it off.

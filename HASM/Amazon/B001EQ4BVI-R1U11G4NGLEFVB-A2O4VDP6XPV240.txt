Title: a work of art -- two thumbs up
Content:
I was using a XTi before, then moved up to the 50D. Originally, i was only for the enhanced pix count. When started using it, at least two things exceeded my original expectations.
1. the high speed shots when am doing birding -- incrediblly caught each frame thought cculd be missed. this definitely provides me other new possibilities for sporting as well as HDR bracketing.
2. the live view AF-ON's live and face-detect modes. i could not over state how big it helped out for the shot on my wife's food blogging. She said it won't be possible to get such a high mark now without those those helps.
3. one more thing, the LCD and those customizable features...awesome. 
i like the IQ too, incredible.

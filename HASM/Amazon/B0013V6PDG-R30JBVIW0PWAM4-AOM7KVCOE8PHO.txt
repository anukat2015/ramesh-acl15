Title: It does the job
Content:
Easy to set up & use, and it keeps feet nice & warm. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because (a) it's made of hard plastic that's a bit uncomfortable after a while on bare or stocking feet, and (b) it's a bit overpriced. It's just a piece of injection-molded plastic with a small heating element... should be more like $40. It has 3 heat settings: off, foot-warmer, and radiant-panel. Haven't tried the panel setting, but the foot-warmer setting is nice. Would be better if there were more of a range of settings (foot-warm-low, foot-warm-high), and for the price I'd kinda expect this. A good feature is the angled base: when sitting in a chair and stretching your feet out to it, the angle is comfortable on the ankles. I put mine on a plug-in timer: no need to consume 90 watts 24/7, I only run it from 2PM to midnight. In summary, despite the omission of a few minor features and being slightly pricey, I'm glad I got it and I would recommend it to anyone looking to end cold feet under their desk.

Title: Great Camera - Fantastic Deal
Content:
I'm old school, 35m Canon. Gambled on the world of SLR digital and I truly enjoy this camera, great features, light-weight, easy to use. My older premium lenses attached without issue. I shot over 275 photos at a benefit dinner this past weekend, utilizing every possible function without issue, including not having to change the battery. Truly A Piece Of Workmanship. I'm impressed, you will be too!

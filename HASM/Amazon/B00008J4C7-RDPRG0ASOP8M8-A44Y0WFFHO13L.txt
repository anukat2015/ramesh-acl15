Title: Love the features, tough little machine
Content:
Took me a while to find the right website for ordering replacement parts (www.sharkcompany.com/shark).  I'm hoping a new HEPA filter and pre- post-filters shows up in good shape.  
This is a great vacuum, even if you end up dumping out the canister after every room. Hey, if you're borderline OCD like me, you'll get a thrill from seeing how much dirt you're getting out of your house.
Rinsing the HEPA filter worked great. Mine needs replacement only because I cleverly left it on top of my car to dry, and drove off with it still perched up there.  I also tend to smack the daylights out of it during empties. (p.s. 'tapping' the filter clean indoors is crazy, dust flies everywhere)
Only drawbacks to me: the holding handle is awkwardly placed, especially if you store it upright, and a wider dust-brush attachment would be nice. (My husband complains about the high pitch noise of the engine, but I advise him to leave the room or start using our other vacuum himself)
This vacuum is great if you need a versatile, lightweight alternative to regular vacuums, and the attachments are nicely sized for smaller hands.

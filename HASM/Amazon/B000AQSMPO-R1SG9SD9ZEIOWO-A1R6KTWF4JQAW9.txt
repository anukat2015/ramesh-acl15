Title: Wonderful Keurig
Content:
My husband wanted to give me this coffee maker for Christmas.  I had seen it at Costco the week before he started looking for it.  When I contacted Costco they were out and the stock was delayed in delivery.  I checked with Amazon.com and there was the Keurig at the same price and with free shipping.  My gift came within 2 days and we have used it every day since Christmas.  The machine is so simple and its design is compatible with my kitchen...looks great sitting on the cabinet.  My husband uses it as much as I do...it only takes a couple of minutes once you turn it on for it to reach the "ready" stage.  Then to brew each cup of coffee probably takes maybe 30 seconds.  The great thing about the Keurig is that everyone in our family drinks a different type of coffee..my husband and my mother prefer the dark, strong roast while I prefer the medium roast.  This way, I am not making a pot of coffee which I always had to pour out at least half!  Great invention!

Title: I wish it was quieter but...
Content:
otherwise it works great. It is not as loud as some heaters but it definitely makes some noise while operating. At least it is a consistent white noise level and not knocking and pinging like some others.  The LED thermostat is handy for maintaining a range of comfortable heat. I tend to let it overheat the room a bit and then it turns off for longer periods of time. The remote control is very handy for adjusting this and for turning it off when you want the extra quiet for a bit (or turning it on when you suddenly realize you are getting chilly while watching TV). I use one unit for two 12x13 rooms and it gets them warm quickly enough and does a good job of maintaining the heat. I like the feature that turns it off when tipped over and have had this come in handy for safety a couple of times. The tall sleek design also works well with my limited space.

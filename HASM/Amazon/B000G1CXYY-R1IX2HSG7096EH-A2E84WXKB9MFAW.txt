Title: good heater
Content:
I really like this product. It delivers extra heat for long periods of time without overheating or throwing a breaker. I read a review that said it was too noisy for them, but the one I received was not noisy at all. It ran about the same as the one I got rid of because it wouldn't deliver the heat. It works for me, just what I was looking for.

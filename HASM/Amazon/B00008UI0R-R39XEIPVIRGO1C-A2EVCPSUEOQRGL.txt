Title: FABULOUS vacuum!!
Content:
This vacuum rocks. Super-strong suction, good tools, love the dust canister (no bags to further trash the environment!) and the Hepa filter. The filter *has* started putting out a musty smell after being washed, which isn't thrilling, but it's still a great vacuum. As to its effectiveness -- I vacuumed my 5'x8' living room rug with my old Kenmore the day before receiving the Hoover. The next morning I swept with the Hoover -- and it got a whole canister's worth of dirt off the carpet (just 24 hours after having vacuumed)! Very powerful. And the upholstery tool is really effective.
Not thrilled that the upholstery and hard floor tools don't have a 'home' on the canister, but it's a small price to pay. Great machine overall.

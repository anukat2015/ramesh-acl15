Title: Hoover S3765-040
Content:
Needed a canister vacuum and didn't want to be bothered with changing bags. This vac has unbelievable power. My upholstery was never really getting clean with my old upright. This one takes a little getting used to because your pulling it instead of pushing but the bottom line for me is is it really getting my house clean---and that it does! From floor to ceiling! The attachments are good and easy to change because they are right on board. Every control is right at your fingertips. Just having an auto cord winder is a pleasure I never had before this Hoover. This is great and doesn't cost a small fortune like some other high end brands that don't even measure up to this one. Buy it!!!!

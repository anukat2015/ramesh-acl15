Title: Expensive midrange high-end MP3 player
Content:
So you want an MP3 Player. You've heard iPods are nice, right? An older Nano might work.
Here's the rap: there's the Sansa Clip+, made by Sandisk, and it's brilliant. It's about a third of the price of this Nano. It only plays music, but has a lot more features (FM, voice recorder, better codec support) and a jaw-dropping increase in sound quality. It comes in 2, 4 or 8 GB versions, and you can put in cards to make the memory bigger.
Then you have the iPod Touch and iPhone. These buddies are in a class of their own - they're practically portable computers at this point. They play movies, music, games, the whole monty. They run a mini version of the Mac OS, for goodness sakes.
But what if you want a mindpoint between these two excellent machines? You like the Sansa Clip, but you want video support, or a bigger screen? Or you're inching toward the Touch, but you don't need all of that pizazz? If you want something a little larger, really want or need iTunes to manage your music library, and don't mind a small loss in audio quality, the iPod Nano may be right for you. It is easy, simple, fast, and just a plain good product. Apple makes some great hardware (I'm serious - this thing's design will make you melt), and their interface is very well done.
If none of that matters to you, get a Clip or Clip+ and spend the hundred you saved on some nice headphones or some new albums on Amazon MP3. The Nano is nice, but its price isn't far enough away from the Touch's low end product, and the extras don't make up for the hike in price.

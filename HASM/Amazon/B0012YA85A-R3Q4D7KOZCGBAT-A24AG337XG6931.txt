Title: Very Happy
Content:
I haven't used anything other than a point and shoot camera since my senior year of high school (the Nikon I owned didn't have automatic focus/settings and used actual film). I've had my eye on a DSLR for 2-3 years, my husband is a Naval Officer so we have a lot of great opportunities for travel. We both wanted a camera to document our trips with. 
    I ordered this camera a few weeks ago and thus far  am impressed. It took reading the manual and playing with the settings to re-educate myself- after a few hours with the manual the pictures I'm taking are pretty wonderful. I highly recommend this camera and can't wait to add a few new lenses to my collection.

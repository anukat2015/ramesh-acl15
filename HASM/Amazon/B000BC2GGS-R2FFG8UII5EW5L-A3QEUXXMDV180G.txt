Title: Amazon fails to deliver
Content:
Had Amazon actually delivered this item, maybe I could have given a real review.  Since the heater never actually arrived, nor did they send a replacement because conveniently the item no longer exists in their inventory. I can still get the same heater by another vendor through Amazon but now it costs more than twice the amount I paid for it in the first place. So needless to say this was a very bad experience I had with Amazon since nothing was done to satisfy my frustration with the horrible service.

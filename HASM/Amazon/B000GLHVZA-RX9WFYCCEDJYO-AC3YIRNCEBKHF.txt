Title: Vornado Heater
Content:
This product was not up to past Vornado standards. It did a poor job of heating to 2 areas where tried. It was also noisy. I returned it for service. They replaced the motor, which was in stock, but could not complete the repair because they had no replacement power cords. At that point, I requested a refund which is in process. It takes 5 minutes to buy on line, but takes 5 days to process a credit card refund, go figure.
This company has provided quality products at quality prices, I hope they are not going the way of so many American companies, failing to meet even mediocre standards.

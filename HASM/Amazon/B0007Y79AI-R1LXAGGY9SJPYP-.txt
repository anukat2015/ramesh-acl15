Title: Very Small, But VERY Good
Content:
I received this for my birthday and turned out to be the only one in my school with it until Christmas cam and EVERYONE got it. This iPod has very good sound quality and its screen is very clear. It is easy to carry around and if you have a case, don't be afraid that you'll lose it. It is easy to use and the roller thing is very sensitive to everything. Because it is so litte, it sometimes gets lost. It also scratches very easily. On the first day, it was all in scratches and looked really bad until Christmas cam and my brother got me a case from Target. Now it is safe and free from scratches. I am happy to have gotten this for my birthday.

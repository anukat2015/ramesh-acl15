Title: So far so good
Content:
I just got the B60 a couple days ago. So far I love it. I got it at BJ's for $129. with 88 K-Cups, not a bad deal. I like that you can program it to turn on in the morning, so after my shower it's all ready to brew my cup of coffee. My only complaint is that now I'm drinking more coffee than I used to ;-)

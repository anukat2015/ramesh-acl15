Title: JUNK!
Content:
This is the third light weight vacuum that I have bought that didnt last past 3 months (and I live in a one-bedroom apt., so I dont give it a lot of action.)You practically have to beg this thing to pick up dirt..Little suction.  Rickety construction.  Poor durability.  Plus the on/off button is hard to find, and the cord pops out of the socket whenever you move!  They obviously didnt do much user testing on this rolling hunk of junk.ENUF!  I'm going back to a full body vacuum.

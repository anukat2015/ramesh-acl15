Title: Horrible...Horrible!!!
Content:
I bought the Vornado DVH heater from Linens-n-things (by the way, they have the best price if you use a 20% coupon code and pick it up at your local store. About $80). THIS HEATER IS A PIECE OF S!@#. It blows out cold air and never heats up the room. Stick with oil radiator heaters. Eventhough they take up a lot of time to heat, they do the best job of warming up a room.
Vornado DVH is definately not worth the money!!!

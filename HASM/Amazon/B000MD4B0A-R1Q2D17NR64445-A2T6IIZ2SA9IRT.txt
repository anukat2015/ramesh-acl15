Title: Don't trust their manufacturer!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
So I originally bought this player on February 27. I get it three days later and it is dead. That really made me mad considering how excited I was to get the player. So I contact customer service at Acessory Genie and they do get back to me the next day. They offer me an exchange and they paid for the shipping fees. So I get my new player and it is dead too! By this point I left them a pissed off email saying I wanted my money back. 
Basically their manufacturer screwed me over twice. You can't trust the people who make this player in the US because they kept sending out products that don't even work. 
I don't blame Acessory Genie because I actually think the people doing customer service for them is great. They got back to me quickly each time I contacted them. They gave me my refund within 48 hours after they received the product back. They always shipped very quickly to me. I think the only problem Acessory genie has is their manufacturer. I told them they better solve their manufacturing problem or they are going to have a lot of angry customers on their hands. 
Now that I have my money back I'm going to go buy a player locally. At least if a player I buy from Best Buy or somewhere doesn't work, I can take it back the next or following day.

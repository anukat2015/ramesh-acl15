Title: So far so good
Content:
Nice compact, quiet, and safe heater.  Puts out plenty of heat controlled by a thermostat.  Auto turn-off if tipped but very stable.  Fan can be turned on as well, but doesn't really make much difference, so it can be left off for silent operation.  Can't imagine any other heater this size could be a better choice.  It's about 3 feet wide, 6 inches thick, and 10 inches high.  I haven't gone thru a winter with it yet, but it's obvious the heat it puts out will do the job.

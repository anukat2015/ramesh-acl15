Title: great little vac
Content:
This is a great all around small, inexpensive vac for apt or to use with an upright. It comes with tools for small spaces and has a long hose and cord. It has great suction and cord and tools store on the unit. My only complaint is that the tube and tools may leave black marks on the walls if you are not careful.

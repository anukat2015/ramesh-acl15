Title: great camera
Content:
Don't think I can describe all the goodies better than what everyone else here.
Bottom line:  If you're a newbie and are looking to get your feet wet with dSLR, get this camera.  You won't regret it.
It's much more portable (than 40D, 50D..the new 7D)
takes great pictures
the video function turned out MUCH more convenient than I expected.  (1080p would be nice, but that's too greedy to expect in a $800 camera)
Overall:  great camera.  If you're thinking about it, get it.

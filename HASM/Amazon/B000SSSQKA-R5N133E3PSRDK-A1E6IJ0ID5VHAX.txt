Title: Panasonic has SLOW customer service
Content:
First of all, the suction on this vacuum is not very strong. I find that I have to pick up bits of food (like Cheerios) after vacuuming. A vacuum should be strong enough to suck up a Cheerio! Then, I ordered replacement bags from Panasonic's website - it has now been 2 weeks, and they still can't tell me when my order will be completed and shipped. That's ridiculous. I'm going to order the bags from Amazon.

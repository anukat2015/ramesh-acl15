Title: Creative Zen Stone 1GB MP3 Player
Content:
I love this product. It is small, lightweight, has a gig of memory and great sound reproduction. I bought it to listen to music and e-books that I download from Netlibrary.  The software that comes with it won't transfer the books to the player because of license protection. Not a problem, however, since Windows media player will grab the license from the Internet and then transfer the file easily to the Zenstone. The controls are simple and intuitive.  If you just squeeze the dial to the right or the left you can FF or Review what you are listening to without jumping to the next selection--very handy. It charges up quickly when you plug it into the USB port and can play for hours without needing a recharge. And it's a bargain!  Couldn't be happier with it.

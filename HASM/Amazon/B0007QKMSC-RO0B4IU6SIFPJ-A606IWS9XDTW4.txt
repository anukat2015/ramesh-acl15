Title: AMAZING CAMERA
Content:
I have been completely impressed with the Digital Rebel XT from the moment I took it out of the box.
I did get it w/kit lens, which is pretty decent.  But I have also added a Canon 50mm/1.8 and a Canon 100mm/2.0, both of which are amazing lenses.
The camera is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I like the different white balance settings...there's pretty much one for every situation I've been in.
I have gone online into the Canon Digital Learning Center on their website, which offers excellent tutorials on how to use the camera as well as photography in general.
This camera is EXCELLENT.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.  I absolutely love it!

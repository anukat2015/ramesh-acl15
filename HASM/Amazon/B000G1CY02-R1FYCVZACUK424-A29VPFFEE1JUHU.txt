Title: buy an oil filled radiator instead
Content:
The heater arrived with cosmetic cracks.  It was not packaged with an outer box....so expect some damage.  Before returning it I tried it out to see if I wanted an exchange or refund.....I went with the refund.  It gets warm fast but it doesn't heat a room like an oil filled radiator.  It looks cool, but I was looking for "feels warm".

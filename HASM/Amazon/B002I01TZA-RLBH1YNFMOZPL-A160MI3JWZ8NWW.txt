Title: Square Trade Warranty Services
Content:
I have purchased warranties from Square Trade because I felt they offered a good warranty compared to the warranties you can purchase in the department store when you purchase your items at a much lower price.  It was well worth it when I purchased the warranty for my HP computer.  Square Trade's representatives were polite, friendly, and helpful when I called to report my computer died.  They were quick in sending out the paperwork that needed to be signed and very quick in making a total refund to me for my computer.  I recommend this company highly.  I would not deal with any other warranty company.  You get a great price; friendly service; and most of all they stand behind their product.

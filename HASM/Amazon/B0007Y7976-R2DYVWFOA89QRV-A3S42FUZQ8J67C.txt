Title: I love this Ipod
Content:
I love this Ipod! It's a beautiful hot pink/Magenta color and has a ton of room on it. I am able to fit all of my favorite songs as well as a number of podcasts from my favorite radio show that I can listen to while I am at work. It's small, light, pretty and just a wonderful little device to have and so simple to use. I never leave the home without my pink Ipod and I can use it for 8 hours straight without it even losing half its battery power and I leave it plugged into my computer overnight so it is fully charged the next day. This is the PERFECT present for anyone. I highly recommend it!

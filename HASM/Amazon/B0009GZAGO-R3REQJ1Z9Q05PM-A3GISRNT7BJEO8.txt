Title: One of the BEST entry-level DSLRs on the Market.
Content:
After deciding to get into the DSLRs, I spent about 6 months researching and learning all I could about them. After finding that the D40 was on the horizon, I decided to wait and see. The D40 didn't seem to be near the camera the D50 was. FINALLY, i took the dive. I could not be happier as this camera is, in my opinion, the best entry-level DSLR still on the market... but not for long. In retrospect, I'd buy this camera again... only sooner.

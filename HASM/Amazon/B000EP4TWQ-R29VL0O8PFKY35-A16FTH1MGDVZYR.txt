Title: Nano Field Recording
Content:
I've only usd the Nano for recording classes at a music camp.  I used the Micro Memo from Xtreme Mac with it.  It seemed to work fine for my purposes.  The recordings are certainly clearer than most of the tape recorders I heard but not as clear as an Edirol.  What I liked was the recording time and not needing other memory sources.  With better mics the recording might have been clearer.  There is a hum that was present but it didn't affect my use.  The buttons are a little sensitive but I got used to them and only accidentally deleted one file.  At the end of camp I had it in my pocket. Maybe I was continually pressing a button by mistake but the Nano froze.  I solved the problem by letting the battery drain and recharging it, which took some time.  I look forward to using it like a regular Nano.

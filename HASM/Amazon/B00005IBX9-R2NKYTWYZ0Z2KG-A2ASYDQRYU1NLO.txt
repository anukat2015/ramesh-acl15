Title: Like better coffee?
Content:
We wanted better tasting coffee. No matter what brand of coffee maker we tried (usually costing less than $30.00)our coffee did not taste good. Our previous high-end coffee maker lasted less than a year so I didn't want to return to that brand. After checking with other coffee-loving co-workers this brand name became a common factor in the conversations. So, we joined other coffee lovers! The coffee is great again

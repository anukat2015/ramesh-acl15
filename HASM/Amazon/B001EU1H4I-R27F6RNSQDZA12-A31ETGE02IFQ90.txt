Title: longevity
Content:
We have had the Black and Decker spacemakers for years (not the new model yet), and my only complaint is their short life.  I would spend more for one that would last more than a year.  Because I like the fact that it mounts and you don't have to use the carafe for the water, I will continue to buy them.

Title: great for the money
Content:
I did a lot of research before purchasing this.. It has exactly what I wanted.. some memory AND a line in.  I paid around $80 for it.. and you'd be hard pressed to find another 8 GB for the money.  Can't be used with napster, but there is more than 1 record store in town.
The controls take a bit of getting use to, but so did my ex-girlfriend.. and I kept her for 3 years. I had a H-10 before this and it lasted a rough and tumbled 8 years.
Bottom line.. for the music and storage, and sound (several eqs to choose from or make your own,.. a definite.. This also has a built in recorder for voice, FM radio, record off the radio, and 2 decent speakers.
You'll pay a little more for white.. but iriver is a very good company that hasn't made alot of noise. However you don't necessarily have to make noise to be good.

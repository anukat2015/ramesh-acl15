Title: Beware of Reviews --- Here's a Review
Content:
After looking at Zunes and iPods, I got a major league headache. Neither of these units seem to do everything that they should for the high price tag and all of the hype. Clearly, Micro$oft and Apple are getting way too big for their britches. Still, they'll probably make the definitive moble media player in 10 to 12 generations and it will probably be fairly priced. In the meantime, SanDisk makes this little gem. It doesn't do everything, it just does what it needs to do --- which is to play mp3s. No hype, no crazy price tag, easy as pie to use (drag and drop), good sound quality (use decent headphones), good screen/picture for what it should be used for (identifying song titles), compact size (like a pack of Double Mint gum), light as a feather, and just a hint of coolness (you can even configure the EQ to your specifications and not just to a preset like Zune and iPod). As others have said, it's the best mp3 player for the money --- and you can still look up Zune's and iPod's later generations for hopefully a more complete solution --- after all you won't be broke (or committed to the Zune Marketplace or iTunes).

Title: Great BUT
Content:
I can understand why people loves these machines. They are so quiet, and they are light. However, there are a couple of design flaws that drag down their usefulness, especially when you factor in the high price:
1) The SEB 213 powerbrush that comes with this model works awkwardly with carpets. We have a couple of short-piled ones, and it's a push to use the powerbrush. I can do it, but don't especially like it. If we had high-pile carpets, I doubt we could use this vacuum.
2)Furthermore, this powerbrush is quite difficult to remove and reassemble. The big problem lies in the connector cord that plugs into the handle.It's a struggle to get it out and even harder to get it back in. If you remove the head to suck up dirt along the edges, you have to go through this struggle a lot.
We have found that we no longer use the powerbrush at all. We just use the "floorbrush" on both carpet and bare floors. While it is even a bit harder to use on our carpets than the powerbrush, the struggle to attach/detach the powerbrush makes it worthwhile to stick to the plain brush.
For anyone with a lot of carpets, this is not the vacuum to get. For someone like us with mostly hard floors, I would NOT get this model. I think were I to do it all over again, I'd get the Miele model 4210 Carina which comes with a simpler floor brush and save about $150. If you want HEPA filters, there's the 4210 Sirius for a bit more money. Or look up Consumer Reports' recommended Sears model and get one of those.

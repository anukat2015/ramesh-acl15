Title: What a great vacuum.
Content:
The Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum is the best vacuum I have ever had.  The powerful suction is awesome and this vacuum cleans extremely well.
The suction levels are easily selected, and all three levels clean very well.  The power nozzle on/off control is right next to the suction control, and next to both is another button that turns off both the suction and the power nozzle with a single button press.
I love the bagless feature -- no more bags to deal with.  Cleanup is fairly easy, too.
The vacuum is lightweight, and the powered hand tool is great for stairs.  I also like the long power cord and its auto rewind feature.
The design looks space-age and I like how it looks.  It also stores well in our closet.
We like this vacuum so well that we bought one for our daughter-in-law.  She loves it, too.
This is an outstanding canister vacuum.

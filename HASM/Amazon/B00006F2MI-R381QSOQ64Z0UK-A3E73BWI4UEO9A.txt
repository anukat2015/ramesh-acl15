Title: Some problems but I still love it.
Content:
I received this coffee pot around a year ago. 
We had the basket door pop open on us once you just have to make sure that it latches and there should be no problem.
Around December of last year it started brewing only partial pots of coffee: I called Cuisinart and they said to de-calcify the pot. I didn't believe that this process would take care of the problem but I was going to try. I filled the reservoir with 1/3 vinegar and the rest with water and let it sit for about a 1/2 hour. I ran a cycle through and there was a full pot of vinegar water. I was thrilled. Now that is part of my routine about every two weeks and has not been an issue since. 
It does take a few minutes (5-8) to clean the grinder and filter basket but I really don't mind I just do it every evening when I get home from work. 
During the week the carafe doesn't really make a difference to me because I pour a cup and leave the house but on the weekend when I drink more than one cup it stays hot for hours and does not get burnt or sludgy. 
Recently, water began leaking on the counter, I was upset. I called Cuisinart on Monday and I got a brand new coffee maker on Wednesday now I have to mail the old one back along with $10.00 not a bad price to pay, I guess. I think that every coffee pot that I ever owned has leaked; maybe it's me.
Overall I am very happy with this unit. Yes, the grinder is very loud; it is only on for 30 seconds at the most I can live with it. If you don't feel like washing a coffee pot every day and don't like loud noise I would not recommend this to you.

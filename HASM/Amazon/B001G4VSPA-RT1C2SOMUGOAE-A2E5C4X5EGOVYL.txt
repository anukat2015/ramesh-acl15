Title: Tremendous Space Heater
Content:
This amazing space heater does a great job for heating a room.  I too got it at Costco for around $54.00.  It heats up quicker than an oil-filled portable unit and is virtually silent.  I stuck it in an 9'x9' room, turned it on the low-setting, and turned thermostat down to about one-third (relatively speaking).  With the door closed, the room was sweltering warm.  I could only imagine what this little unit would do on high. Another nice characteristic is that it is relatively flat, so it can be put right next to a wall, minimizing the amount of real-estate you have to give up. I've already gone out and bought two more: one for work and another for my mom's house.  I definitely like this unit better than the small convection-type heaters that are ubiquitous.  Although I'm still breaking it in, I highly recommend this heater.

Title: Use it and dump it!
Content:
We bought this last winter but used it very rarely.
 This winter it broke down only after a month of regular usage.
Very affordable and light weight.I loved it until it lasted, although I never got the heat setting right so I always left it on low. 
Waste of money.Had to buy a different heater this year.

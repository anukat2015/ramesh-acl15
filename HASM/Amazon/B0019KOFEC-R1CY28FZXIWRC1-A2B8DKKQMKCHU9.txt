Title: Great Little Vacuum
Content:
Bought this to replace my 15 year old+ Eureka Canister vac, based on reviews, here. Great little vacuum, more suction power.  Pet tool is awesome for couch, etc. Wife loved the gliding wheels of the floor attachment onn the laminate floors. She likes the weight of the entire unit as well.

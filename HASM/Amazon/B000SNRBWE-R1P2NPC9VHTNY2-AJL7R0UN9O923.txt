Title: Easy fix for switch that won't turn off...
Content:
I've had this vac for a year and it's been great except like some of the others, the switch broke and I had to unplug it to turn it off. Unplug the vac and take out the screws that hold the handle together. It won't come apart completely but enough for the plastic piece that is used to turn it on and off to come off, it has the printed words 'carpet', 'floor', 'off'. The piece is poorly designed and therefore fails easily.  Underneath is the real switch with a square black slider button. I moved the switch back and forth to make sure it wasn't stuck. I plugged in the vac and it turned off and on and it worked perfectly. I threw away the outside piece, screwed it back together and it works fine, It's just a little harder to reach but it's a easy fix.

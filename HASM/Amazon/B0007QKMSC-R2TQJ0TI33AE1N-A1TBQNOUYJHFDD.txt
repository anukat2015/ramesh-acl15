Title: I can not wait until I make my next trip
Content:
So far, my new Canon camera has been so easy to use. It is very intuitive. But I have had Canon cameras in the past. I have had to adjust to the multiple focus points but I can tell it will be a very useful tool.
I have been able to take great pictures here at home. I can not wait until I make my next big trip and really use my zoom.

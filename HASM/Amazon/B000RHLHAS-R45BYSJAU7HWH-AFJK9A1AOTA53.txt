Title: Honeywell HZ341BL Ceramic Heater with Remote - near perfection at a good price
Content:
The Honeywell HZ341BL ceramic space heater with Remote is an excellent product:  I would have given this a 5 star rating if it had a start-up setting.  The remote comes close to an auto start function, unless my bath door is closed or I forget.  Either way it looses it's impractical to remote start-up in an open bathroom.
Another missing feature is a back-lighted display, a slight inconvenience for the dark winter mornings for those, who like me, prefer to gradually meet the seasonal artificial light.
Bottom line: It works as advertised; unpretentious, space and energy saving, oscillating with count down timer and heat settings & actual temp display.  
A good value I would purchase again, even with the stated caveats.

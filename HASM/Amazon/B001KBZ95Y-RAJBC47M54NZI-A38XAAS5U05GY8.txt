Title: Looks good until it drips and splatters during pause and pour
Content:
Great size, nice design, aesthetically. But it drips onto the warming plate every time that you make it pause to pour during brewing, which gradually erodes the surface of that plate and makes the carafe stick to it. It often splatters when you pour from the carafe even after brewing stops. So you end up with coffee splatters all over the coffeemaker and counter. Best alternative: Look for one of the discontinued Krups models on eBay. Brand new ones show up occasionally, even. You'll pay the original, new cost ($40), but they're the only 4-cup models that ever worked fully, without drips and spatters, of the 3 or 5 brands that I've tried.

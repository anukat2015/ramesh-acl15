Title: Absolutely Incredible!!!
Content:
I'll get right to the point since all the other reviews covered any and everything imaginable. This was an upgrade from my D70s which I've had for about 3 years now. While the D70s is a great camera for still and slow moving subjects, I realized that it had it's limitations (focusing speed on fast moving subjects,small viewing screen size - 2.5", etc.). After watching the D300 demo videos on Nikon's website, scrolling through the features and menues on the camera and snapping a few shots, I can tell you that this is an "Incredible" camera! The speed and features are like nothing you can imagine! For a camera of this quality and price range, you can't go wrong! This is truely a "Pro Quality" camera!

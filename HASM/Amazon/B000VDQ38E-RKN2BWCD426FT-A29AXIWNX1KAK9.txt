Title: So Far, We Like it!
Content:
We have only had this vacuum for about a month, but it seems to be very good.  It picks up tons of pet hair, and leaves the carpet fluffy and soft.   We had a Bissell prior to this, and it died right after the 1 year warranty was up, so we'll keep our fingers crossed on this one!

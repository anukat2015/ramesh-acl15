Title: I like the Ipod, but not Itunes
Content:
The Ipod does everything I wanted it to do. It's light and convenient to carry when working out at the gym. But the Itunes software does not sync with my main music application - Musicmatch so I have to contantly delete the directories and refill them. I like Musicmatch better.

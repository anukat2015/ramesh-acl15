Title: Vacuum ok, attachments awful
Content:
I bought this vacuum because it's a "Pet Hair Eraser".  Well, I have two cats and have to say that the vacuum works ok.  I have a very short pile rug and after using the vacuum, it not only cleaned it, but lifted the fibers and made the rug look new.  However, on my one area rug, it doesn't pick up all the hair.  I have to take my hand and go over it again.
The attachments are useless.  I tried both of them on the couch and it was a joke.  The Pledge Fabric Sweeper does a much better job of removing the hair.  Side note - you can pop the Pledge thing out and reuse it.
It also does need to be wiped down with a damp cloth after using it.
So I'm disappointed that it doesn't work as well as I thought.

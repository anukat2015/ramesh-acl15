Title: Fantastic little machine
Content:
I use this laptop for work and it is light, has a long battery life and is pretty damn speedy.  For the price, it is unbeatable, I have had many laptops in this size (all of them more expensive), and I can honestly say that I have no need to upgrade any feature.  For work stuff; fast, light, long battery.  For gaming; i have no idea.

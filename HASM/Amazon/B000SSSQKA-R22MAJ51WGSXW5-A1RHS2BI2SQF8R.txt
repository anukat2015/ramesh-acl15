Title: Great little vacuum cleaner
Content:
Well, I can't speak to longevity, as we have only had this a couple of weeks.  But it works just great.  We have a vacation home with limited space, and this really fills the bill.  After buying the house, we went through it with this vacuum cleaner (after "professional cleaners") and picked up a ton of pet hair and other stuff.  The head design is excellent for maintaining a lot of suction.  It is very light and has a convenient carry handle, which makes it a breeze to do stairs.
The only real negative is that the attachments are quite small.  I am not sure you would want this as your primary vacuum cleaner.  Bags are a bit expensive and not as easy to find as some other brands.

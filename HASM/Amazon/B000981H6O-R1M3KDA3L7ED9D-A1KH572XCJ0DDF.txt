Title: This is trash! A  minus1 star would be the proper rating
Content:
What?  Who are these people giving this item multiple stars? Are they crazy? Using this is like vacuuming with a soda straw. This is the most worthless bit of trash I have ever bought. Probably because of the way it is designed. The base of the nozzle--the part that actually touches the floor measures 3 inches by one inch--BUT look again. The actual hole through which things are sucked, measures a tiny one inch by 1/2 an inch! That is less than one square inch of suction. Plus the plastic surrounding the hole actually prevents you from getting close to the things you want to suck up. I can not believe that Hoover puts their good name on this useless little machine. Save your money. DO NOT BUY the Hoover hand held wet/dry vac.

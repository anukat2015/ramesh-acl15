Title: Great Camera!!
Content:
This is my first DSLR camera and I love it!!! I'm still learning all its features, but so far the photos I have taken far surpass my old point and shoot camera. This camera works great with the 75-300mm zoom lense I bought with it. It is not an image stabilized lense, but it still took great shots of hockey players in motion! I can't wait to take it to the Blue Angels airshow in November!

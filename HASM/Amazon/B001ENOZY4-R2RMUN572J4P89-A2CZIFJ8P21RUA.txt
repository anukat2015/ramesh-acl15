Title: Very happy with this
Content:
I am pretty new to Semi-Pro DSLR camera, so I'm not gonna write much on this review but few impressions about this camera.
Bit Heavy, Lousy, 12bit RAW, heavily compressed JPEG.
but 
Easy to Use, Professional Look, Relative Fast Shutter Speed, Fast Focus
I just love it!

Title: Man does this thing suck...
Content:
I was very hesitant about buying this vacuum...suspicious as I am, I didn't trust the reviews here.  Then I read some Hoover reviews which blasted that product and so at least I know that Amazon isn't tossing the bad reviews (like some other sites do...).Anyhoo, this is one incredible little machine.  My first canister vac, bought to replace an aging upright that smells like wet dog.  This vacuum can really do it all.  As far as I am concerned it does carpets every bit as well as even high end uprights....and so much more.  Dare I say it: I am even having fun vacuuming now.  After revacuuming my apartment with this vacuum, I filled the entire filter space with dust and crud which had previously been missed by my upright.  Lots of groovy attachments to get into the nooks, and great for the car.  And the power cord even rewinds ALL THE WAY...maybe that's just a novelty to me but I have never had that happen before with other vac's.The only problem I can see is that there is a significant amount of air leak around the joints in the wand, which are not quite what you would call "tight," but $0.10 worth of saran wrap fixed that little problem.  I highly recommend this vacuum...support quality products and buy one.

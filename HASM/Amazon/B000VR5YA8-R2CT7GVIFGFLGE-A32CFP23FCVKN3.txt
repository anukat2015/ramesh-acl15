Title: A camera that allows you to hold it
Content:
Since I moved from the D70s to D300 it has further increased my pleasure to press the gentle button to capture a moment. This camera is extremely stable, especially with the VR function in the Nikon Lens. The menu has many choices to enable specific photography. Also the continuous shooting is a real improvement and makes very beautiful action-pictures. Very pleasant is its LED matrix focus device that can be seen in the viewer. Real super technology for the amateur/professional photographer. 
Amazon.com is giving the best price/package ratio, after my search on both the web and specialized shops in the DC area.

Title: Great if you only need it to work problem free for 6 months!
Content:
This vacuum was great...for about 6 months. Small problems at first - cheap attachments that break easily ... the power cord stops retracting on a regular bases..then the power switch starts getting tricky on you..finally when you plug it in NOTHING. It doesn't turn on anymore and the light that comes on to tell you it's plugged in doesn't light; it isn't the outlet or anything else other that a rip off vacuum. I bought this in September of 2006 - it's in the garbage end of April 2008. So for the past 17 months or so I paid about $10 a month to vacuum my house once a week. That's about a little over $2 each time I used it (and I skipped some weeks.) DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM. The good reviews come from the people who just bought it and haven't used it long yet.

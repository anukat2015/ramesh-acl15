Title: Short Wire
Content:
When I brought my last Farberware coffee pot, it had a longer wire.  This pot came with a short wire and I don't have a alot of outlets in my old house so I can't plug it in where I want to.  If you have a longer one I would like to buy it.  I know it is for safety but I'm a senior and very careful.

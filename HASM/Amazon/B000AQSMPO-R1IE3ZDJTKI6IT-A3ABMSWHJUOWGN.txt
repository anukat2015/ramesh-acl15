Title: LOVE IT (ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIT NOISY)!
Content:
I was interested in a 1-cup coffee system because I was constantly wasting coffee by making too much.  I was going to purchase a different brand and just happened to check out the Amazon website and found the reviews on the Keurig.  I ended up purchasing one at a local Linens N Things store (w/a 20% off coupon) because I didn't want to wait for one to ship from Amazon.  Needless to say, I am more than pleased.  I love the convenience of it, even though it is a bit noisy.  I purchased a cheap battery-operated frother and make my own lattes using flavored creamer(s).  My kids also love it because they can make their own hot chocolate and tea!

Title: Excellent product but hangs
Content:
Ipod is an absolute necessity, whether you are travelling in the subway, working or most importantly running. Nothing new, hah! 
My experience with ipods is that they hang and then need to be discharged completely before recharging and reusing. This is painful and annoying.
I have had to send my ipod for repairs twice, that is a very big number for a period of 11 months.
However, I still love it and carry it with me everywhere.

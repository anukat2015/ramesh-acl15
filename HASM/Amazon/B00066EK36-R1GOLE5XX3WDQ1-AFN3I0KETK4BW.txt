Title: Cheap and sounds Great
Content:
This thing is tiny and sounds great.  I wish it had playlist support, like Amazon is saying, but it does not.  It is, however, cheap, tiny, and sounds great.  
Other reviewers who did not like that it couldn't resume (see Audio menu, resume feature  (Mine was defauleted to on, actually)) and the sound faded in (see Audio menu, fade in, turn it off, dur) are not even looking into the menu of this very simple player.
Sure, I would have liked more storage, but that's what being cheap is about. 
Updated:  I like this even more after about a month with it.  I've turned into a 64kbps WMA person rather than a 128kbps MP3 person.  I love how you can delete a song easily when it pops up with just four button presses.  I also really like how you can select a certain track while in shuffle mode (like if you hear a song and think "I'd like to hear this other song" you can, all while still in shuffle mode.)
I'm wearing mine in a lanyard around my neck and using some better earbuds than what came with it (Sonys, and I have even better Sony buds on the way.)
I've never had a problem with it freezing, but if the battery gets really low, it forgets where it was and resumes from the first track on the drive.
I would definately buy it again, but I'd get the 512.  But this is working great for me.  Battery life is approx 14 hrs.  
Note: People who don't know how to navigate this aren't trying or are challenged in some way.  This thing is really simple.

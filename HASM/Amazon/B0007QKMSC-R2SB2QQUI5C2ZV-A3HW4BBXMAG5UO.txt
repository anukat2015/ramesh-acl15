Title: Great Buy!
Content:
Overall this camera is a great buy.  I have seen what others have said about the auto focus, it tends to focus on the wrong things in the seven point mode.  You can bypass this in the P mode by choosing the central point focus, but then you lose out on the other Auto features.  The only other problem I have had is that the flash sometimes seems out of sync.  Some of my shots you can actually see the flash on the left side of the picture, that it hasn't made it across in time.  
But don't let this slight irritations stop you from buying it!  Compared to the point and shoot models out there this slr camera for the price is superior.

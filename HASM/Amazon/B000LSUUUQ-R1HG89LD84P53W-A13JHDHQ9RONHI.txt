Title: Do not buy this
Content:
Bought this to warm a cold study but it started sparking on the 3rd use ( and past time I could return it).  Completely defective - I can hear loose wire when I pick it up.  The sparks were frightening - if I hadn't been in the room I don't know what might have happened but now I understand how space heaters burn houses down.

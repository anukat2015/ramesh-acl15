Title: Delightful Camera - But Avoid Sensor Cleaning
Content:
Did you know digital SLR cameras have a little secret?  Every time you switch from one lens to another dirt can get inside and ultimately on the sensor.  
In film SLR cameras that dirt gets carried away on the film, so it doesn't accumulate.  
If you want to avoid going through image degradation and sensor cleaning cycles then you may want to buy the one lens that will satisfy you and leave that lens on the camera.  
The standard D50 works well for me.  It takes quick excellent pictures at home.  Still I wouldn't mind having the longer zoom from the D70S.  
If you have other camera uses in mind you may want to figure out how to buy the D50 with the lens you want.  You might even buy the D70S which one of my relatives loves.  
I have had the D50 for three months and find it to be an excellent camera.  I particularly liked the April 6 review here.  Remember though that this is a big camera and might not be what you want as you walk about on vacation.

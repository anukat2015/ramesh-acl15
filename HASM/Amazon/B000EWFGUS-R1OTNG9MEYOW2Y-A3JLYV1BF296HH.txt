Title: A great coffeemaker
Content:
This is much better than anything I have seen in the store. Granted I didn't go from store to store, so decided to purchase on line. It is a great looking, well functioning coffee maker. It is a very nice looking red. The decanter is comfortably large and drip free....which was one of the most important features to me. The water arm is trouble free and not even worth a mention except in one or two of the other reviews it was a negative, but so easy to become accustomed to that it amazed me that anyone could think it was a problem. It arrived 2 days after I ordered it but am still waiting for the permanent coffee filter which according to delivery information takes about 10 days from order date. No problem, used paper filters till I get it. Thought the permanent coffee filter was worth the extra money. They stay relatively clean as I have used others. The programming is a snap and you really don't even need the manual as one of the other reviews pointed out. The coffee it brews is just as good as any other and really depends on the coffee you choose. It also serves a nice hot cup of coffee. For a reasonable amount of money for a coffeemaker, I am well pleased and I say "GO FOR IT!"

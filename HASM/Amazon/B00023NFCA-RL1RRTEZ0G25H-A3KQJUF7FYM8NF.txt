Title: Best Digital SLR under [...]
Content:
First of all, Minolta has a [...]. Go to their website [...].
Minolta did have some problems at first. Backfocusing and download speed from the camera to the memory card. Both issues were taken care of free of charge by Minolta.Latest software version is 1.10.
Now in regard to the flash overexposure. Yes some do dial in -1 flash exposure compensation while others say they have no problems. Not sure just how wide spread this problem really is.Again you can send it in for warranty check out, if you want.
This is a great camera and with the "Anti-Shake" feature there's no need to buy special lenses. [...] :o)
Happy trails,

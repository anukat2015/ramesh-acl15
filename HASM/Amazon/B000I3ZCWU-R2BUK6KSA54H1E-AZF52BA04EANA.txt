Title: Great Buy!
Content:
Very pleased with the purchase. After much research decided on the Rebel XTi and could not be happier. The camera is very easy to use if you are looking for a good beginner /novice slr camera. Since I got it for Christmas I have taken over 3000 High School hockey pictures that have turned out great for not being a high end digital slr! Anyone who takes indoor action shoots knows all the issues regarding that! With a good editing program I have significanty reduced all my lighting issues! 
Very good clarity on all pics! Sometimes a bit slow, but not bad. My husband who usually can not even take pictures with a point and shoot camera has produced beautiful pictures with this camera as well. He loves it too. Definitely worth the purchase! Extremely fast delivery from Amazon and arrived in perfect condition.

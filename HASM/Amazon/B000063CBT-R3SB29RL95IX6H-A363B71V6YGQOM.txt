Title: Excellent value
Content:
I don't know why some of these people are complaining, I've owned this coffee maker for over two years now with daily use.  It still works just as well as the first day we got it: perfect coffee every time.  It's easy to use, great size and design, large capacity, and great style.  My one complaint is that it would be good if there were a separate water reservoir for the steam system, it's very easy to accidentally brew with the extra water that's intended for steaming with.

Title: Movies are GREAT on this
Content:
I now have 15 movies on my Classic, from animal house to Eric Clapton's Guitar Festival.  They are easy to load and great to watch when flying. My wrist gets tired holding it during long movies, as I do not have a stand (apple should make one). The music is great too! Time to upgrade that old unit as this one still has the space to hold your songs and now movies at a much more reasonable price than the Itouch.

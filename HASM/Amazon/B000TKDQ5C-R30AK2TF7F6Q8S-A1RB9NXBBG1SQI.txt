Title: Excellent item
Content:
Very pleased with this item.  I once borrowed a much more expensive heater, and it was no
better than this Lasko.  In fact, the expensive one was much less practical because it was not easy to move around.  A reviewer mentioned that the Lasko does not have a turn off switch, but that is not really correct; when it is in the standby mode, it is off. It also should be noted that the build quality of the item is excellent.  Advice to prospective buyers:  don't let the low price fool you.

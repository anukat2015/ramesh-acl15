Title: Great Heater! Keeps you nice and toasty!
Content:
I love this heater. I did my research before buying it, and I was definitely pleased with this purchase. This heater is worth the price. It does an excellent job of heating a small to mid-sized room.I like the fact that you can set the temperature, mode, and time it to automatically shut-off, which is great for when I'm drifting off to sleep. I like the design, too. It's rather sleek. It kind of looks like a back-in-the-day radio, though.lol. It's pretty light, too. I move it around from room to room, sometimes. It slides against the wall, and stays out of the way. It's not at all bulky. I've been able to use it in a room that's as small as a bathroom. If you're searching for a fantastic space heater, search no more! I love this thing. The only con: I did notice a small spike in my electric bill, so don't get too carried away with leaving it on all day.

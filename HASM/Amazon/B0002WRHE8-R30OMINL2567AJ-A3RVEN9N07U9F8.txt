Title: Garage Buddy
Content:
I've had my Big Buddy since 2006 and use it all the time.  I restore cars for a hobby and find myself in the garage quite a bit.  This heater really takes the chill of the air when it's cold outside.  It's portable and easy to use. The optional hoses that are available allow me to connect it to a 20# propane tank which is great for when I may be using the heater for extended periods of time.  Amazon has a great price on the Big Buddy so I just purchased one for my son.  It will come in handy for his outdoor projects or family camping trips.

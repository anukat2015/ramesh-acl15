Title: Great Deal, occassional gliches
Content:
I was able to purchase this from an Amazon market place seller for about $25 bucks.  It was brand new unopened in the infamous clamshell casing.  It worked superbly for a week.  Now it works great 95% of the time. One day, I stuck it into the usb port of an older work computer and it now has two minor glitches regularly:  
1. If I turn up the volume a little, it will go all the way to max volume, either needing a soft reset or for you to go to the main menu and then lower volume.
2. It will not shuffle songs, if you reset and had on shuffle it behaves as if not on shuffle. repair: just turn shuffle back off and on again.
I use it daily and 1. glitch happens maybe every other week or so, i guess when I charge the drive on the computer. (as far as I know it charges on computer only, i think for about 3 to 5 hrs, I leave it on as soon as I get home or over night.) I tried an external usb charger but not notification of charging appeared on screen.
FROM USER ERROR the FM radio didn't have any sound, but I discovered that play/pause toggle button will mute it. 
Remember when putting microSD in it has to organize info first so can take 5 mins or more to load larger microSD card (2 gigs).

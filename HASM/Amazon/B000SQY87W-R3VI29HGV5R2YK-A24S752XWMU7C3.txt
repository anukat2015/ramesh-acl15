Title: Excellent Portable Air Conditioner for Heat Wave
Content:
I purchased the NewAir ACP1000E about a year ago.  It was easy to install and works very well. The compressor went out on our main unit and this small unit has been a lifesaver. With the humidity so high, the dehumidification feature was very much appreciated.  Also, due to the current heat wave in the pacific NW, I bought another one a few days ago for my mother in law who lives up in Portland.  Because they're experiencing record temperatures up there, they needed something quick and have no central AC installed in their house.  Air-n-water was able to offer expedited shipping on this unit at a reasonable cost and my mother in law received it the very next.  Overall, if you need something that will cool a bedroom or small living room down, this AC will do the job but don't expect it to cool your entire house down, these portable units aren't meant for that.

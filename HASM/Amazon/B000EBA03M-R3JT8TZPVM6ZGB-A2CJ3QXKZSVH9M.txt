Title: an excellent camera, but with long-term issues
Content:
I bought a slightly used (display model) Olympus E-500 2.5 years ago and have been extremely happy with the results. The battery life continues to be excellent even after constant use (almost daily for 2.5 years). The picture quality is excellent, even with flash in low light (but not very low light) conditions.
HOWEVER, this camera is starting to have small focusing problems (feels like sometimes it doesn't want to take the photo) and a red line now appears on all low-light photos. I would reccomend this camera whole heartedly to anyone, but be aware that it will not last as long as you would like. I would think that for the price I would get at least 4-5 years out of it. My last Olympus was bought in 2002 and still works well.

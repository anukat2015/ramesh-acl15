Title: Nice Digital Camera to upgrade over point and shoot
Content:
This is my first adventure in the field of SLR photography. This camera offers an unbeatable combination of performance, ease-of-use and value. It provides 10.1-megapixel CMOS sensor plus a host of new features including an easy to view 2.5-inch LCD monitor. It is extremely light weight and has an ergonomic body.
The EOS has a very high-precision 9-point AF system for speedy, (close to 2 frames per second) and accurate focusing in any situation. Great for sport events. 
The only down side is that the battery is somewhat smaller than its rival's, and can drain faster due to the large 2.5 inch LCD monitor being on all of the time and the lens in the kit are okay, though I think it is a step below the camera.

Title: LCD does not display in full-automated mode.
Content:
Please be aware that the LCD does not display in full-automated mode. You have to look at your subject using viewfinder, or switch to one of the manual mode settings in order to see your subject in the LCD. This is my first digital SLR, so I do not know if all SLR's behave this way or not. If I knew before hand that I would not be able to use the LCD display to take pictures in automated mode then that would have been a powerful argument not to buy this.

Title: A  Devil of a Vacuum
Content:
We have a smaller home with hardwood and slate floors ( that I installed myself ). So wanted a flexible and easy to use machine.  the DDV (DirtDevilVision) hits the spot in most areas. We love the continuously adjustable speed making it easy to vacuum draperies, throw carpets etc without sucking them up!. The speed adjustment is right under your thumb and easy to adjust. The sound level is also pleasantly the quietest of any vacuum we've used.  Its easy to move about and the auto-rewind-power cord is just perfect.  Our only complaints are a the dirt container is a bit small and messy to empty completely and b. the accessory clip is on the wand! What WERE they THINKING - accessories are hard to fit to it and constantly catching on items, so we quickly abandoned use of THAT feature. Else its a nice machine for the money. Caution: if you really need suction, go get your shop vac :-).

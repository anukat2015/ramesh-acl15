Title: A Mighty Fine Machine
Content:
This coffee maker is a keeper.  It seems durable and has all the bells and whistles one needs.  Gone are the days when I'd set the timer and wake up to a big fat mess on the counter.  The wife claims the cause was the nitwit operator, but what does she know.  Anyway, I've been using this hummer for about two months now--error free.  Coffee ain't bad either.  ch  1/30/2003.  UPDATE AS OF 11/13/2006:  THE COFFEE MAKER STILL WORKS FLAWLESSLY. GREAT PRODUCT.  CH

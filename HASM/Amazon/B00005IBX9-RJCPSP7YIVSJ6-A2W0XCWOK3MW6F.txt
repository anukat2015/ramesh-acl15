Title: Makes a Good Cup of Joe
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for over a year and it works fine. It makes good coffee and looks good on the counter. 
Pros
Good coffee
Water filter
Came with a gold filter
Con
Hard to pour water in and you have to peer into it (we sometimes use a flashlight) to know when it is full.
Have to replace the water filter
Says needs cleaning after only a few brews

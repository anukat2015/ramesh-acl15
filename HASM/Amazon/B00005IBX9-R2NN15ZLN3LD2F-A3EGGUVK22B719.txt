Title: Finally!!!  Really  Great  Coffee!!!!
Content:
I am IN LOVE with this coffee maker! Not only does it look great, but it makes the best coffee I have ever had. We are coffee lovers, & really look forward to that first cup in the morning. I have no problem at all with the smaller well that this pot has. The coffee comes out nice & hot the way we like it. Because of the Charcoal filter, the coffee has a really &quot;clean&quot; fresh taste. I love the little &quot;beep&quot; that calls you when the coffee is done. It is solid & well made. The carafe is a nice sturdy pot. The lid doesn't fall off like it does in some models. It may be pricey to some, but the taste is worth it.I recommend this pot to any one who is a true coffee lover. Bravo Cuisinart!!

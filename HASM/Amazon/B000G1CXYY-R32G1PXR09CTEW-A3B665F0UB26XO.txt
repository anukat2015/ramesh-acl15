Title: Exactly what I wanted.
Content:
This DeLonghi heater is what I expected.
+ small
+ two heat setting (plus fan only)
+ heats quickly
+ low price
The thermostat doesn't wrok very well because it has to heat up a lot before it shuts off, then cool down a lot to come back on.  However, I don't really care bacause I just have it for my cubical at work so I control it manually.  The two heat setting are nice because I can turn it to full heat to warm up fast, then to half heat to keep it warm.

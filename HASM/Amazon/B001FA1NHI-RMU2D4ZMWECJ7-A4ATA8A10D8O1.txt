Title: Can't put the down the volume as much as I want.
Content:
Yesterday I bought an iPod 4th generation. I was very happy with my old iPod but sadly it broke. Anyway, after I was happy with my new 4th generation iPod I wanted to fall asleep and listen to some songs. Here I got my problem. If I put the volume of hte ipod down the music is still very loud. Too loud to fall asleep with.
I called the support hotline and they said it was a hardware problem. So the next day I went to the store any brought the iPod back. They gave me a new one. As soon as I put new songs on there I realized that it had the same problem. I walked back to the store to get my money back. I didn't want to have a another one from that store.
After I walked to another store to buy my iPod there I figured out that it also had the problem and that I also couldn't put down the volume there almost all the way.
I called the support. What they said now was that this was no bug/error but a feature.
I'm very disappointed. My iPod I could put on the volume I wanted. Why does Apple those things to it's customers? I hope that they are going to come up with a software update that resolves the problem.
In the last days I brought THREE iPods home. The employees at the store also believed it that to be a bug/error. After I brought them the second iPod back they even thought about contacting Apple to tell them that they got a whole series of broken iPods.

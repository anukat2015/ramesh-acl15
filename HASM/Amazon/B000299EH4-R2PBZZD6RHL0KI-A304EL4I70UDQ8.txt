Title: And then there was silence...
Content:
I bought this MP3 player and was initially satisfied with it.  It held 1,000+ songs and fit unnoticed in my pocket.  The only complaint is that in the duration of it's working life, if I were to transfer full-length albulms, the player would organize it in alpha order and not in the order of the CD. Three months later and out of the blue, the damn thing stopped working for no apparent reason.  There is no point in trying to repair it because I've tried everything; it's dead and buried.

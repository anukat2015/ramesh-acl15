Title: Great little Notebook
Content:
I already have more than enough notebook computers but wanted a decent 12" unit w/o paying 2 grand for a SONY. Purchased the Everex SA2053T and find it a great tool. First off I ordered a 2 Gig Ram the same time I ordered the Notebook and they both came the same day. Polar Assets had a Polar 2GB DDR2-5300 (667MHz) SoDIMM for about $35. Unscrewed the back panel (don't lose the small screws). Replace the 1 gig with the 2 gig. Reboot. Using heavy tools like VS2008 with no problem. While the screen is small it is clear at the highest res 1280 by 800 and the keyboard is adequate for my medium sized hands. The 2 batteries are a bonus and you will want to carry the extra one on trips because the battery drain is about 2 hours for the larger battery (but I haven't totally conditioned the batteries yet). I also use the unit as a giant iPod channeling Yahoo Music Jukebox into my 5.1 Receiver. Heck, this little powerhouse is only 12" across and at $550-600 depending on where you get it - worth the bucks.

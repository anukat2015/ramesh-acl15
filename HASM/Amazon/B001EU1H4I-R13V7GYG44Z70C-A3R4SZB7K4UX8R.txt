Title: Buyer beware
Content:
Firstly the design was an excellent idea, looked good, saved a ton of space. However. The first one we bought ran exactly one pot of water through it and it went dead with a faint smell of electric burning. I returned it and bought another, this time from sears. Mounted it, put in my first water batch and exactly the same thing. I visited other sites and found the same experience, sometimes immediately, sometimes after several months. One person took it apart and found the circuit board behind the buttons fried. I really wanted this coffee maker but I'm not willing to bring yet another home, have it work for a few months or worse, to just after the warranty. Just wanted to put this info out there so you are aware there is an issue with the electronics design.

Title: A Kitchen Essential
Content:
I received my first Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage Maker in 1977, as a holiday gift from co-workers. It was harvest gold, so I replaced it about 10 years later with a white one when I updated my life.  It never wore out. Now, about 20 years later, I just replaced the white Hot Shot with a new white one, because the lid latch finally wore out--the main functions were still working fine.  I use the Hot Shot daily to heat water quickly for tea, soup, hot chocolate, and many other things.  I do not know what I would do without it.  I have given Hot Shots to everyone in my family over the years, and (like me) they all have found it to be one of the most useful gifts they ever received. It is lightweight and compact, so it can even be taken on trips for use in hotel rooms or when staying with friends.

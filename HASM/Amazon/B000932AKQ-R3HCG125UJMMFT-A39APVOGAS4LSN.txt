Title: New iPod 20GB Color, is it reliable?
Content:
The hottest electronic item on the market!!
   IS NOT RELIABLE.
Less than 1 month and the click wheel is faulty.  Glad I got Apple Care.  This is the 3rd iPod bought in my household, 4th return for service in 8 months
- Click wheel twice
- Disk drive once
- Battery once
Some are lucky, I know 2 iPod ownwers with no problems after 1 year.  Think before you roll the dice.  Apple Care is a must.

Title: Excellent little heater
Content:
Got this heater a few days ago, and it's been great to have during the minus-Zero degree tempertures we're having in Chicago. I'm using this little heater to warm a 500 square foot studio apartment with an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling windows on the 35th floor of a Chicago skyscraper (Goldberg's famed 'Marina Towers'). 
My only complaint was that one of the holes for attaching the stand/wheels seemed to be missing threads and so the attaching screw would not snug up tight. Since this heater adapts itself so easliy to wall-mounting, and comes with all the hardware needed to do that, this little hottie will be going onto the wall later this week. 
Most surprising was the weight--it seems to weigh less than a 5-pound bag of sugar (or a volume of anything written by Tolstoy).  :-)

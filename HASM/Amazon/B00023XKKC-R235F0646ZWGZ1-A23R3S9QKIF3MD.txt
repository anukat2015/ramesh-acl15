Title: Does what its suppose to do very well
Content:
I have this unit for over a year (14 months). Bought it at another outfit (Costco) and use it to cool a my basement where I have my computer systems. The unit performs as as described. Keeps the whole area quite cool. Once i accidently set the heat and I can attest that it does that quite well. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it all of a sudden stopped working. Of course, naturally it stopped after the 1 year warranty. Searching for answers and help is almost next to none until I found the reviews here and noticed that the some were saying that the water tray may be full. So I drained it and bingo it started up again without any hesitation. So if it wasn't for the moment of thinking I would have to go out and get another one or find some service center to fix it, and now have to keep an eye out when the water collector gets full, I would have given it a 5 star.

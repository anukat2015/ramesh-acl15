Title: THIS IS A USER-FRIENDLY COFFEE MAKER!
Content:
We're a bed and breakfast, so we're probably tougher on a coffee maker than the average household - we make a LOT of coffee!  After our last pair gave up the ghost, we did a lot of research, both at retail and online, before committing our money to the replacements.  One of the big things other reviewers had right about this one and similar units is that the self-contained grinder is more hassle (cleaning is a chore on those)than it's worth.  Get a separate grinder, and let the coffee maker do what it's supposed to do - make coffee.  This one does it very well, and we appreciate the graduated water well, easy-to-use cone filter basket, and the easy on-the-front controls.  To be honest, we don't use the timer, becaue we're up early anyway, and we prefer to grind and brew the coffee just before guests are due to arrive in the dining room.  This unit actually cost us less than lesser versions available at retail (this is available only online, as I recall), and the quality appearance is a plus, since image is important in our business.  A little thing, but also important in our use, is the very "positive" hold of the carafe while it's on the (adjustable-temperature) hot plate; unlike previous coffee makers, we don't worry about the carafe accidentally slipping off the plate to spill or break.  We are very pleased with these, and would gladly buy the same ones again.  Hope this helps you.

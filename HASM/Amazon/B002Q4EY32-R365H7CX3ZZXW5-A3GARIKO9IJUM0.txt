Title: Excellent Quality Iced Tea Maker
Content:
I bought mine at Sam's Club but the machine is the same as listed here.  I have used it for the last 2 months without any mechanical problems and have been very impressed with the quality of tea it makes.  For the 1st time in my life, I feel I have a machine that is on par with the quality of coffee makers...something iced tea makers have never been (previous purchases made of plastic with plastic pitchers that melt in the dishwasher, etc...).  The pitcher is thin glass but has not cracked or broken on me...though I'm not concerned as the design of the tea maker is such that any pitcher can be used to replace the current one (as opposed to other tea makers out on the market that require their specific designed pitchers).
Overall, very pleased!

Title: MP3 Player Nirvanna
Content:
If you are looking for a small MP3 player to use while at the gym or running then this is a pretty close to a perfect choice.  It is barely larger than a quarter and has a clip built in.  The controls are simple and can be operated easily while you are in the middle of a workout.
The battery life is so long that I don't even think about whether i have a charge...it has never been an issue.  I can fit many hours of songs on the player but I generally use playlists of 30-40 songs that I create in iTunes.
The sound is good, the controls are easy and the size is right.  I'm not sure how Apple could even improve on this product.  The only thing you might want to do is look at different headphones.  I find that the earbuds pop out too easily during strenuous activity and I opt for the wraparound headphones (I use the Philips SHS3200/37).

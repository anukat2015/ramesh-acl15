Title: It Froze!
Content:
It was a really nice player.  I used for about 3 weeks and it worked fine.  But then one day I tried turning it off and it froze.  I reset it and whenever I tried to turn it off again it froze.  And it froze when I tried to use it.  I ended up returning it.
I don't think I did anything wrong that would cause it to freeze.  I was sure to follow all the directions.

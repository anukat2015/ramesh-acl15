We use ours to heat a fairly large bedroom, and it works well here in Texas, where it rarely gets below 45 or so. We use it along with a ceiling fan to distribute the warm air, then set the thermostat when we're comfortable and turn off the fan. If the furnace has been off all day, it takes about an hour to warm the room. Easy to use, safe, efficient ... my only issue is with the racket it makes when cycling the heating element on and off; hence the 4 stars. If it worked silently, I'd give it 5.

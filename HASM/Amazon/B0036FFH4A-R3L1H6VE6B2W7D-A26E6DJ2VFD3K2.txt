The review below mine is perfect not much to add but I do find it works perfectly with most games.
If you need any help with a gateway laptop there is a forum for this and other models at [..]
We have all the drivers and setups as well including adding bluetooth internally or adding a eSATA port. 
Admittedly the graphics are a tad lack luster since they are Integrated Intel. But this will not impact any thing other than gaming. I use the HDMI and VGA out to output full 1080p to my 50' Tv and its flawless. 
As far as gaming I currently run things such as:
Torchlight              at Max graphics settings
Prototype               at Mid graphics settings
Batman: Arkham Asylum   at Mid graphics settings
Resident Evil 5         at Mid graphics settings
MLB2K10                 at max graphics settings
Spore                   at max graphics settings
The Sims 3              at Max graphics settings
Street Fighter 4        at Max graphics settings
Borderlands             at Mid graphics settings
Corel Draw              Runs smooth
Photoshop 3             Runs Smooth
I am a casual gamer and i find it runs everything I need.

Title: Not perfect...
Content:
What I can say is that this is a good heater, but not quite what I was expecting.  I also own a Vortex VH2 Vortex Heater which is basically the same model but without the digital thermostat, and white (or beige) in color instead of black.  To me the VH2 works very well and is really quiet.  I find that the DVH is much noisier in comparison.  The heating capacity of both of them is rated the same.  I don't see any difference between the two models in that sense.  They both do a very good heating job and seem well built.
Another thing that I don't like about the DVH is that it doesn't have the option of displaying temperatures in degrees Celsius, only in Fahrenheit.  This obviously is not a problem for customers in the US, but elsewhere we would appreciate having the option of choosing a more familiar temperature scale, just as in almost any other electronic device nowadays.
I find that basically everything else that has been said in other thoruogh reviews about this item is correct.  I just wanted to point out these two issues that had not been discussed.

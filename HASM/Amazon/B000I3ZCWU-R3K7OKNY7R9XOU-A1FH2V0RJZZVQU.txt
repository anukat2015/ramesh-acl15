Title: Excellent Image Quality in med to bright light.
Content:
Excellent Image Quality in med to bright light.
First of all I was a Nikon fan. My old Nikon 12 yrs old FM10 worked fine and produced great results for a hobby photographer like me until it fell down from hand. Bought XTi after doing lot of research in different web site such as [...], Cameralab etc. I short listed XTi from Nikon D40X, D60 and also D80. Rejected D80 due to over saturation & color inaccuracy. I pulled over 100s of photos from pbase.com and many diff sites for all these cams to verify. Image quality was my primary concern.
+ve:
Very accurate colors in bright light. Outdoor images looks excellent on my Sony LCD.
Saturation is the BEST.
Very sharp image with proper focus.
Its price right now.
-ve:
Auto mode works fine in bright light only.
Slightly yellowish image in low light in all WB options. Not sure is it due to CMOS sensor? It appears that red tone is more is low light, which can be removed using supplied software to give a natural look.
Battery life is short.
Low light images are noisy too.
I rated 4 stars only as I am not 100% happy with the auto mode and low-light images. I would recommend D60 or Sony DSLR for point-and-shoot up grader if color accuracy and saturation is not a problem OR wait for XSi.
Good Luck

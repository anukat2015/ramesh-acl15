Title: Awesome Coffeemaker
Content:
Once upon a time I had a hand-me-down, ancient Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. It made the best coffee ever, and I thought it was because *I* made the best coffee ever. That coffeemaker died after a combined 20+ years of service in my mother's house, and my first few apartments. I went through a series of replacements, none of which survived more than a year and all of which made HORRID coffee.  I got this one for Christmas two years ago. 700 pots of coffee later I can honestly say this coffeemaker is BETTER than the Mr. Coffee it replaced. The single greatest feature is the "aroma" button, which lengthens the brew cycle, making richer, more flavorful coffee. It has just the right balance of bells and whistles and simplicity. I've experienced none of the problems other reviewers listed and chalk them up to user error rather than design flaws. I love this coffeemaker.

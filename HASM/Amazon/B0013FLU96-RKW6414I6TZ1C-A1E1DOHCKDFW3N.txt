Title: It Screams!
Content:
I'm moving from a Macbook Pro 17" 2.16 Ghz with 2 MB ram to this machine with 4 GB of ram.  It has exceeded my expectations.  I'm using it with Aperture 2, Photoshop CS3, and Lightroom....all open at the same time.  The machine is a joy to use and is significantly faster than my prior Macbook Pro 17".  It's highly recommended.

Title: Very bad unit and customer service.  Do not buy anything from AMCOR
Content:
Unit worked for 2 months.  I ran it only at night. It started to make a rattling sound and went dead.  Called Amcor customer service.  I was told someone would called me in 3-4 business days.  Meanwhile it is 114 degrees in the desert.  I was contacted in that time frame.  They determined that the unit would have to be replaced but I had to pay $90.00 for shipping of the new unit and return of the broken unit.  New unit arrived in 5 days.  It does not work!This is on a Thursday.  It is 110 in the desert.   I called customer service and they tell me that the error code it is giving me can be reprogramed.  Some one will call me by 2:30pm that day or 9am Friday.  No calls ever come.  It is now the following Tuesday and still no calls.  I have called everyday.  Customer support says they are sorry.  They have refered my case to their corporate office to have someone call me as they do not have the information to reprogram my unit. They don't care that it will be 108 here again today. I should have just bought a Sears model

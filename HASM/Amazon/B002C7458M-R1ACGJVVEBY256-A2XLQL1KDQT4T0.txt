This is the best Apple Laptop I have owned. It is capable of any task. The long battery is a welcomed feature. My last Apple Laptop only had a 3.5 hr battery or less and I usually couldn't get a movie in on one charge. But with this new one I can get almost 2 movies in with a fully charged battery. I am also a college student so having the 7 hour battery is great for studying in the library and not having to take my charge cable with me. 
I am absolutely in love with the mid-2009 uMBP.
Don't forget if your a student looking to get an Apple Computer they offer generous education discounts.

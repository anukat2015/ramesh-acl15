Title: BEST IPOD OUT THERE!
Content:
I am very happy with the ipod nano. It's very small, light weight and holds a lot of songs. There are other features such as a calendar, photos, games, etc, but I mainly use it for the music. I wasn't eager to get an ipod when they first came out but I started to want one recently. I'm glad I waited because I got a better version and for a more reasonable price.

Title: Outstanding Product!
Content:
My family has really enjoyed this little heater.  We have been able to turn the house temperature down significantly.  Then use this little guy to only heat the room that we are in.  In our first bill the increase to our electric was completely outweighed by the decrease in cost of our gas bill. This will have paid for itself in only 2 months!
I did note that another reviewer mentioned that it had an exceptionally hot cord.  This did greatly concern me about the products safety.  I have repeatedly checked the cord due to this concern and at no time has the cord been anything but lukewarm at best.  Even after multiple hours of use. 
Pros:
1.  Heats a room very quickly!
2.  It oscillates spreading the heat.
3.  Temperature control by degree.
4.  Remote control.
5.  Saved money!
Cons:
1.  As another reviewer mentioned if it had a fan feature it would be really nice!
All in all worth every penny and was worth it even without the fan feature.

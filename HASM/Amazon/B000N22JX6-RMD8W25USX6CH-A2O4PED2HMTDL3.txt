Title: Works great
Content:
I use this in a basement guest bedroom.  It heats up a 10x12 room fine.  The remote is great for my guests; they can climb in bed, read a little bit, and then turn it off without having to get up. I like the oscillating feature and it is compact and attractive which was important to me as well.

Title: Great camera
Content:
This is a great camera, it takes good pictures and I love how it captures the colors. It's more than fast enough to take pictures of fast subjects such as two three month old puppies. It would be nice if it had a way to preview the changes made to aperture, but I'm getting a sense of what aperture and shutter speed works without the preview. Some people who have used my camera think that it doesn't feel heavy enough either, but I actually find that makes it easier to use. It's probably a good idea to go to the store and try holding one before you decide if that is going to bother you or not. The settings are also pretty easy to use after you get used to them, easier than my parents point and shoot canon.

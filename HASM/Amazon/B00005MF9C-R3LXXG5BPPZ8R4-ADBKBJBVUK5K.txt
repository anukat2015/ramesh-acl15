Title: Satisfied
Content:
Great for one drinker per household. Perfect for my needs.  Glad I got it, use it every day.
Pros: Brews very fast, very hot.  No purchasing of filters.  No pot, brews right into the drinking cup. Makes just the right amount.
Cons: Cup's external temp can be hot to the touch...but bearable for me.

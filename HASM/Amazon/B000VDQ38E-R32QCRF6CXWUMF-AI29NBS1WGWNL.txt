Title: Gotta love the Bissells!
Content:
I purchased my Bissell on 2/23/2010 b/c my other Bissell had, had enuff (: I vacuum EVERY day b/c Im OCD about it. I also have 2 dogs in my home now, a Boston Terrier and a labradoodle so getting something that was for pet hair was a MUST! I LOVE the vacuum cleaner! Picks up soooooo much that it's almost made me wanna rip the carpet out and put down hardwoods b/c of all the stuff it's pulling out. It's crazy! My 2 downfalls on this machine is 1~ DEFF a lil heavier! My other bissell was also heavy, but I believe this one may havea few pounds on it. 2~ LIL messier than my previous bissell. BUT would I buy again....ABSOLUTELY! 2 have a wonderful vacuum to do the job for this price...you cant beat it. I never seem to have a bagless that lasts longer than a year...so Im quite curious if this one will either, but you have to realize they are deff tested here (I also have 2 kids). Would deff recommend. Dont look for some miracle magic hair/dust eraser..Im sorry you'll never find one (I owned a Kirby and even they didnt get EVERYTHING). Pretty darn good vacuum....and even better for the price! (:

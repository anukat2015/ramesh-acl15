Title: Long-term review of the Hoover S3755
Content:
This is a long-term review, as I have had this unit for a little over 5 years now.  I understand there's a 'digital' model that succeeds this, and the accessories for it would probably make it a better buy but I believe the overrall 'guts' and construction are the same, so this review would probably be relevent. For the 5+ years I have used S3755 I've encountered two problems (one major & one minor): (1) the power cord to the drive/brush mechanism had a short in it and went inoperative after 4 years.  It was traced to the 'yoke assembly' and required a ~$75 repair buy a local sew/vac shop. (2) The quick-detach mechanism that detaches the power brush from the wand cracked.  The spring to apply tension to the QD ball was made of plastic, and not a metal leaf-spring like you'd expect! 
Because of these 2 problems, I downgraded it to 4 stars, but I WOULD buy this vacuum again, considering its a good value and it gets used 1-2 times/week in my household.

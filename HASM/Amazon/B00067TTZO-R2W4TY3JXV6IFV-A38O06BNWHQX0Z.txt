Title: Better than a Ipod Mini, imho
Content:
Just got it for Father's Day.  Like this a lot more than a mini (which met an untimely death on my driveway).  The Ipod is fantastic hardware and poor software as long as you try anything instead of iMusic.  This synchs with the Yahoo music, Napster, which is much easier than transferring from your CD's.
Replaceable batteries, actually seems smaller than the mini.

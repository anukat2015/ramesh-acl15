Title: Alarm feature
Content:
This heater seems to be a great buy, but after some use, the alarm comes on from time to time.  Then it comes on and stays on, even after unplugging the heater. It is a waste of money for me.  I do not understand why this thing does not reset itself.  I google troubleshooting the thing and was disappointed to find that you had to have some "handyman" knowledge to attempt to check it.  Otherwise it is suggested to replace it.
Some Deal:(

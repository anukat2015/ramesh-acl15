Title: Works like a Charm!
Content:
We were having a family party and my old white Kitchen Aid coffee maker croaked.  My husband brought home this Red KitchenAid 14 cup Coffeemaker and it was the hit of the party(All Swedes love their coffee)!  I like that I can make just 4 cups vs. 14 cups.  It's very easy to keep clean, maintain and use.

Title: Apple Ipod
Content:
I bought this item, an Apple iPod Nano, 8gb, for Our Grandson for a Christmas gift.  He was thrilled!!  I was too, when it came, as it was packaged in it's original packaging, came with all of the usual accessories and arrived in plenty of time.  I have ordered iPods before from Amazon, as well as various other products, and have never been dissappointed....nor have had any problems of any sort.

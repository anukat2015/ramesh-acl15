Title: LOVE THIS VAC!
Content:
I really think this vacuum is wonderful. I don't like bags and I found this one better than my last bagless, which was a Kenmore upright. It has alot of power and it is very easy to vacuum up the stairs (so much easier than an upright). The power switches at the top of the handle are extremely easy to use. I like the fact that I can vacuum under my bed and get around easier with a canister. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of how often you need to dump it. Even though it is very easy to dump the 'stuff' that you vacuum up, I have to do it atleast two times when I vacuum my house. It is a very minor complaint, because I would buy it again. Although, I think it vacuums so well, it is picking up more than my other vacuum ever did. The compartment should be a bit bigger though. Everything else about it is great.

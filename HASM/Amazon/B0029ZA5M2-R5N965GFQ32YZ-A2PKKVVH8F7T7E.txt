Title: Bad Buy
Content:
We bought 2 of these computers for my daughters who are in college and high school. We have a home network that we  have 4 other computers set up on, and at this point, 2 weeks later, still can't get these to keep an internet connection. Have spent hours on the phone with HP help... who apparently can't help us get online either. We both work with computers for a living, and have had 4 or 5 computers all networked together through our MAC timecapsule, and have never had an issue of any kind. I was trying to save money, and get a good deal, but I ended up spending money we didn't have, on computers that don't work. If I had to do it over, would spend the extra money and get a MAC. This was a terrible purchase.

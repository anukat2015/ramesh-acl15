Title: Waited for a whole year before I bought this but was devastated with the frequent errors and freezes
Content:
The Camera would have received a 5 star rating for everything else but one thing that ruins everything for me is the error that it comes up with very frequently and completely hangs. 
It's been 3 weeks with the camera with infrequent use and it has already  frozen 5 times so far which required me to remove the battery to rest the same. I also own a Nikon N70 and my brother owns a Nikon D70 and they both have no issues. So it is surprising that I am now the owner of a product that is probably poorly constructed. I initially thought that it could be a software bug but it appear more like a manufacturing defect now.

Update 27th Oct, 2009: I will be receiving my replacement kit tomorrow. I am hoping that I will not have issues with the same. Fingers crossed.

Title: Really saves on energy
Content:
Been using this to heat my 10x16 workshop and it has been doing a great job, was using a coil style heater before and that thing seemed like it was running constantly this one doesn't and I just have it set to keep it at the 40 degrees to keep my stuff from freezing, when I go out there and want to work I turn it up and I swear in 5 minutes it has it up to 65+ Would definitely recommend this heater to others.
However as far as using it in the home I wouldn't it gets to hot to touch the front so I would not trust it around combustibles its probably fine but I am paranoid :)

Title: Save your Money and Buy a Mr. Coffee!
Content:
I have owned several upscale coffee makers and budget friendly coffee makers in the past and was anxiously looking forward to my new Capresso.  I am very disappointed in this product for the following reasons:  
- Coffee maker is supposed to brew hot coffee and the thermal caraffe is supposed to keep it hot.  The coffee is no hotter than a $15 coffee maker and the caraffe doesn't keep it hot enough to the 2nd cup. Even in as short of a timespan of 10 minutes from first to second cup we have to reheat the coffee.
- Coffee maker is a mess!  The caraffe lid drips when pouring no matter how you turn the lid to pour.  If you open it one revolution it spills all over the counter and this happens no matter how little or how much you open the lid.
- Caraffe is difficult to open and close.  Lid doesn't turn smoothly and doesn't rotate easily.
- The coffee is weak.  I use the same amount of the same ground beans that we have used for years with other machines and for some reason the coffee is still weak. This is another design flaw in how the water is dispersed over the basket or filter.
- The coffee is supposed to brew quickly; 8 minutes for a full pot.  Ours takes 15 minutes and we've only owned it for 2 weeks so there is no built up sediment, etc.
Please save your money or use the money you were going to spend on this coffee maker and buy something else.  You'll be glad you did!

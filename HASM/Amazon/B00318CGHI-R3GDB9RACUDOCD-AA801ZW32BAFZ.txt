Title: It is just what i expected
Content:
I bought this computer like about two months ago; so far it is just what I expected. It is not designed for gamming or complex graphic resolution, Windows 7 works fine (way better that Vista) and it feels kind of slow every now an then. I still have to check if that is because my internet connection or any internal process running, but as I said it is just what I expected. This is more for a normal use computer.

Title: Trust the 1 star reviews
Content:
When I ordered this, I saw 3 1-star reviews. I went ahead and ordered because I don't have any pets and this is the only canister with power nozzle in my budget. I was totally wrong! Packing is very poor, machine is very loud, heavy to carry around, and **doesn't not pick up** what I wanted to clean on the carpet. Dust won't stay in the dustbin, rather made themselves balls in the filter. So when I emit the dust, there was no dust in the bin. I had to pull the dust balls from filter. Very messy and time consuming!! I cannot turn the machine off from handle, rather walk to the main machine and turn off. Roller is so small. Do yourself a favor by not buying this awful machine. You'll be happy to avoid to hassle return (Amazon wanted me to take it back to post office and will reimburse up to $20). Not sure it is enough for postage.

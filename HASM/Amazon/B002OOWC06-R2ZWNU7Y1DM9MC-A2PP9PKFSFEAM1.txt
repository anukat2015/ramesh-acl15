Title: Overheated right out of the box.
Content:
We were in the market for a lightweight, decently spec'd laptop as a graduation gift for our high schooler.  We presented her with her cool new laptop however we were all quickly disappointed as the laptop immediately began displaying error messages about overheating and then subsequently turning off.  We returned the laptop to Amazon and purchased a Sony from Costco instead as we didn't have faith in the durability of this particular laptop.  Be advised that when you return a laptop to Amazon it can take a month or more to get your money refunded which seems ridiculous to me. I purchase from Amazon all the time however I would have had less of a hassle purchasing locally from the start.

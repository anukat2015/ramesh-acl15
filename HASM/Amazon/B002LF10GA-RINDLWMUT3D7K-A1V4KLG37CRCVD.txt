Title: Netbook no more
Content:
I've had this little machine since it's been out (3 weeks) and it's been absolutely a great surprise. Again like many of the reviewers have mentioned, the performs is much better than your average atom netbook. I had the ASUS 1005HA and although that netbook may be cheaper with a longer batter, it comes with a smaller screen, lower resolution, no windows 7 upgrade, and it is not as fast. I feel that even vista runs well with this acer and that can't be said for some desktops. The battery life is great (about 6 hours for simple surfing web and word processing) and the system is light, battery does not stick out, keyboard feels great, and very thin to make portability a key characteristic. 
My only complaint would be the glossy lid (glossy screen is not as bad as some ppl say) and the small trackpad. The trackpad is hard to differentiate and is made of that brushed plastic that creates a lot of friction and resistance on days where your finger may not be smooth (such as hot days). If you dont' enable two finger scrolling with the updated drivers, scrolling becomes difficult because its hard to tell where the edges are. Other than these complains, this little computer is everything you could wish for in an ultraportable at an amazing price to boot. Don't expect this to replace your desktop or to run intensive games and applications. but if you keep your expectations down, you will be very very pleased.

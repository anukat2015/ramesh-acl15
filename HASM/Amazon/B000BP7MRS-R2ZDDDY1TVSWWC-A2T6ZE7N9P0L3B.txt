Title: Braun are the best coffee makers
Content:
Braun KF590 Impressions Digital 10-Cup Programmable CoffeemakerWe have tried many coffee makers. Seems the newer ones are all show - they look good on the counter but they either wear out fast or develop mold problems in the tank. This Braun relpaced a Cuisenart that ground the coffee for you. Nice while it lasted but just was not up to the task. Fortunately we did not get rid of an old -15 yrs - Braun we stashed in the attic. We purchased the KF590 and it is a pleasure. Sorry to hear that Proctor and Gamble (Braun's new owners since 2006) are trying to stop Braun sales in the US. You can bypass US distribution and get many Braun products straight from Europe - just need a converter.

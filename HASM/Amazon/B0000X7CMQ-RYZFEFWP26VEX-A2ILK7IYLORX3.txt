Title: Fresh Brew at 6am
Content:
I like the Zojrushi.  The programming is easy and it's really nice to wake up to fresh brewed coffee.  But the really nice aspect is the carafe.  This is a big improvement over it predecessor, a Braun 12 cup which would invaribly burn the coffee if left on the hotplate.  The Zojirushi is not perfect as the coffee is too cool for my liking after an hour or so but 30 seconds in the microwave takes care of that.  The one other sort of negative characteristic is that it is difficult to get the carafe back into the unit.  The carafe is just a milimeter or two too tall and so some force is needed to put it back in the unit, and I have to hold the unit so that it doesn't just move away as I insert the carafe.  But overall, a very good carafe coffee maker.

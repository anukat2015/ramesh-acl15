Title: Smells, no fan means heat goes up and out
Content:
I bought one of these heaters at Joe's and was disappointed to the point that I took it back. I burned through two propane canisters trying to rid the foul, toxic smell - it gave me a huge headache, and that was in my ventilated garage. No way I'm going to run this in a smaller space with my wife and kids. Also, this unit has no fan so there's no way to circulate the heat the element is producing. I could hardly feel the heat a foot in front of the unit because it was all going straight up. Going to try to Coleman Pro Cat next.

Title: Olympus E510 2-lens kit
Content:
This is my third dSLR and the best so far. The camera is packed with features and settings, allowing the user to customize IQ as desired. It produces beautiful, sharp, well saturated images right out of the camera and if you set it right, chances are you will have to do very very little PP (if any at all). The 4/3 system is great. The Zuiko lenses are compact and very light weight. The two-lens kit gives you the most for your money. The WA covers 14-42mm while the tele picks up from 40-150mm. Both lenses are of good quality for being kit lenses (but I believe the old kit lenses, although bigger, are superior in many aspects). Live view is good, however, I would not say it is a must have feature. IS on the other hand, is great to have. It will buy you at least a couple fstops and save you a ton of shots if using the Zuiko 70-300mm (real 140-600mm) hand held. All in all, this is one camera you will love from the get go. Highly recommended.

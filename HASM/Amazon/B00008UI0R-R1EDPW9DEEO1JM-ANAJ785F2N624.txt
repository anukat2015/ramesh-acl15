Title: great vacuum
Content:
This is a great vacuum; I'm able to vacuum my whole house without disconnecting anything.  I can vacuum my hardwood floors and go directly to the carpeted areas with just the press of a button.  By adjusting the suction strength, you can vacuum area rugs without sucking them into the vacuum.  I was amazed at how much dirt was in the canister after the first time I used it.  Lite enough to carry around without much effort.

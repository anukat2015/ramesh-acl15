Title: Great camera
Content:
I bought this camera after months of research as an upgrade from our Canon S2IS. The XTi is much larger than the S2IS and my wife insists she won't be carrying this one. The controls are very easy to operate and well placed. The camera is well balanced and easy to use. The power-on time is amazing and the focus is instantaneous. I'm still learning the different modes and capabilities but I'm very happy with the XTi so far. Understand this is not a point-and-shoot sized camera though. But the images it creates are well worth the extra size and weight. This is the perfect step up for those who are interested in upgrading. It would be a dream first digital camera too!

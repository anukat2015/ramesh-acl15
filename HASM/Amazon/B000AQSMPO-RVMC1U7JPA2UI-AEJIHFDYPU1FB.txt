Title: It Broke
Content:
I liked this machine-- had it over a year and then it stoped working-- lot of money to just huck in the trash.  Also you cant adjust for the size of your coffee mug.  A pricey way to make coffee, the K-cups are a tad expensive and if you drink coffee every day you soon realise you can be spending $60 a month on the k-cups.

Title: Ipod Nano 5th Gen
Content:
I purchased this Nano when I misplaced my second generation Nano. Some improvements but some areas than I still hate. I wish there was a more direct on off button instead of the push for 5 seconds to turn it off. Apple really should start suppling a case for the Nano to use when you workout or on the go. The ear bud really need to be upgraded for comfort and better sound quality.
With that said. during workouts I would be lost without the Nano or the shuffle that I have.

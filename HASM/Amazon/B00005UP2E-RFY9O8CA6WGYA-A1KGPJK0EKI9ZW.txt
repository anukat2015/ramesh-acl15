Title: just  "OK" not great
Content:
Purchased because I wanted a bagless vacuum and something fairly light to carry around a small house and get under furniture. My very good old bagless Sanyo I got for $5 at a yard sale bit the dust when the kitties crashed a piece of furniture onto it (my fault, of course, really). This is pretty good at cleaning but the floor attachment's brush strip grabs the cat hair bunnies and clogs the head rather than sucking it up like the Sanyo did. I may remove the brush strip. Rug attachment likes to keep the cat hair even more, rather than sending it on its way. The most annoying thing is how extremely high-pitched and noisy the motor is. Bottom line is it does the job, with a little nozzle cleaning now and then, so I suppose I will live with it.

Title: Good Heater
Content:
Northern Tool was excellent about replacing the first heater that was sent to us... the fan wouldn't work because it was damaged and hitting the motor. They shipped out a new one and picked up the old one asap. It is a little loud, but it's for a garage, so that is to be expected. Other than that, it has been keeping our 600-square foot home toasty warm, even at 5 below zero.

Title: Yes and No Voranado
Content:
Yes.  It does heat very well, cabinet stays cool.  My problems are:  1)  It interferes with AM radio reception even when in a far away room in the house.  You really cannot listen to any AM station while the heater is on; 2) there are no "grab" handles, only an indentation which make it slippery and hard to grasp to move around.   This is a major drawback for us.  Otherwise it's the best I've ever had, heating-wise.

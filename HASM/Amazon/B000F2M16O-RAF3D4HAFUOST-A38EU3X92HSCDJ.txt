Title: So far great coffee and experience
Content:
The drip coffee is excellent.  I love the programmable timer and ease of making coffee and cleaning.  The machine is quiet and makes coffee very quickly.
The espresso maker is great.  The machine makes excellent espresso with espresso beans, I repeat here, espresso beans. It is also quiet, which I really like! There were a couple of tricks I had to learn - one is to make sure that the "taste" dial is not positioned all the way to "strong" otherwise the espresso machine skips making espresso and instead sends the steam to the foamer.  I like the foamer but it is a bit particular. First, it must be cleaned right away and the foamer does make a bit of a mess all over on the inside of the unit - milk seems to bubble out and go under the removable milk compartment and get into hard to reach places to clean. Second, the foamer works well with skim milk or 2% but not so well with whole milk - this is stated in the instructions as well.  I love whole milk in my cappucino so that was a bit of a drawback for me.  
Overall, I have really enjoyed having this machine and look forward to making either coffee or espresso.  It is a bit particular in that everything needs to be exactly right for it to work otherwise issues will arise. I've got it dialed now. I would advise reading instructions all the way through once and look over diagrams, then go back and read instructions and set up new machine step by step. It makes everything easier to understand.

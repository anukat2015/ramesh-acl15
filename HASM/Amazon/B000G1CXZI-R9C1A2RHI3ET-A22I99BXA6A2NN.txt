Title: Great little heater at the right price!
Content:
We did alot of research into the different types and brands of oil filled heaters before we chose this one.  Most of those we found were uninspiring in looks and features, and they were expensive to boot!  They also had the downfall of radiating heat from all sides, something which makes placement of this type of heater sometimes difficult.  When we found this little heater on Amazon, we knew we had finally found the answer to our heater dilemma!  It is very small, but that's exactly what we needed for our spot.  It doesn't act small, however!  It heats the entire room with no problem (a bedroom of approx 200sf) even on the lowest setting.  It did smell the first night, but we've had no problem with an odor since.  What clinched our decision to get this model versus all the other models out there had to do with its vertical chimneys, which direct the heat up rather than out the sides.   It really works!  And I must say, Amazon shipped it to us super fast..we are very pleased with both the product and with Amazon!

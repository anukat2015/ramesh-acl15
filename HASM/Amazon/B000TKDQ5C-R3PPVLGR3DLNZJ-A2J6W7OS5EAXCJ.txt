Title: Once I took it home... I missed it at work.
Content:
I really need something that will keep me warm at work. I work a late shift and the office normally empties out three to four hours before I leave. Without the extra people here there small call center cools quickly. I got this to keep my legs warm, and it would do the job, if it was consistently on.
This lil guy will turn on, and go for a few minutes as it feels like an open campfire 2 inches from your legs, than quickly turn itself back off as soon as you start to warm up. Then you have to adjust it to turn the heat on a higher setting, so your heater will turn back on and continue to provide you with legs that feel almost burned. When you can't tolerate the high heat anymore, as soon as you turn it down then it immediately turns itself onto its sleep like status where its no longer heating. 
I took this heater home, and started using it in my office. We would keep the door shut and it would keep the entire room at a cozy setting. It worked so well I bought another one for my bedroom to keep it warm through out the night, as well as *sigh* I bought one for my office again. I've tried setting it further back and its alright when its not up on you, and I'm wearing thicker socks now so I'm not as cold as before so I use it just a bit less.

Title: Why buy a DX if you can get the D700 FX?
Content:
Well its not cheap, and if you are paying that much for a digital camera then you are serious about your photography. Surely its better than the comparable Canon but as soon as the D700 was released and I cannot stop thinking about upgrading but what would will I do with my 5 DX lenses! I am very disappointed with the noise I get in this camera even in low ISO and the only way to get rid of it is to get a full frame camera.

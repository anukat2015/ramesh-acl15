Title: Defective or just lousy?
Content:
This heater didn't work out of the box. It turned on and got hot but shut itself down almost immediately (certainly not based on the thermostat setting!). It turned on a couple of more times and did the same thing. Hopefully this was a defective unit and not just a crappy product. I chose to return rather than replace and continue to use my ancient B&D that warms the whole room even though it's probably not energy efficient.

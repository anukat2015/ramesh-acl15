Title: Great concept, some thoughts on K-cups
Content:
Overall I'm impressed with this single cup brewing system, seems to be perfect if you're looking to brew a serving or two of coffee. There is no measuring of coffee grinds to water and almost zero clean up. Although there are a decent selection of K-Cups, it seems not all varieties are available in grocery stores yet. Also, the price per cup is higher than your traditional coffee machine but still lower than the coffee shop on your street corner. 
The the digital controls on this are not very intuitive and difficult to navigate. You can indeed brew several cup sizes, set the water temperature (191F max) and set the timer to power on the machine in preparation for brew. You can also set 'auto- power off' feature which is nice if you are on the go. This brewer does look sharp and adds a nice touch to any kitchen. 
Keurig should include the reusable filter with this purchase, I bought it separately for $15. It's basically a plastic attachment piece with a filter basket so you can brew your own coffee grinds.

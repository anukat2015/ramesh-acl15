Title: Great little vacuum!
Content:
We bought this vacuum for the cleaning person to use to clean our retail store and offices once a week and it has really kept up!  She fills a bag each cleaning and says it works great.  I'm thinking of getting one for home.  I've always had Oreck uprights and they are great for the price too but not as versitile as this one.

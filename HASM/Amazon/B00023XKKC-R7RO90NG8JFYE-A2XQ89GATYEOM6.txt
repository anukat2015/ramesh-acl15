Title: when is the class action suit?
Content:
I have a soleus Air 9000 PE2-09R-32. Soleus PE2-09R-32DB 9000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner It worked okay for a year.  Now the drip pan red light comes on everytime I use it.  The design to drain it as noted in other reviews is very poor.  I flooded my carpet the first time I drained it.  The little pan and hose does not give you an indictation of what to expect.  I used the exhaust to dry the rug after.  Since then i've been pushing it outside to drain.  This isn't an easy task and water has been spiling over.  The manuel says not to move it when the pan is full inside.  This was an expensive endeavor. It cannot be run unattended.  I wish the evaporation system worked.  It did work for one season.  Last year I didn't have the light come on to drain it at all.  So what happened?  Did it break?  Could it be fixed? When it did work and I didn't have to drain it -- I would have given it 3 1/2 stars.  It did cool the room and I was able to move it from the bedroom to my office well enough.  This is after modifying the venting system with better insulation on a wood fitting for my window.  Last year -- too much heat was coming back in the room from their window kit.

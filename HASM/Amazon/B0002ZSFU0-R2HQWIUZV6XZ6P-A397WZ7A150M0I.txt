Title: SC-Y120 performs poorly on both bare floors and carpets
Content:
PRO:
- Light
- Modern looking
- It actually has decent vacuuming power
- The spinning 10" brush works extremely well (though unwieldy) in cleaning fine cat's hair in furniture fabric
CON:
- Short cord
- The main attachment (with 10" brush de-activated to clean floors) performs adequately on opened hardwood floors but poorly in the corners due to the bulk of its size. 
- The main attachment (with 10" brush activated to clean carpets) performs poorly on medium height carpet because the air-driven brush does not protrude much beyond the attachment's plastic housing.
- The wand's sections kept getting detach especially when vacuuming on carpet
- The tool holder sometimes gets in the way when vacuuming under the sofa or cabinet
SOLUTION:
- I should have returned the darn thing but decided otherwise because of its cat's hair removal capability - which is WAY better than the heavy Sears' canister and its many attachments
- For Bare Floors: Use the Sears' 6" floor attachment (since both Sanyo wand and Sears' attachment have the same inner diameter, I had to go to Home Depot to find a plastic pipe to make a coupling section)
- For Carpets:  Use the heavy Sears canister!
- Or maybe I would just get rid of both Sanyo vacuum and the cat

Title: Good Idea, Bad Coffee
Content:
This coffee maker has nice looks and doesn't take up much space.  Clean up isn't all that complicated and operation is intuitive.  OneOne falls short where it counts.  I tried a few different pod brands and the coffee was weak; even with the small cup setting and a dark roast pod.  The water resavoir is flimsy and some water is spilled when it has to be removed.  Another downside is that the pump has to be primed if the machine hasn't been used in as little as three days.  Outside of not having to scoop coffee, this machine has nothing over an automatic drip.  If you're still interested in coffee on the go, try the "Melitta Take Two".  You get automatic drip coffee in a convenient to go cup for half the price.

Title: Never buy Black and Decker product again
Content:
I will never buy a Black and Decker product again. Second defective product in 3 months.
Poor customer support - rude agent on the phone. Had product less than 2 months old but they will charge me for a "Warrantee Charge" to exchange. You gotta be kidding! Never again...

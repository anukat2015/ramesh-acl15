Title: Great product with easy installation
Content:
When I moved into my new home, this was one of my first purchases.  I have to say that I could not be more happy with it.  Extremely easy installation and set-up.  It comes with default settings, that will work well for about 95% of people.  For those that want a little bit more personalization (like myself), you can adjust the settings in 5-10 minutes tops, and have the times and temps set to your personal liking.  
Also, as other reviewers have stated, there are a ton of great features that set this apart from other.  Battery on the outside, one touch backlit for the screen, and the ability to set the settings while the unit is not on the wall are the best by far.  A great buy, and highly recommended.

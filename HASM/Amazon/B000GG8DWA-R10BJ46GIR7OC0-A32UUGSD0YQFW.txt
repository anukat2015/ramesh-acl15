Title: good heater
Content:
For those wanting a good basic heater that doesn't use a lot of energy this one fills the bill.  Instead of 750 and 1500 watts this one is 400 and 800 watts due to being a different type of heat.  So if you have older wiring where the other space heaters trip the breaker, this one will be nice for you.

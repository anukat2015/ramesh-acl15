Title: Works well, low price
Content:
I bought this for my relatively small office, which can get quite cold during the winter.  It has very high ceilings, so I was worried the heater might be too small, but it's working like a charm.  Low noise, and I like the different temperature options.  I'd definitely buy it again.

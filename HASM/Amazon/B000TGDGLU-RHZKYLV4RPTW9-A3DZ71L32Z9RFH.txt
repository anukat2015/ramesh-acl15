Title: no timer / stinky
Content:
I had one of these heaters for a few years and wanted to get a second one.  I did not realize that this one does not have a timer, which is very convenient for cold mornings.  I would discourage this heater over one with a timer.  It also had a stinky smell for the first few times it got warm, definitely not that new car smell.

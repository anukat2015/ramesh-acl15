Title: Miss the simple days
Content:
I originally purchased a refurbished Zune from Amazon.  I struggled with it for 2 weeks before sending it back.  The battery would not hold a charge for more than an hour.  I decided to try a new Zune and didn't have any of the problems of the refurbished.
I do miss the simple days of basic dragging and dropping music and playlists all on one screen.  I find the Zune PC software far more complicated than it needs to be, and it is too large to download and run on my netbook.  As far as I can tell, you have to have the software to play the zune on your PC, so that is a bit of a downer.  (I used to have a sony mp3 player, I got used to plug and play)
It is getting tough to find accessories since Target stopped carrying Zune.  But it works fine with universal accessories.
Outside of that,  I am happy with it.  Sturdy, portable, lightweight.  It does everything a mp3 player is supposed to do, and a lot of other fancy stuff that I don't get around to using.  
And it comes with a few nifty games- nice surprise.

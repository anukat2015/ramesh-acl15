Title: Pretty, but horribly designed
Content:
The Ipod is sleek and modern looking.  Appears to be excellently designed.  But, it's not.  The controls are pressure designed and they are awful.  The return-to-the-beginning button is placed too closely to the other buttons, so it is too easy to accidentally press the button and return to the beginning (for example, the beginning of a book if you listen to recorded books).  All buttons are pressure-sensitive, but the pressure does not always work.  For example, you can try to turn the machine off, but pressing on the button sometimes functions normally and at other times you can press the button for minutes, with no response.Do I have a lemon?  No.  I know others who have the identical machine and experience identical problems.This machine is a dud.  It needs major changes in functional design.I recommend against buying the machine.

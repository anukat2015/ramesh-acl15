Title: Works well for its size
Content:
I got this because it has the timer feature, which means it warms up the bedroom while I'm downstairs and goes off in the morning. However, I wish it had an overide switch on the timer because if you want it on at a different time you have to resent all these tiny pins that look like they might break. Better bet is to find a non-digital heater with no timer and get a separate appliance-grade timer ($10 or so) which has a switch you can move independent of the time. However, this puts out a lot of heat for its tiny size and unlike some heaters has three settings - I use just 500 wats most night snad it works great.

Title: Satisfied with Zune
Content:
The price and deilivery of the Zune was just as promised.  The price was cheaper than even major sale prices locally.  As for the functionality of the Zune, you cannot put music bought on iTunes on the Zune. - I understand it is a Microsoft vs Apple deal, but I have bought alot of iTunes music that is on my computer.  If I want that music on the Zune I have to buy them again.  You can share music from one Zune to another which will be nice if many people start buying them.  For right now this feature is not that useful.  The radio feature does have pretty good reception, which is nice.  Overall I like the ease of use and the $90 pricetag was GREAT -especially when compared to the 40GB iPod.

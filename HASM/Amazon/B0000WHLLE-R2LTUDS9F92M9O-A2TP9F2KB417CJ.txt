Title: NC6000 refurbished
Content:
I bought this for my son as a Christmas present for school and for playing his MMORPG games. At first it was ok.  I needed to get a new battery because the one that came with it didn't hold a charge for long. Then I bought more RAM for it because of the gaming part. After that, it was perfect until 2 days ago.  He's only had it not even 2 months and we can't even turn it on now.  The battery won't charge when its plugged in and it wont even run off the power cord.   I paid $300.00 for the laptop itself and threw another $200 - $250.00 getting it ready for him to use it. Looking back, if I knew back then what I know now I would've just bought a new laptop with a warranty since now I have to pay $100.00 just to have HP/Compaq look at it.

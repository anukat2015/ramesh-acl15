Title: bad company
Content:
I have not dealt with a more aggravating company in year. This unit may work for you but on auto mode it runs contentiously in dehumidify mode. Upon calling Soleus tech support I got A woman that did not know anything technical about this unit and refused to transfer me to someone who did. This unit is brand new and the only way I can use it is to run a separate humidifier. I will never buy another product from them again

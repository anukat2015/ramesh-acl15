Title: DeLonghi Mica Heater
Content:
I must say that this is the best heater that I have had so far.  Prior to this I had a noisy ceramic blower, a radiant electric heater (quiet but dangerous) and this one.  In my opinion, this radiator is quiet and extremely effective in heating my bedroom. At least I can sleep without the noise waking me up!  The space saving design is another bonus.  I am considering purchasing another one for another part of the house.  Thank you DeLohngi!

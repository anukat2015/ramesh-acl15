Title: I'm a Canon fan, and was not let down
Content:
I have owned 3 Canons and have always been very impressed with the features and usability.
This camera is no different. 
I've upgraded from the ELPH S500 series (a point-and-shoot) because I felt that I'd learned all I needed to with simpler cameras. I purchased this camera because of the positive reviews (like this one) talking about the wonders of the features. 
While I love this camera, i'll give you the negative bits that I'm always looking for to give a truly balanced opinion on the features of a product; "I love it, I love it, I love it" doesn't convince me of whether I want to purchase it or not.
In no particular order:
Pros:
-physically: it's small, lightweight and while plastic, still feels solid enough to put into my bag.
-coming down in price, the cost of these DSLRs are really moving down.
-wide assortment of lenses from many manufacturers available
-the pictures are, as everyone says, amazing. the colors are rich, the default settings are pretty good in itself. I've toyed with some of the color and sharpness settings and have had good results.
-easy to use, intuitive, the center "set" button is reprogrammable also for easy use of certain features.
-great for beginners, it's designed for the consumer, not pros, and I really have learned a lot from its simplicity. Menus, instruction books, and others are simple to understand.
-Great for beginning and moving up. This is my plan, as I'm finding that photography is a strong passion of mine now. I had noticed that the higher end cameras, the 5D, etc. all use the same lenses, so eventually I'd like to move up. For right now, this camera is awesome.
Cons:
-the size makes it difficult for my hands, I bought an extended battery grip and it fits much better. However, this makes it a bit heavier.
-rear screen is not recessed. this makes me nervous that it's going to get scratched or cracked somehow. wish they'd spent a little more on plastic and pushed the screen a little deeper into the body.
-the camera shows the settings on the LCD on the back. While I think this is ok, I do feel as though it shortens the battery life. You can change the settings to turn it off, but the shortest is goes is 30 seconds. I wish it had the old digital readout on the older and higher-end cameras. then you could see the settings all the time.
-I do have a dead pixel on my LCD, that bummed me out, but it's not bad.
-This is a wish more than a complaint, but I would like to be able to fold up the mirror and be able to see the LiveView that's available on the Olympus SLR's and the Mark III. I would think that it wouldn't be that hard to do.
-I have worries about APS-C sensors being discontinued, which could mean no future lenses. But since Canon seems to have made a solid consumer-based camera line, I don't think it'll be anytime soon. 
Overall, it's a great camera. I recommend you get this or a Nikon over the other brands. Between this and the Nikon, get this. As a consumer-grade, this really is top of the line.

Title: Good heater for the price
Content:
Well, yes, it is loud. But not much louder than other heaters. The problem with this heater is that the fan is set to one speed only, high speed.
If the sound doesn't bother you that much, then this is a great heater. It has loads of features and heats up nicely (in San Francisco, so no freezing temps here).
The display is in degrees F or C. The manual says you can change it by pressing the "+" for 5 secs, well, it's wrong. You have to press it for about 20 secs or until it beeps and changes from F to C or vice-versa. And it doesn't say to press the "+" button on the device, not the control.
They unit has a pretty good thermostat considering the price. It is not 100% accurate but works just fine for me. I love that you can just make 1 degree F adjustments.

Title: Very disappointed, broken after 1 use
Content:
The idea of a single cup maker, at an inexpensive price, was motivation for my young daughter to purchase this as a Christmas gift. It worked for one cup of coffee on Christmas morning and would never turn on again. After an extensive wait period at the 800 number supplied for any type of warranty I learned that it would cost $7.50 check, cut the plug off, purcase a mailing package and mail it to the Ohio address at unknown cost for the certified mailing. They would mail anoter unit back. No refund for the return expenses and of course no guarantee the new one would last any longer than one use. Thus a replacement unit plus the original purchase would be nearly a double cost and not worth the time. Purchasing one at a store could save the headaches if returning it to the store on another shopping trip.Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug

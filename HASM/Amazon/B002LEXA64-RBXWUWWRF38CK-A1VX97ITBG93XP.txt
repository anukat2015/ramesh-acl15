Title: A step up from a netbook
Content:
Wow! This is a great machine.
I had previously researched a number of netbooks but never pulled the trigger.  The small screen size / resolution (10inches / 600p) and slow processors kept me from making the purchase. I figured you would keep having to scroll down to see anything. Plus the slow processors would be limiting. When I saw this laptop and read the reviews I decided to purchase one. 
Acer includes a free upgrade to Windows 7.  From what I have read, performance improves with Windows 7.  It is able to play HD movies which is something regular netbooks cannot.  I would highly recommend it.
Pros:
-Battery life - easily 5 hours of heavy use before recharging.
-Screen - crisp and clear, colors stand out
-Processor - performance is good, it can play HD content.  Response is snappy.
-Features - wireless n networking is great, 
-Size - It's small size makes it very portable.  I have been using it to read my online newspaper.  Keybard is about full size.
Cons:
- does not have bluetooth but don't know what I would use it for.
- great if it had a two core processor
- wish it had the larger battery like the European model.

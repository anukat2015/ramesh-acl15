Title: Looks Good, Tastes Bleh!
Content:
Produces lukewarm coffee. Cannot make hot coffee, even using the 1-4 cup button. Uses a hotplate which only heats the outside of the thermal carafe. This is a useless feature; can't place it anywhere. I've owned a 12 cup carafe coffee maker by Cuisinart for the last couple of years. It made great coffee and made it hot. It tended to sometimes overflow if the basket was not properly inserted. Overflowing coffee ran down into the buttons on the base and disabled all the controls. This DCC-1150 model has the buttons above the carafe. I thought this would solve the overflow problem. It would be a great design if the temperature issues were addressed.

Title: Almost perfect 4 cup coffee maker
Content:
If you like the older model Mr Coffee 4 cup models ( which you can't find anylonger ) then you should really like this one.  It has the swing away filter holder with A BASKET THAT hold's a paper filter ( that just lifts out ). No mess making the coffee.  In fact i use my old Mr Coffee carafe ( that has the wide opening ) and removed the little rubber stop inside the basket holder since i don't use the pause & serve feature ) and for my personal use I now have the almost perfect coffee maker.  Build quality is very good with a SOLID  feeling.  The only complaint i have is that it comes in BLACK only.  I found the seller ( Green Tree ) service to be excellent.

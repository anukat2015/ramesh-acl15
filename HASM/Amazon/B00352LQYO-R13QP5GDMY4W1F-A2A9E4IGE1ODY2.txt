Title: it's great when it works.
Content:
got this laptop on the 30th, i noticed that it was missing the battery when i was unboxing it, but amazon is really helpful and sending me an replacement for me to take out the battery and ship the laptop back.
ok now onto the laptop it self, it's great when it's working, it's fast, really liking the wide screen. but the first time i closed the lid while the laptop was still on, it went to sleep as a normal laptop would but when i opened the lid and tried to log in when the screen came back up, i got my first blue screen and the system had to restart. so i changed the setting for closing the lid to do nothing and it hasn't happened again.
everything is was great the second night when i was using it, and it turned it off normally before i went to sleep, but when i came back from work just now 30 minutes before i started to write this review, the laptop wouldn't turn on, the fan just spins really fast and screen is blank, no backlights or anything, so i held the power button to turn it off then tried again then the same thing happened, tried that for 5 more time, still the same thing. so i pressed the quick start up button and windows started normally, it's so weird.
this is when i know i can't keep this laptop, so when the replacement comes i'm keeping the new one and sending this one back, it's too scary that all these things happened within 2 days of owning this, i have never had a problem like this with my old dell vostro 1500, i guess there's too many new tech in this that it's acting weird, but i really hope i just got a bad system and the replacement will have no problems.
i've read other reviews of people having similar problems, but not everyone had problems so i just hope the replacement is perfect.

Title: Horrid Repair Policy - Read  before considering a purchase
Content:
I love the features of the Zen:M.  I have owned 3, but this will be my last.  The first one I bought had to be returned twice for problems with the headphone connector.
Recently the 30 GB version I own lost it's FM ability. So when I call they inform me the only service they offer for those of us who are out of warranty is to replace the unit ($249!).
So my issue is that I have owned 4 Creative devices, all but one eventually failed (within 2 years).  I can only guess that Creative has also seen the failure rate and has decided to bailed on supporting a faulty product.

Title: Do I Smell Smoke?
Content:
I really enjoy my fireplace, but I don't enjoy the price of logs, carrying up wood to my condo, and/or the cleaning process.  My parents purchased this unit and was I surprised by how real and nice it looked in their home.  I decided to purchase one of my own and it's been a fantastic addition to my condo.  It turns on with a remote control, the cord is easy to hide, very easy to install, blows heat if you choose, and creates a nice look without the mess.  I've been very happy with mine.

Title: It does what it claims, but...
Content:
I purchased one of these in black for use in my shop and one in white as a gift for my mom.
The one that I am using daily has a small defect that may prove to be a quirk of the one I received or a broader defect that you may encounter.
The dispensing valve allows a small amount of water to leak out of the tank. The base of the unit then simply allows the water to run off and onto whatever it is sitting on. I solved this by simply laying a rag over the bottom. The water evaporates from the rag faster than the leak.
The only other issue is that the bottom is not open like it's predecessor. This does not allow for the filling of taller mugs or some soup bowl prepared foods.
All and all, it functions the way in need and is priced reasonable for what you get.

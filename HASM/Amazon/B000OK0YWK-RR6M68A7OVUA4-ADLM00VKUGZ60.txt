Title: Good player with software "problem"
Content:
Hello, I have Zune 30GB over a month and so far I am very happy about it. Solid case, good sound....nevertheless I was very surprised when I started organized my music files - simply there is probably some bad routine in software, because it does not organize my files in the order I want. I spoke to my friends and they reported similar problem. If anybody knows how to fix it.....

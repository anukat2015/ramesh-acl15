Title: HP CUSTOMER SERVICE SO BAD, THINK TWICE
Content:
I am in the throes of the worst customer service experience of my life. 11 hours on the phone, 2 weeks, appeal to case management & I am no closer to receiving warranty replacement for hard drive that failed after 3 months. Judging from web content, this is the typical story for HP customer service.

Title: Works great!
Content:
It's hard to find a space heater safe for the bath, but this one is. Works great too. Timer is super - I have it set to come on at 4am and it's warm by my showering time at 7am. Other reviews talk about how this does not work in large open areas and I was concerned because my bath area has an open door into the bedroom, but it heats the area just fine. Not going to get over-heated or hot, but no chill in the air which is what I wanted. My floors are all tile and it keeps the floors room temperature too. I would purchase this heater again.

Title: I liked this unit
Content:
I liked this unit and I used one for several years and then donated it to a young, newly-married couple who are still using it to the best of my knowledge. I felt it was sturdy and I liked having the controls on the handlegrip, the ease of popping the bottom unit off with a foot peddle and reattaching bottom unit with a push and click method. The retractable cord never once jammed.  A longer cord would have been helpful, but it wasn't a big problem.  I also like that the accessories were in a covered compartment on top of the unit because they wouldn't fall off like some upright units.  Bags were a little tricky to attach but once attached, they were fine.  Only once I attached it poorly and it blew dirt on the inside of the canister.  Mine didn't have a hepa filter which would have been nice, but overall it was a decent vacuum cleaner.

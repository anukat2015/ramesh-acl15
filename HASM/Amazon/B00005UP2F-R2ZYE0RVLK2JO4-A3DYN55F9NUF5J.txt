Title: Very nice bagless
Content:
My first bagless, I've owned many uprights, usually try to buy the newest and best, but I've gotten tired of tossing away bag after bag.  With 3 small children, vacuuming is a daily chore, and changing bags gets to be expensive.  This vacuum is great for daily jobs - gets under furniture, picks up spilled cheerios along with small bits of paper.  The only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that it does such a great job with dust - it must have cleaned my carpets cleaner than they have been in years, but then the filter is messy to clean.  I usually stick the whole filter inside a grocery store bag and clean it that way, but still a bit messy.  But, the money I've saved with this vacuum far surpasses that minor inconvience.  I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a good bagless vacuum.

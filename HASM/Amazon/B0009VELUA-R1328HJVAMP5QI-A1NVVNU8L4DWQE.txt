Title: Good Coffee, Good Looking Machine, Much Irritation
Content:
This coffee maker was purchased for our small office, and it is a great improvement over the last coffee maker we had. I would swear that the coffee tastes better!
The coffee maker is sleek and stylish. It fits well into the small space that we have available. It meets our needs.
However, the design of the coffee reservoir drives me up the wall. There are multiple nooks and crannies, as well as a lip around the edge that makes it difficult to empty old coffee into the sink quickly without making a mess. There is a snazzy pour spout, but again it is agonizingly slow and potentially messy (if you're rushing things).
You are supposed to be able to fill the coffee reservoir with water to pour into a water reservoir. I have not yet been able to do so without spilling at least a little bit of water. 
It makes me long for the old days and our crappy coffee maker - which had the same design concept - coffee without the carafe. 
This is a good coffee maker and has made good coffee. It loses major points for the many design flaws of the coffee reservoir.

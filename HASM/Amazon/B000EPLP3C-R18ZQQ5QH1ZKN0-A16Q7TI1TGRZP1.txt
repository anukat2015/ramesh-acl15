Title: Zune
Content:
I purchased this when they first went on sale. It was a gift for my wife to use for her music lesson business. What a waste! For the first several days, my wife spent several hours with customer support. The support people were helpful, but most of the fixes have not worked long term. My wife and I are somewhat tech savvy, but this equipment did not and has not performed as expected.It has not worked correctly most of the past couple of years. As a result, my wife rarely is able to use it in her lessons. It has recorded music pieces over each other, but does not replace the previously recorded material. So it mixes the two pieces together. If you search for a piece, generally you will not find the piece unless you remember adjacent music from the original recording that you downloaded. Perhaps some of the problem is with the service the Zune uses to download the music, but this was one expensive TOY.  We have not gone over to the Apple side simply because I remember too many times that the Apple equipment is not backward compatible and seemed designed solely to make you buy the next "upgrade" that in reality is a new system that will not use any of the previous products.

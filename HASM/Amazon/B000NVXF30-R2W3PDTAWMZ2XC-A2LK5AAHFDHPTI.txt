Title: Fantastic Camera, you can't go wrong with it.
Content:
Dollar for dollar this camera is amazing. All the features you get, for less money than either Canon or Nikon charge for their over esteemed brand names. Neither of the bigger name brands offer you live-view (which admittedly I use much less than I thought I would), the ability to zoom in on a detail and confirm focus though makes this feature worth having alone. A photography journalist friend of mine recommended this camera, and I am glad he did. Pictures are great, though yes, I have also owned a Nikon D40x and was also very pleased with the pictures from it, and in fact perhaps the Nikon has more "foolproof" picture taking ability, the absence of stability control in the body of the Nikon alone is reason to reject it. I've already upgraded both the kit lenses, so my one recommendation if your budget can afford it is but the body ONLY and then purchase the high-quality lenses separately. If you are pushing to just get into the SLR realm then, by all means those "kit" lenses are far better quality than you will get in either Nikon's packages or Canon's. Plus the kit lenses from Olympus are incredibly and light and compact, fantastic for travel.

Title: The Best
Content:
Many years ago, I owned a Faberware Perculator and was always pleased with it but when it finally broke I started using automatic drip makers.
They were okay but not the best. Here we are years later and I made the decision to go back to Faberware. I see what I have been missing. The best cup of coffee you can get anywhere.

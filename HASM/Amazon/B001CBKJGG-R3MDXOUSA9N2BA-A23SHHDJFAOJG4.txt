Title: Great SLR for Amateur Photogs!
Content:
This camera is definitely a must-have for anyone who cares about the visual quality of their pictures.  It can be adjusted to be as creative or simple as you want it to be, and it's easy to learn how to use on the creative side.  I spent a good 2 hours going through the functions and settings, and then just starting playing with it.  I used it a lot over the holidays, and I'm learning how to compose my pictures and take better looking shots with just a couple of quick adjustments on the fly.  The price and accessories included with this in the kit make it a must have purchase, which will be a good long-term investment.  I highly recommend buying a good telephoto lens as well, because the kit lens is only good to about 30 yards.  All in all, this is a great value and investment.

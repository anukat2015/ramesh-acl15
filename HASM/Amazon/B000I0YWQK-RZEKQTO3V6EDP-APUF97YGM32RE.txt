Title: unhappy Inconvience
Content:
I ORDERED, PAID AND WAITED FOR WEEKS I HAVE NEVER RECIEVED THE PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN FROM AMAZON. NO ONE EVER EVEN CONTACTED ME FROM AMAZON THEY JUST TOOK MY MONEY AND RUN.NOT COUNTING THE FACT THAT I WAITED NOT WANTING TO BUY ANOTHER HEATER THINKING THIS ONE SHOULD ARRIVE ANY DAY??? THIS THING HAS COST ME MUCH MORE THAN THE PRICE I GOT RIPED OFF FOR.

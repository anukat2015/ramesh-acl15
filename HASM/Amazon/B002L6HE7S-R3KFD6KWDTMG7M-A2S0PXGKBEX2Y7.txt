Title: Crazy ipod
Content:
Recently bought a 5th generation for a gift. The person loved the ipod, specially the new camera feature on the 5th generation. He would not stop making videos and recording. However, the product was defective!!! the volume would go up and down by itself several times while playing music. Took it to a McStore for diagnosis. They rebooted the ipod but the problem continued. Finally we took it to another McStore and they just exchanged it for a new one, eventhough I didn't buy it there. That's a nice warranty!

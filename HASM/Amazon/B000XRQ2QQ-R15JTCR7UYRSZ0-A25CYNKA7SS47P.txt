Title: Revolution in PMP!
Content:
this is the first player I've ever used that doesn't really need a PC !
just enable wifi, hook into them Rhapsody channels and click away when you hear anything you like or just listen for hours browsing through the artists' bios and simular music that it keeps suggesting you.
really great experience, highly recommended!
now got to install an A2DP Bluetooth adapter (or car stereo) in the car to make it magically play without any wires there :-)

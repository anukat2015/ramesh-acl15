Title: Love the brewstation!
Content:
This is the 3rd brewstation we have purchased and we love the fact that we can just get one cup at a time.  The coffee brews nicely and doesn't ever taste burnt or bitter even after being on for 4 hours.  The spout does need to be further out from the back as it does sometimes spill down the back...this is why I give it a 4 star and not a 5.  I am willing to put up with this becuase I love the rest of it!

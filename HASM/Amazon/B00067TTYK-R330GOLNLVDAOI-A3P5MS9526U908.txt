Title: Seriously in need of help!!
Content:
I really loved this mp3 player, it had great sound, useful features, and it held all the songs I wanted, but then, it started screwing up.  I was listening to it and it just froze.  It wouldn't turn off or respond to anything, so I took the battery out and put it back in.  When it turned on, it was on recovery mode, and I don't know how to get out of it!  I've tried letting the battery die and recharging it, rebooting, cleaning up, attaching it to the computer, reloading firmware, and pushing just about every button on there, but it still won't go away!  I can't listen to anything until I can find a way out of the recovery screen.  The exact same thing happened to my sister at about the same time.  If you know how to fix this, send me an email at qwerpi@kiwibox.com.  For anyone thinking of getting a zen micro,just pay for the ipod, it's worth it.

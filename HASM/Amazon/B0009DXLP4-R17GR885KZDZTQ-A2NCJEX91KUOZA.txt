Title: very quiet German product
Content:
We ordered this vacuum after seeing one a friend had that impressed us with how very QUIET it was when operating. It is pricey, but is like a BMW of vacuums with high quality German engineering. You can almost have a conversation while vacuuming, it is that quiet. Previous other brands have been soooo noisy that one risked hearing impairment if ear protection wasn't worn, this machine is a huge relief.

Title: Overall, pretty awesome
Content:
I am a college student, obviously purchased this for college, and it is awesome, im acutally writing this review on this computer right now, haha...anyways, other then the graphics card, this was an awsome purchase...sony and microsoft are great for support accessibility... the computer delievers awesome speed, and now with windows 7 its even faster..the processor is above average for most laptops, and the 4gb of RAM is also a great perk.   The computer is good looking, lightweight(all around good for mobility) quick and easy to set up or pack up.. fast startup nice layout of buttons and keyboard..responsive...and ABOVE ALL DEPENDABLE!  
Thanks alot!

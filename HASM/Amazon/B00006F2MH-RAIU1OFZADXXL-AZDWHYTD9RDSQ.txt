Title: A real mess
Content:
We owned and loved the "old" version of this coffee maker. Although it was a slight pain to clean, it only took about 5 minutes, and we really got good use out of it (about 4 years). When it finally broke (something started to short out in the base), Cuisinart said they wouldn't fix it or replace it.
So, we bought this new one after reading the reviews. We were especially excited to hear that it was easier to clean.
Unfortunately, this machine is a dud. Although it probably is easier to clean the parts, it is only incrementally easier. What is worse, though, is that coffee sludge slowly leaks out of the grinder and down the inside of the machine, gumming up the sliding tray that holds the grounds. What results is that the grounds holder won't slide in and out without forcing it, and the back of the coffee maker (the part behind the carafe), is covered wity gooey coffee sludge. Gross.
So, about every 2-3 weeks, I have to dismantlte ths sliding mechanism and take a brush and clean out all the nooks and crannies of coffee gunk. 
Anyway, the coffee seems fine, and the rest of the machine works OK. But I definitely would not buy this model again. We picked up another one of the original models, and it is sitting in the box waiting for this one to die.
There are a few other models on the market - Beyonds Mill and Brew looks interesting, but for now, we're stuck with this one.
UPDATE: This machine "blew up", spewing coffee and grounds all over the counter and floor. We had enough and bought a replacement  - an original version of this coffemaker. This "old" model is much better than the new one - just as easy to clean and it doesn't leak.

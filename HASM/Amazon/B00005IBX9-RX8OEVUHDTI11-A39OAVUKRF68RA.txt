Title: good coffee maker, don't expect miracles
Content:
for an electric drip, it's very good.  recently rated extremely highly by Consumer Reports.  cone-type filter.  Achilles heel of most electric drips is insufficiently heated water; water should be close to 200 F for proper extraction; this one comes close.  attractive, nicely featured.  obviously, it's a glass carafe that continues to heat (3 settings); after, say, an hour, coffee will start to taste overcooked, but i only have a few cups first thing in the a.m., so not a big.  thermal carafes are a seductive idea, but most (all?) are mediocre; the coffee cools, and if you add cold milk/cream, it's a lukewarm cup.  and if the water wasn't heated sufficiently to begin with, you're really screwed.  so this is a good compromise; starts very hot, stays hot.  best home coffee makers remain french press and stove-top "espresso" makers, but they're not nearly as convenient. but if you have the time, or you had a sleepover playdate, that's the way to go.  for school/workdays, get this one.

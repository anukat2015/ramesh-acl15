Title: great little vac
Content:
I recently bought this vacuum and was surprised.  My mom owns an electrolux and found that the DD vacuum works better. I have hard wood throught my house and some area rugs and it works awesome.  The one thing I do not like and my husband also agrees- the tools are on the wand and that is a terrible place for them- do they even use the product after designing it!!!  They always fall off and are a pain- i just put them in the closet and when I need them i go and get them.  I love how lightweight the vacuum is and how the wand extends great for stairs and cleaning the car.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the tools always falling off the wand.  Great vac very satisfied!

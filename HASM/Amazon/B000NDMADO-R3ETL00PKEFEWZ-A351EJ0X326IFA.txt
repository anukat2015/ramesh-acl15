Title: None above
Content:
After spending a few months looking around for a new vacuum, the decision fell on the Dyson DC21. It is amazing!
I spend some time looking at the other products listed on [...] and although they like the Hoover and others, I could not justify buying anything else than the Dyson based on total cost of ownership. Compared to others and reading the reviews this was simply the one that had the least problems over time.
Pros:
hardwood and carpet is just second to none
the nice easy wrap up makes it easy to store
Long Warrenty and according to other reviews no issues to mention
Easy to empty
Cons:
The single problem i have is the final hook for the hose when wrapped up. it slips out easily and you have to put it back in. Hard to explain but rolled up around the vacuum it does not hold tight at the very last hook.
One very happy customer and found a great price here at Amazon.

Title: Great product, worth the price
Content:
I bought the DC23 over two months ago and have been using it several times a week.  I live in a condo with solid-surface flooring and have four animals, two cats and two dogs.  The DC23 was purchased to replace or augment a Dyson DC14 Animal Upright that I've used for the last 7+ years.  
While I initially agreed with some of the other reviewers comments about the seemingly lightweight or "plastic" construction of the DC23, it now seems that the vacuum was engineered so that the low-stress parts are more lightweight while more durability was designed into the parts that would normally see more abuse.  I think that the goal was to keep the unit as small and lightweight as possible, which echoes the engineering I've seen in my DC14 upright.  I do wish the power cord was a bit longer, but the self-winding cord storage is a real perk.  I also wish that it had a longer hose, but the unit is so small and lightweight that moving it around behind you isn't all that difficult or even noticeable.  
The sheer vacuumming strength of this unit is amazing... it's actually outperformed my upright and my every expectation.  It's easy to use, very manuverable and very efficient.  Bear in mind that I purchased it for use on hardwood floors only... I've not used it with carpeting nor do I plan to do so. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone with needs similar to my own.

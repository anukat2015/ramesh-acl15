Title: Very Very happy with this computer
Content:
I have only had this for five or so days but i am in love with it already lol. 
I am a amateur photogrpher and i already have a bunch of photos stored on it, the space on this is great! 
I have been on about eight or nine different sites (including youtube) at once and they are all as fast as just haveing one open. 
The web cam is good quality, with great effects. the mic is crystal clear. 
The lightscribe is great, even though it isnt in color i definitely prefer it over labels.  
Oh, the only thing i wasnt looking forward to was the fact that the battery only last two hours. But it actually last about 4 hours, and that is with the laptop open and being used for four hours straight.

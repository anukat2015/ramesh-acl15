Title: broke down in short order!
Content:
I was so excited to get this product!  Thankfully,  I didnt spend full price on this mp3 player.  I didnt get to use it right away when I got it because I didnt have time to set it all up.  I used this product for aproximately 2 months before it would not work anymore.  The mp3 player got stuck on building library and would not do anything else after that.  I turned it off and then I took the battery out.  I hooked it up to my computer to see if I could just wipe it clean and start over, but nothing would happen.  I am so disappointed in this product and I am very happy that I only spent $100 on it.  I had a phillips mp3 player before I had ordered this one and I love it and will be using that one from now on.  I was going to give the phillips one to my husband because it doesnt have as much storage.  I guess that I will have to keep searching for a different mp3 player that has more storage and actually works right.  I also didnt care for the whole set up of the menu on this mp3 player, alot more difficult to figure out than the phillip player!  The really bad part is that it has been past the warranty so I cant do anything about it.  If you are going to buy this product I would recommend an extended warranty with it!

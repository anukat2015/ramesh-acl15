Title: Why the stupid Beeps & Lights?
Content:
I bought this product yesterday at a local retailer and will be returning it tomorrow.  It heats well and quickly.  But the list of issues and stupid design decisions with this heater is long.  
 - Every time you push a button the heater beeps VERY loud.  
 - When you turn the temperature set dial, it beeps for every degree change (Very loud)
 - The fan noise is high and not consistent.  I'm not sure if the rapid fan speed changes are "normal" or if my unit is broken.
 - There is a blue light strip that is for looks only.  Which if you use this to heat a room when you go to sleep, it adds light to the room for no reason.
Without the beeps I would consider keeping the unit.  But the beeps are just crazy loud and there's no reason for them.

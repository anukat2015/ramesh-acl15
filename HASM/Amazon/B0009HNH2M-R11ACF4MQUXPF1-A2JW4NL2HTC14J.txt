Title: Dissapointing
Content:
I bought this since it had good reviews. The part of the hose that attaches to the body of the canister is quite flimsy and can rip apart easily. Also, the base (the rectangular part that sweeps the floors) is quite heavy. So it does become a chore to move it back and forth.

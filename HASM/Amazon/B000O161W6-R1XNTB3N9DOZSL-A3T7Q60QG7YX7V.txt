Title: First DSLR purchase
Content:
I've owned digital cameras since 2000, all of which have been point and shoot. DSLR's have been out of my price range until as of recently. I did tons of research on on DSLR cameras and boiled it down to the Nikon D40X. I did consider the D40 which is a 6MP (the D40X is a 10MP) but opted to spend the extra cash and get the beefier of the two. The only differences between the two is other than the mega pixels is that the flash sync is 1/500 on the D40 and 1/200 on the D40X, the D40 has a frame rate of 2.5fps and the D40X has a frame rate of 3fps and the lowest ISO on the D40 is 200 and 100 on the D40X. The picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend getting the Nikon SB-600 flash with this camera. Using this flash and bouncing it off the ceiling greatly reduces or eliminates the harsh shadow that the pop-up flash which is included with the camera creates. 
I bought the D40X with the 18-55mm lens. I also bought the Nikkor 55-200 lens that is compatible with this camera. In my opinion, I think the optimum lenses to have would be the 18-135mm and the 70-300mm. Of course this will greatly increase the cost, but the 18-55 doesn't have much range and it would have been nice to get that extra distance that the 18-135 would give. The same holds true with the 55-200. I would like that extra distance the 70-300 would have given me. I guess I can always do some cropping in PhotoShop to get that extra "zoom" that the 10mp gives me. 
All in all, I love this camera it's very comfortable and feels sturdy. I'm sure the more I learn about it and how to use a DSLR camera the more I'll like it.

Title: May need to clean the sensor often
Content:
I have Canon 20D for just two months and took about 1000 pictures. After first two weeks, I found there were some spots on the sensor. Amazon changed a new one for me (very good service). After using for two weeks, there were some spots on the pcitures again. I probably changed lenses for about 7-8 times for the cameras. For some reasons, it seems to me that D20's sensor "attracts" dust easily compared with Digital Rebel (300D). I used 300D for 18 months, but I never have any problem like this. 
Please note that, there is a small section in the 20D manual (p36-37) descriing sensor clearing by selecting .... on manual dial....  but there is no sensor cleaning on 20D. Maybe the manual is just translated from Japanese manual and the function is not available for US version.... I am not sure. 
The sensor clearing fee is about $80 for Canon authorized prepair shop. D20 generates better pcitures than 300D. but for the sensor cleaning issue, I give it ***. I am really afraid changing lenses now since the sensor gets dust so easily. BTW, the blower does not really work for sensor.

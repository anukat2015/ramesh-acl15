Title: It was great while it worked
Content:
The coffee was delicious and I raved about it. Right until it stopped working 2 weeks after I started using it. It just wouldn't draw up and heat the water. It ground the beans, the timer worked fine, I could hear the heating elements coming on, just wouldn't heat the water. There is no way to open it and see what's wrong inside. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING on a Sunday morning. Better run out and grab the old coffeemaker out of the trash. And of course I threw the huge box out, since it did work at first.

Title: Like it so far, afte a month
Content:
Looked all over for sub-$900 unit with 1Gig and 100Meg+, and 64-bit processor.  Never considered a Gateway, til I saw the beautiful screen, noticeably better than the HPs, etc.  I'd say as good as a Sony screen.  I actually like the keyboard, just a preference thing, though others appear not to like it very much.  One note is to see the units with dual-core processors...they've dropped a few hundred in the past month since I bought this.  Again, though, this unit is real nice for the price.

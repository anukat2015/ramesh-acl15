Title: iPod Nano
Content:
This is a great product, probably the best mP3 for $150.  The backlit screen is much brighter, the battery life is longer and it is extremely light.  The sound quality is very good and unless you have jumbo-sized hands, it is the perfect size.
It does have games that you can play while you listen, it has and adress book and a calender that can bee synced with iTunes.
The only flaw that I have found so far is you have to charge the battery on the computer by plugging it in there.  So, when you plug it in, it tries to sync with iTunes as well and is a pain in the neck.
I would suggest this product for everyone because it does a little something for people of all ages.

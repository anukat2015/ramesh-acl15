Title: I'm a fan!
Content:
I should have converted from PC to Mac a long time ago.  Leopard is so much better than Windows.  The apps are easy to use and looks great.  The laptop itself is a beauty with an excellent screen and illuminated keyboard.  Love multi-touch so much that I don't like to use the regular touchpad on my wife's laptop.  I'll be back on Amazon shopping for an iMac when I need to replace my desktop PC!

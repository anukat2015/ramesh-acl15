Title: Satisfied with this
Content:
I've had this for about 2 months now.  I placed this in front of our fireplace in our lower level family room that has a draft.  For the first week, it really smelled of burning oil (as stated in the instructions).  It almost came to the point that I was going to return it because of that smell.  I'm glad we stuck with it though.  Eventually the smell went away.
This is not the heater for you if you want to immediately warm the area after turning it on.  It increases the surrounding temperature but takes a little time.  In my case, I leave it on an hour or two before coming down to our 15x25 foot family room with my 13 month old.  I still use an extra oscillating space heater on the other side by my son's play area to make sure he's comfortable.  Even without the extra heater it makes a sizeable difference in the temperature downstairs.
Would I buy it again?  Definitely.

Title: Ipod 160 Gig Review
Content:
No complaints once you get this device dialed in to your liking.  After graduating from a 40 Gig Photo Classic to the 160, my only gripes after owning this device 1 month is the retarded "Volume Locking" portion and the Outlook Email syncing contacts (poorly written as syncing protocol - too long to explain why).  Re;  Volume Locking:  suggestion is to put that Volume Lock on Maximum and control the volume from the wheel as normal.  It is terribly annoying and frustrating to have to constantly enter a pass key to manipulate that locking feature when you are dissatisfied with your choice.  No amplifier, car radio or any other music related device has a volume locking feature.  We are now faced with two volume sections on a single device.
On the upside, as far as some of the other complaints I have seen and read here, I have not experienced any of them such as the slowness in scrolling or the Ditigal/Analog converter.  In Itunes, just be sure and rip at a higher sampling rate such as 256k/Stereo or 320kbps vs. the low res 128kpbs which may help.  A big plus is the large alphabetical letters when scrolling through your library, a clock that lights up the front screen while playing music and several other goodies such as a larger screen.  After paying $425 for the 40 gig Photo, the $344 was a welcoming price for a drive that is 4x larger.
Overall, I am quite satisfied with this choice especially after almost running out of space on the previous 40 gig...whew...just in time.

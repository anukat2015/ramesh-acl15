Title: Great product!
Content:
I researched a lot of products of this type before deciding to purchase this product.  It doesn't require expensive pods or filters, you can grind your favorite beans and pour them right in or use your regular morning blend straight from the grocery store. The travel mug is the perfect size and the stainless steel keeps your coffee at a great temperature even until the last drop.  For the price, this a great value.  I have used mine every day since it arrived.  It took a couple of tries to get the perfect amount of coffee for the size of the cup, but once I figured it out, it has been great.  One reviewer mentioned the sturdiness of the mug.  The handle must have been what he or she was talking about.  I wouldn't want to be rough with the handle, but with normal everyday wear, I think it will still hold up to the usage.  Great product - perfect price!

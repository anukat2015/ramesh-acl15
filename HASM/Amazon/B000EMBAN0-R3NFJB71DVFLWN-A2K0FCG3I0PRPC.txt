Title: HATE WASTING MY TIME!
Content:
I bought this because I was trying to stay away from 'work one year eurekas.'  In that aspect it was a success.  It lasted for two.  It is heavy, too heavy to do stairs with, and looks substantial but a Dyson it is NOT!  It couldnt live up to the challenge of pet hair and was cumbersome to maneuver.  It finally died after two years, and my DH is one that takes them apart and rescusitates them for a bit longer.  Not bad since eurekas tend to die after a year.  
We finally did get that dyson and boy did we see the difference.  Amazing for heavy duty spring cleaning.  For the downstairs every day use, I HIGHLY recommend a Bissell Helix I think is the name.  Amazing suction on pet hair.  If I have to replace that every year, I'll do so gladly because it cleans really well

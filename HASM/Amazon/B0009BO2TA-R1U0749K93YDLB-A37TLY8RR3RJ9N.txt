Title: Cute but faulty manufacturing
Content:
This vacuum is very cute to look at. I love the orange and the fact that it's lightweight but that's where the love affair ends. The wand is always falling off and I have resorted to keeping it off and using it like an oversized dustbuster. I suppose you can duct tape it together but what's the point of that?  It is terrible on carpeting, even very flat low shag carpets. The bags are hard to find and expensive. I usually just reuse the ones I have, cutting other close looking bags to size. You have to constantly clean the filter because it clogs up so fast and then all suction is lost.  
It's cheap though and ok for small areas but backbreaking for larger spaces.   Don't recommend it unless you live in a one bedroom apartment without carpeting, don't want to spend a lot, vacuum only a few times a month , and don't mind appliances that fall apart while you're using them.

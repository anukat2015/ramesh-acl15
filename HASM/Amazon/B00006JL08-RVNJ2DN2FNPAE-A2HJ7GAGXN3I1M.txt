Title: Great tast poorly designed
Content:
I really love Braun and was excited to get this.  I wasnt disappointed to get the same great flavor that I had with my old unit.  Yet the design of the carafe sucks.  It leaks virtually every time I pour no matter what.  I have resort to pouring it into a thermal carafe, which I prefer anyway.  I just pour it over the sink and who cares if it leaks.  I have come to live with it.  But it is ridiculous that such a thing was made.  Dont tell me that it tested in the factory without spilling.  The previous model didnt spill.  Just like an idiot to change a good thing.

Title: Best and Safest heater for your money!!
Content:
I just wanted to tell you..This is the best heater I have ever used..I have two heaters set at power level 2 and they keep my 14x80 single wide home at 74 degrees at night with a outside temp of 30 degrees...If I run them on High power 3, they roast us out of the place.. I have ceiling fans in every room running in reverse to draw up the hot air and circulate it, and my place is well insulated.. With propane as high as it is I have tuned my central forced air furnace off, and am using only these for my main heat source. Michgan is in winter weather now and I have not used my furnace once and my home has not gotten below 72 degrees..I am going to buy one more and that should keep us toasty when the temps are below zero..The smell only lasted for the first 3 or 4 hrs...I did as the instructions stated and ran it on high for the first 3 hrs. After that a faint odor which was totally gone by the 2nd day...You can feel the heat rush/blow out of the top of this heater, while the sides are not hot enough to get burnt on...Safe for pets and children..this is one powerfull AWESOME heater...Shawne1_

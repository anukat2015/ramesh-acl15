Title: A wonderful coffee maker - some tips on using
Content:
I am really happy with the way that this coffee pot keeps my coffee warm.  After using it I wanted to pass along some tips to making it a good experience.
1) I purchased the  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 4.  These are a bit too tall for the container, so I just cut 1/2" off the top (wide end), in bulk, when I open the box.  It takes about 30 seconds for the whole box.
2) I could not find a gold-plated coffee filter that really fit right, but that is okay, because using the resized paper filter (see above) is a much easier cleanup than emptying a permanent filter after using the coffee maker.
3) To keep the coffee as warm as possible I try to rinse out the pot with warm water right before making the coffee.
4) I slightly dampen the paper filters, and make sure to  press them to the sides of the filter holder - before putting in the grounds.  This is done to prevent a spill, because if the head that drips down the hot water doesn't clear the top of the filter when it is all closed, you will then have a giant mess on your kitchen counter top.  The filter can fold over, and then the coffee doesn't drain into the pot correctly.
While the above seem to be a bit of a chore, the results, when done correctly, are really nice.  I like not having a hot plate keeping a glass coffee pot warm, and being able to move the serving container to the table.

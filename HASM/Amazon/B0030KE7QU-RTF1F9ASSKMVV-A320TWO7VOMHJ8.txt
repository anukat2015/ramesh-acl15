Title: So far... AMAZING
Content:
I bought this laptop for video and web development after a friend bought the same. Windows 7 was already installed, so I was leery and excited. I have not been let down yet. I've never owned a Vista machine because I didn't want to deal with the in-between headaches of Microsoft's OS releases, so I waited until 7 was out in the market for a bit, having beta tested it as an MS Partner.
I've not been disappointed yet. All the things my clients and friends have complained about with Vista have not plagued my experience at all. It operates well with all the available memory and the applications share data exchange really well. I have more apps open at once than I should and this machine handles it all very gracefully
CONS: The only complaint is the cheesiness of the speakers, esp. for a Sony product and the very strange video-making program which is for total amateurs that need a wizard to make a video (not that that's a bad thing).

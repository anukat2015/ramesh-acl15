Title: Don't Waste Your Money
Content:
I agree with the other ladies who have written reviews:  Cute litte vacuum, no suction and the dang wand won't stay together - extremely annoying!  Is there no quality control anymore?  Didn't Hoover notice this really, really bad flaw???  Don't waste your money just because it's cute and not a bad price!  They couldn't even give it to me now.

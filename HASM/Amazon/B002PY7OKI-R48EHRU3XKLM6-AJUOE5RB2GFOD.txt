Title: Great laptop
Content:
Time of ownership:  2 days
Pros: Laptop is fast, light for it's size, doesn't come preloaded with a ton of junk (some, but it's easy enough to remove), screen is easy to look at (bright and crisp), keyboard is easy to type on, and computer looks great! 
Cons: Attracts fingerprints.  Intel graphics chip is kind of slow, if you want to game this might not be the best laptop for that.
Overall I would say it's a great laptop for the price

Title: An entry level professional camera
Content:
Greetings,
   Welcome to Professional Digital Photography at a reasonable entry level price. The Olympus E-500 combined with the FL-50 flash has all the features that anyone, pro or amateur, would want per a high quality digital SLR.  The only feature missing is a Titanium housing, but at this price, you could buy six E-500s before getting into the Titanium market per Digital SLRs.
   Olympus has done their homework and provided fast setups for most picture situations one would come across.  So point and shoot, and the camera will do the rest. It is really hard to take a bad picture with this setup!  But they didn't stop there.  Olympus also allows you to modify the quick setups manually per your creative desires per the moment.  So use the quick setups to get on target, then modify it per your special needs.
   The camera comes with the lower end Zuikor 14-45mm and 40-150mm lenses.  Not as good as the high-end Zuikor ED lenses, but much better than any point-n-shoot camera. I keep an Olympus SP-350 in the car,  which comes in handy when you rub fenders with another car!  It is also an 8 MegaPixel camera,  but take the same pic with the SP-350 and the E-500, and the quality is definitely noticeable.
   The good news. The E-500 is a quality professional camera at a great price.
   The bad news. The accessories cost more than the camera! You can spend $6,000 if you want to goto a 300mm Zuikor ED lens (600mm equivalent per a 35mm film camera).  Even the basics are overpriced per Flash Brackets and Sync Cords.
   But if you are looking to find a camera to match your creative talent, it is well worth considering the Olympus E-500.
   Who am I? I was a wedding photographer for years using Nikons, Hasselblads, and Mamiyas. I also worked with Rocky Gunn in California, considered at the time to be one of the top ten wedding photographers in the USA. Time and decades have passed, and I've moved on to other more profitable endeavors. Still my heart was in still photography.  And for all my years of experience,  I'm hard pressed  to find a major flaw with the E-500.  So check it out and decide for yourself.
Best Regards,
George

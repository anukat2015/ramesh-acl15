Title: Very Good Laptop
Content:
I recently purchased my Sony Vaio VGN-NW240 laptop and I'm happy to say I am very pleased with my purchase. The laptop is very fast, and easy to use. Right out of the bag, its already preloaded with windows 7, and Norton anti-virus 60 day trail. I decided not to use Norton because I have my own anti-virus software. The wireless option is great with this laptop, i find myself sitting on my couch all the time, no wires no worries. Excellent buy for the price, anyone looking at this laptop should know you'll be very pleased if you decided to purchase it. I know I am. I have no flaws, or complaints with this laptop. It does everything I ask it to do, and then some. Super fast, almost no load up time, just an all around great computer!!!

Title: Great vacuum
Content:
This is the best vacuum I have ever owned, and I have been through quite a few, although this is my first canister vacuum.  The amount of dust and dirt it sucks out of carpets is unbelievable. I have 2 dogs and cats that are occasionally inside, so I expected the pet hair, but I had no idea how much dirt was trapped in my carpets!  They actually look cleaner after using this vacuum the first time.  The controls are very easy to use and it is quick to set it up.  The suction is so powerful that you have to be careful that it doesn't unravel strands of carpet fibers along edges where they meet at the wall.  The powered hand tool is nice, but takes some getting used to (vs. my old vacuum) because you are holding the main had control instead of the attachment itself.  When the roller brush on the carpet attachment is turned off to use on hardwood or tile floors, the vacuum is extremely quiet.  The collection cup is kind of odd in that it is large but the fill area is a small section at the bottom.  The filter is in the collection cup and takes up most of the space.  It does fill quickly when you first use it, but there is a flap inside that minimizes the amount of dust that flies out.  It is very easy to clean the cup and the filter.  The self-propelled feature is very powerful, on the highest suction setting the carpet attachment will move itself forward if you don't hang onto it.  The wand is much easier to use than pushing around a canister vacuum.  I would higly recommend this vacuum to anyone.

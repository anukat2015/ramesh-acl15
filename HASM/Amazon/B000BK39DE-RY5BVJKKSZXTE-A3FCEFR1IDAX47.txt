Title: Best $$$/performance ratio
Content:
Think no further if you have been looking for a low price dslr, this is the camera for you. You will never get the same quality pictures out of the competition at the same price levels. Its competitors bundle low quality kit lenses that will never match the ones on Olympus kits. The 14-45 is as sharp (some even say sharper) as the pro 14-54 2.8-3.5, and the 40-150 is the best amateur tele lens in any system. With this two lens kit it will be long before you think about upgrading. On other systems, you will have to spend twice as much in order to get the same optical performance.
Low price doesn't mean lack of features. 8 megapixels, beginner modes, plus all the advanced options pro dsrls have. It is well built and has sensor cleaning technology. Never worry about dust!! 
Pictures come out great with no post processing, usual in Olympus. Get it, you will not regret it. No camera gives more bang for your $$$.

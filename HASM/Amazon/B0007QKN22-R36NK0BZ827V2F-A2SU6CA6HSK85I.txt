Title: The focal length multiplier is the only down side
Content:
Amazing pictures. Rich colors, practically no noise, sharp and full of detail. The A-DEP mode is my favorite feature for those arty shots. The instant response makes for much better photos than a compact digital camera.
For me, the killer feature of the Canon over other DSLRs and high end all-in-one cameras is the usable ISO 1600. Yes, there's noise, but only about as much as my old PowerShot S100 produced all the time. Put a cheap 50mm f/1.8 lens on, and you can take handheld photos indoors without flash. In old churches, even.
The only downside with the camera is that your 50mm lens becomes an 80mm, and it's very expensive to get anything equivalent to a wide angle lens on a film SLR because you need it to be a 20mm or less. If you like wide angle shots, you might want to hold off for a full frame sensor.

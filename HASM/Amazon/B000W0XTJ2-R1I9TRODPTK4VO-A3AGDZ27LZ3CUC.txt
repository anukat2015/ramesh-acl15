Title: The screen is 100% Scratch Proof but not the CASE
Content:
I am regretting buying this product.
My laptop has a lot of scratch on the screen frame and the case for my 2nd month of using. 
HP Designer should use there common sense that laptop are mobilized device that people use to bring anywhere and they should focus on the durability of this device.
Never buy any shiny products from HP if you hate scratches.
I am wondering if there is a way I could refund or exchange my product after buying my laptop last November 2007.

Title: Really handy tool.
Content:
I bought this little heater last November. Here in south Louisiana, we get all of about 5 weeks of winter a year. Well, during our winter, some of the our guys on our trim crew (interior residential trim) HATE the cold , so I got this to put in the house to warm up with. ALL OF US LOVE IT , we ended up putting it in any small bedroom and, while it takes a few minutes for it to warm up a bedroom, it does fine , and we could get around 5 days of use before having to fill up the tank again. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because the piezo ignition went out after about a week, not a really big deal, but it should have lasted longer I believe.

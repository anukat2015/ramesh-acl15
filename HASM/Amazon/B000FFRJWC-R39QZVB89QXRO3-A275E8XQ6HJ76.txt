Title: not shabby...
Content:
Look, this is no Dyson.  Clearly, you're not paying for that level of quality.  However, at the price I paid, I think this vacuum is super.  I have two cats and a serious shedding carpet too, which I have struggled through with multiple vacuums.  I have time and again experienced clogged suction pathways, which I manually had to unscrew the vacuum and clean out the tunnels.  However, the structure of this vacuum is simple enough that it doesn't get clogged and goes directly into the canister.  I am impressed for what I paid.  If you're a poor med student like myself, buy it.  If you're a doctor, like I will be in two years, buy the Dyson.

Title: Big disappointment
Content:
When our old Krups died, I wanted a quick replacement.  Since we loved the coffee from that machine, I went ahead and purchased this machine without first checking out the reviews. Big mistake! The lid on the pot does not detach or open all the way, making it very difficult to fill or wash.  I was able to put the pot from our old machine in the dishwasher, but with this design, there's no way.  I'm sure I'm going to break the lid off one day, out of frustration. Pouring from a full pot is challenging; coffee dribbles everywhere.  The measurements on the pot do not match the measurements on the machine, and my left-handed husband doesn't appreciate the one-sided design.  And after two months, there is still an "overheated plastic" odor when making a full pot. We're using it; the coffee is still better than we got from an inexpensive Mr. Coffee.  But I can't recommend it.

Title: I love my Nikon D50!  No more Point and Shoot for Me!
Content:
I am very much an amateur photographer but consider it one of my hobbies.  My subjects are always my children.  I previously owned a Nikon D70 and sold that for the Canon Rebel and then decided to go back to a point a shoot for portability. I was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures I was getting.  So...I went shopping for a new Digital SLR.  The D50 is perfect for me and within my budget. Actually it was sold out many places during the holiday.  I managed to find one locally and started shooting with it straight out of the box and it takes fantastic pictures!  Right now I have it in full auto mode but can't wait to start trying to shoot in manual mode.  I highly recommend this camera as an excellent DSLR for a beginner.  Not being a camera expert by any means, I was impressed by the quality of materials in the Nikon body as opposed to the Canon body but might just be my personal preference.

Title: perfect fit!
Content:
We recently bought an 84 year old home with a VERY decrepit fireplace chimney. It had a gas free standing "looks like a real fire"stove that stuck out about three feet int6o the small front room. The fireplace it self is beautiful brick work so we did not want to tear it out. We tried various ways to make it utile and finally stumbled on the DIMPLEX. It is everything we were looking for. It fit perfectly and looks real. I mean it really looks like a fire is going. Plus it is a  heater big enough to heat our little front room. it was easy to install and the delivery was VERY VERY fast! I am very impressed!

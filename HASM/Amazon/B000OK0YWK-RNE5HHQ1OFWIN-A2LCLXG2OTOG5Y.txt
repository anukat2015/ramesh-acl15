Title: I love my Zune!!
Content:
This is my second Zune, my son gave our first one a "bath" so here we are purchasing a second one. Our first was a 2nd generation 8G and it worked great until submerged in water, no suprise there. This is a 1st generation 30G. We love it, it held all our music plus we have room for more. Its easy to add and remove music, create play lists, navigate through both the Zune handheld and computer programs. I can't say anything negative about it. I think microsoft does a poor job marketing this product because I think it is superior to the IPOD and most people have never heard of Zune. I have helped family members program other mp3 players and the Zune is by far the best of them all.

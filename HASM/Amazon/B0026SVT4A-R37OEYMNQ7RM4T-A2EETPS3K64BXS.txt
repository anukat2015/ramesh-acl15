Title: Great purchase
Content:
Our daughter's room is the furthest room in the house with lots of windows so her room is much cooler than the rest of the house. We had to leave the heat on during the night just to keep her room warm. After a lot of research on what is the safest (fire hazard) and easiest to use, we chose this one. It's great - it definitely keeps the temperature in her room, it's not loud, oscillates and, is very easy to program. 
One note - when we first opened it, we did have to let it air out a bit since it had a strong "new" smell but after running it for a couple of days in another room, the smell went away.

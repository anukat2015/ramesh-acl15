Title: Apple Ipod Touch 16GB
Content:
Apple iPod touch 16 GB (2nd Generation)
I bought this for my 16 year old daughter as a Christmas present.  My older daughter has the 8GB Touch and so far they have been great.  Nice feature for them both is being able to access the internet while in their college classes.  They can get on the campus wifi and reference things and that has helped them in their classes, it's like having a mini laptop.
Would recommend.

Title: Zen MicroPhoto MP3 player a good value
Content:
I purchased this MP3 player after carefully comparing to othe MP3 players by other manufacturers.  The Zen Microphoto 8 GB player is not the best on the market nor does it have all the bells and whistles of some of the other players which cost quite a bit more but dollar for dollar it is a good buy. The user menu is intuitive and easy to learn. The unit seems fairly rugged. Mine has been dropped a couple of times but continues to work flawlessly. The Zen MicroPhoto gets one demerit in my book, however, because the touch pad is overly sensitive making operation a bit frustrating. Even setting the touch pad sensitivity to the lowest level does not resolve this problem. If you're looking for a good value in an MP3 player and don't need scores of gigabytes of storage, consider the Zen MicroPhoto 8 GB MP3 player.

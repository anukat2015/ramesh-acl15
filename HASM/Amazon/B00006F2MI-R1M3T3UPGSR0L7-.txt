Title: Overpriced Machine.
Content:
We've had our coffee maker for over a year now.  Good things:  It makes great coffee.  Looks good on the counter.  With the thermal carafe, the coffee doesn't taste burnt and stays hot for several hours.Bad things:  The coffee grinder gets wet and dirty after each use.  In our opinion, coffee doesn't taste as good using the machine's grinder. So, we just grind our coffee beans in our Krups grinder.  When the carafe is half full, it leaks when pouring.  May sound like a minor problem but gets annoying after sometime (especially when you have guests over).Overall, we like our machine but we wouldn't recommend it-- mostly because of the price.  Overpriced for the extras that seem useless(i.e. grinder!)or not superior.  Of course, if you have money to burn, this is good machine to own.

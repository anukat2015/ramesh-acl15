Title: Brilliant for the money
Content:
I didn't give this camera 5 stars but that's only because a couple of personal gripes that might not even bother another buyer.
My problems just stem from the fact that I owned the first digital rebel (300D) and I am used to a bigger bulkier body.
That was a issue with me but it's something easily overcome with some use.
Also, I thought the shutter is a little loud but again, it's not something that is a real issue with performance.
The things I am impressed with so far, is the large screen and the easy to see settings. would be good for people with issues seeing the small LCD screens on the other models.
the fast 3.5 fps was a factor I considered before purchase, my 300D, had 2.3fps and only for 4 shots. This model can shoot nearly endlessly at 3.5 fps, great for action/sports shots.
Ease of use is pretty good for the intermediate user, I found with a brief look at the manual I could use it up to the standard of my old camera. there is much more I can find but at least I can operate to a satisfactory level for now.
Live View is something I don't have an interest right now but I see advantages in this with tripod landscapes and group or portraits.
Over all I am very happy with the purchase and recommend this camera.

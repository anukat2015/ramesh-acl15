Title: Great for the gym!!
Content:
I can't add much that hasn't already been discussed but I will say the only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the lack of documentation! This is my first Ipod so everything wasn't so clear or obvious to me. Thankfully my tech savy kids got me up and running.
Come on Apple..... If people are going to spend big money on your products you can at least provide the proper instructions on how to use them!
With this being said...... for $175 you can't go wrong! I loaded 1000 songs and is only 1/4 full! This makes my workouts at the gym much more enjoyable. Go ahead and do it. You won't be disappointed!

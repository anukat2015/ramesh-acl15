Title: Fantastic
Content:
I love my Vornado.  It's quiet, very warm, and does, in fact, turn off when it gets too close to the wall.  My only complaint would be that I bought the item thinking it was made in America, but came to read on the box that it was "assembled" in the USA.  Nevertheless, it's a great value.

Title: Evidently I can not kill this little thing
Content:
I have had my shuffle for almost 1 year now. I use it for running and waiting in airports mainly. I have dropped it numerous times, lost it, soaked it with sweat repeatedly, and even stepped on it accidently. It still just keeps going and going. I am on my 2nd set of wrap aroung earphones (Sonys). It lives in my laptop bag and takes a daily beating in there too.
I see that they have gone down drastically in price from what I paid (~$80). I will buy another the same day this one finally gives up. What more could I say?

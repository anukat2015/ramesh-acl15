Title: bad choice
Content:
Just a month after I got x5, the wireless and wired network annoyed me a lot,  I had to spend lots of time to investigate why my network speed was getting slower and slower. At the beginning, I suspected my cable modem had issue, called isp to look into this, no issue at all. then swapped 4 routers trying to solve this problem, but still existed until I suspected my brand new Asus ul30-x5 notebook. So I connected my old notebook to the network, running for a whole day, there is no problem at all! I could not believe this result! But this wasn't the worst thing, the worst thing was when I connected this new notebook to network, the network connection got sharply slow down and AFFECTED THE OTHER COMPUTERS AND DEVICE-ROUTER's connection speed, that was the reason why I suspected my router and cable modem had issues. It was a really horrible thing I had never encountered before.By the way, It is not only a wireless issue, but it has wired network issue too. I am shocked......
Now, I am still waiting for their response after I sent the notebook to their service provider a week ago. Such a bad service!
And just called the customer service, they even don't have RMA trace system, so I don't know how long I have to wait!
I will keep away from ASUS for future purchase, it sucks!

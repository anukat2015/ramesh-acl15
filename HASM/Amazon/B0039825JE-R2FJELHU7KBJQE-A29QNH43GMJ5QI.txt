Title: What an amazing machine!
Content:
Wow! Talk about insane! Every game I have is cranked wide open on the graphics. I turned on every single feature and up to its max and have YET to see this machine sputter! WARNING: the Steam application DOES NOT work on Windows 7 64 bit!!!! If it did, Call of Duty Modern Warfare would rock! Everything else runs at or beyond crazy frame rates.
The fact this machine is missing PCMCIA and Firewire is no problem. In fact, as I understand it PCMCIA and Firewire actually take CPU cycles that would otherwise be spent on better things like graphics.
Editing full 1920x1080 HD video on Sony Vegas Pro was as close to real-time as you can get on a PC.
Sony Acid probably could have more tracks than you could count and still not miss a beat. VST instruments and effects had a delay nearly matching the MIDI processing delay which was breath-taking to witness.
This is my new carry-around with my M-Audio Torq / Xponent! Torq literally was next to real-time when syncing to MIDI. You talk about crazy? Ha, I will show you crazy; hook up my Roland MC-909 to Torq via Xponent and do real-time remixes, while running the light show all from my ROG laptop.
Now, why buy a smack-in-tosh? Ain't nuffin like that going on over there, friends. I use to be anti-microsoft but now I'm a PC! Asus, put me there! ROGs rule!

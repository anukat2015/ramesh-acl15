Title: Getting Back to Photography
Content:
The new Canon Digital Rebel XTi I just purchased has been great.  I have owned a Canon camera for close to 30 years, but discontinued most of my photography as a hobby due to the price of film and developing.  This new camera has enabled me to get back into a hobby I enjoy with some wonderful benefits that only a digital camera can bring. It has taken me some time to remember the techniques I learned years ago and apply them to this new type of photography. Being able to take endless shots of a subject has distinct advantages, as does being able to see the results instantly.  The speed of the camera is fantastic.  There was no way a power winder on my old film Canon could take shots the way this Rebel does. It brings about a whole new meaning to photography.  Rob McIntosh

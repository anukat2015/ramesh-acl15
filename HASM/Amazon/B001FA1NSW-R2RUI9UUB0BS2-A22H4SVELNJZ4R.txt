Title: Happy!!!
Content:
First of all the product arrived in record time!
I immediately went about downloading my music then I ran out of space and it was then I realized that the memory capacity seem to be less than 1GB and additionally much of the space was taken up with something called other files.  After googling I discovered that by restoring the ipod it would free up the space... had to do it twice which meant loading the music again. Hence the 4 stars.  But alll in all I'm happy with this ipod it's so easy to carry and perfect for walking/jogging and the .  I'll be needing a 4GB soon!

Title: Good music player, and thats all
Content:
I've had my ipod touch for a little over a year and I have found the player to be a big pain in the [...]. first you need to update the itunes application seem like once every two months and the updates are huge, which is a problem for me since I have wireless internet. in addition It also wants to installed quick time which for me realy serves no purpose. and the hardware worked great for about 6 months then my headphone jack started to cracke, so I got an exchange at the apple store, however the replacement worked fined for about 4 months and then the internet started to just freeze for no reason. as far as Im concern the apple ipods are junk that just required too many updates and also firmware updates at a cost of about 10 dollar per update, where dose it stop? 
If you are thinking about getting one I would say see if you can get something better from Sony or some other brand you will usualy get more for your HD space for your money and excellent features.

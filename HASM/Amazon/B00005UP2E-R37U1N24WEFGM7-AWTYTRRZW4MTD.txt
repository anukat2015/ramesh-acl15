Title: Awesome! Just a note about carpets and dogs...
Content:
It works on -some- carpets. I have several throw carpets in the house, this vacuum works on the flat low pile carpets just fine, but it is useless on plush high pile carpets. 
But it is the ABSOLUTE BEST for hardwood. It gets dirt up that my upright just passed over and even cleaned up construction dust! I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't such a pain to pick the dog hair out of the bristles when I finish. 
One last thing for fearful dog owners, my dog is a bit of a scaredy cat and would always attack the upright, but has no problems with this vacuum. In fact, she even let me vacuum her! LOL Yay for less dog hair around the house!

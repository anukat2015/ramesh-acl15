Title: Great quality portable interchangeable lens camera
Content:
When I do not feel like carrying my heavy SLR camera and lenses, I take my Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 instead.  With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens.  Of course, the G1's 12 megapixel sensor cannot compete with the A900's 24 megapixel sensor, and the 14-45 lens is not nearly as fast as the 24-70 lens, but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900.  The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap.  And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders is a convenient alternative if you don't want a camera strap around your neck.
If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like, this review would be rather long, so here is a short list of my favorite features:
1. All of the buttons that control focus, metering, ISO, etc. are well positioned and easy to use.
2. A real time histogram may be displayed if desired.
3. In manual focus mode, the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved.
4. If desired, images may be stored in RAW format in addition to the limiting JPEG format.
A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography.  However, the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras remedies this problem.
For those who would like to capture video, the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video, Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD are attractive alternatives.  But I don't shoot video, so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera.

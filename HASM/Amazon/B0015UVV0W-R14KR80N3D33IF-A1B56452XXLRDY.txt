Title: Space Heated
Content:
I bought the Touchstone for my home office. It's a decent space to heat but I wanted to heat only that space rather then heating my whole house. The Vornado does the job. It produces a good amount of heat fairly quickly. The room gets comfortably warm in a matter of minutes. Perhaps about 10 minutes for a 10X12 room with a 8' ceiling. The heater is pretty quiet, I know it's there but it is not enough to disturb me while I am working. The remote and digital display are kind of unnecessary. In retrospect I would have bought a unit that does not have those features, if I could save money. This unit is pretty pricey. It works well, does the job but, is $$$.

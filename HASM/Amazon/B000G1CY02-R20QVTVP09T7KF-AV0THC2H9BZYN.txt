Title: A Real Good Heater
Content:
Hmmm, I have a Kenwood heater with the same design, same features, so I have to wonder if this unit is the same as the Kenwood unit? If not, this one is about $10 cheaper. 
Anyway, I've had the heater for two months now and it works as well as my previous heater, an oil-filled unit that lasted about five years before it quietly gave up the ghost. I hope this wall mounted heater will last as long.
So far, I like it very much although there are a couple of things that make this heater a little less than perfect: 1) while it has no fan to make a noise, it does make a little noise anyway although it's just a low poping sound every once in a while and 2) is a annoying design flaw where the control knobs are to the right of the unit, so that when the heater is on, one has to reach across the front of it to adjust the knobs. That, of course, can get kinda hot. The knobs should have been to the left, but I guess this is nitpicking a bit.
I gave it five stars because so far, it has worked very well. If it continues, I'd say the five stars are an apt rating. But if it breaks down in another few months like so many of the previous heaters I've bought, I'll be glad to change the rating. But as far as I can tell right now, this is a very good heater and I recommend it to anyone looking for a space heater that can be easily wall mounted and kept out of the way. 
One last thing though: when mounted on the wall, the wall does get fairly warm after a while. I don't know if this is a potential problem, but I suppose it wouldn't last long on the market if it is.

Title: Relief!
Content:
We live in a condominium building whose heating system blows hot air from the vents. It is very dry, feels unhealthy, and actually gives me a queasy stomach.  Most of the time we don't have to turn the heat on at all because the warmth from surrounding apartments is sufficient. But my rather small study has always been a problem because, with cross-ventilation, it can get quite drafty. I had just about given up when I decided to buy this DeLonghi TRD0715T Safe Heat-Oil-Filled Radiator. I was immediately impressed.  The warmth it produces is so much more pleasant, and it is sufficient for my study, especially when, on very cold days, I shut the door. Generally, once the room heats up, I can turn the heater back to #1 or, occsionally, on #2 for most of the day and late into the evening. I grew up with radiator heating and didn't appreciate how effective a system it was. Now I know!

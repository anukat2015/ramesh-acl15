Title: Waste
Content:
I live in Arizona where its dry people say this works in dry places honestly no difference if i know what i know now i wouldnt have paid $15 bucks for this ur better off just spending three to four hundred bucks for a air cooler the only good thing about this unit is that it is quiet cause the motor doesnt push air, the high speed felt like a low air speed low was almost off..

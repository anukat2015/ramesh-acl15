Title: crash central
Content:
I had high hopes for gaming in 3d. especially Battlefield Bad Company 2
Unfortunately I kept getting the blue screen crash for hardware problems.
In addition it ran very very hot.
When I called Asus their only answer was to wipe the hard drive and start over.
Since I had only had the computer a few days that seemed futile so I returned the
computer to Amazon and am out the $42.00 in shipping and insurance.
Maybe I had a lemon, I hope so for Asus's sake

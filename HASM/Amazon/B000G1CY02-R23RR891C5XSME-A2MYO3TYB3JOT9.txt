Title: Disappointed with this Highly-Rated Heater
Content:
I bought this heater one year ago. We have been using it reguarly in the evenings this fall and it has been working fine. Recently it started sparking and shooting out flames when turned on high. Tonight it stopped working altogether. I would have expected more from a heater in this price range and with such high ratings. I don't think it is safe.

Title: 2months with it and still loving it
Content:
I got this ZEN because i liked the design better than iPod's and at first view it does have more functionalities at a lower price. Yes, everytime I show it around people think my 'iPod' is bigger than normal because it's not as thin but aside from that looks better and works perfectly for me, havent had any trouble with it just yet, in fact I was just in a class where I used it to record my teacher's speech so I can review the whole thing later on again. I have also watched movies in it when I'm travelling and the quality of its screen its as good as my friends' iPods (if not better). It's really easy to put music in there too because of the friendly software and you can even use windows media player to do the same and sync it.

Title: Piece of S***
Content:
If I could use "zero" stars I would have. I have a small pickup truck.
I bought this product to bypass a non functioning heater core problem.
I guess it would heat up my cab if I lived in Florida or on the equator!!! It is next to useless. I live in Missouri and while I didn't expect to be toasty, I at least expected not to still be able see my breath in my truck! Candles in a coffee can would work just as well.  LOL (not really!) So, save your hard earned dinero and give this one a pass.

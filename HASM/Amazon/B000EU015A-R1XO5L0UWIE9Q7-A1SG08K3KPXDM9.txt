Title: Loud and for no reason.
Content:
This vacuum  is a very light duty with no suction to mention. If it were not for the free gift certificate I used to pay for half the purchase it would not have been worth the price.The supposed washable filter is a paper product and it does not hold up well to washing and expands so much it cuts off even more of the suction.Target is not a place to buy something from online. It took two full weeks to receive and was in a soft sided box that was demolished. Basically 66 dollars for the entire with shipping for a 20 dollar vacuum. Would be better to take a drive to good will and buy an old used shopvac and save your money. It is very very LOUD!

Title: Apple IPod Video Player(Black 5.5 Generation)
Content:
This IPod is great!  Very customer friendly. Easy to sync, easy to load, easy to use.
The sound quality is AMAZING, however, I do not personally care for the earbuds that come with it. They are too big and do not stay secure in my ears, so I will be purchasing some other kind in the near future.
I purchased a refurbished model of this IPod and found the description to be very honest and detailed.
The only thing that wasn't mentioned was that there were quite a few tiny scratches(from previous usage) on the back of the casing. Otherwise it was in perfect conditon and packaged nicely.
Thank you, Amazon for a terrific buying experience! I will not hesitate to do further business with you in the future!!!

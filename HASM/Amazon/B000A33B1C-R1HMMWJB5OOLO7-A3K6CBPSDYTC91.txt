Title: DeLonghi TRD0715T
Content:
A gentle and efficient heater, the TRD0715T was truly an essential addition to our household this wicked cold January 2010.  With space at a premium in our art studio, we needed an auxiliary heater with a small footprint, and that could be utilized in close proximity to a lot of flammable substances.  This heater radiated enough heat to keep our 13' X 20' room not toasty, but comfortable enough to continue our projects even through the coldest of the cold spell.  Without this heater, we would not have been able to use the room at all.  We turned the thermostat to the low setting at night, and it barely simmered, then raised the temp during the day.  We did not use the included timer, as the thermostat did a good job of regulating the temperature.  The unit never became too hot to touch, was never noisy and only exhibited the "new" smell for the first couple of days.  I am very glad that we now own this heater, which appears sturdy and solid, built to last many years and kinda attractive too.  When heating season ends, and it is time to find a storage spot for the heater, I will be glad that it is small and easy to stow for next year.
By the way, I purchased this heater through Amazon in the midst of the coldest spell when every other seller I explored was sold out of heaters and backordered, with a 3 week possible delivery date.  Amazon delivered in 3 days!

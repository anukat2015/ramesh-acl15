Title: Great Value, Better than most
Content:
I picked this up the other day to replace my Mr. Coffee programmable/insulated carafe coffee maker (that one just stopped working after 8 mos.  As an aside, I will never buy Mr. Coffee again). I have been using it for a week.
I went shopping for higher-end/more expensive coffee makers but ended up coming home with this one.  I'll just hit the bullet points:
- easy to operate
- keeps coffee at drinkable temperature for 2 1/2 hours.  If you pre-heated the carafe I am sure you could extend it.  At 2.5 hours the coffee is just over luke-warm so if you have to always have piping hot coffee, you should get one with a burner that stays on. I can't stand burnt coffee, so anything that continues to add heat after brewing doesn't do it for me.
- Makes coffee just as good as anything I have used.  I use 6 TBS of fresh ground coffee per full pot.
-the auto timer took me an extra 30 secs to figure out...you would expect the LED next to the "Auto" button to light up when that mode is on.  What actually happens is a little dot appears on the upper right of the time display.
-easy to clean, and NO DRIPS from the carafe.  One of my peeves is carafes that dribble as you pour.  This one is well engineereed.
If you are value conscious and in the market for an 8 cup thermal, I'd recommend this one.  For the money it can't be beat.
My coffee profile:
-I buy Kirkland Starbucks Roast at Costco and drink 3 cups a day.
-Coffee is a morning ritual, and also a vice.  I love my coffee.
-I don't go to Starbucks/Peets/etc. unless out with others, and then I drink the "COD" (coffee of the day).
-I like a smooth columbian cup with a splash of 1/2 and 1/2. All the time.  No flavored, No caffe-latte-crema-cappo-mocha-chino-shine-ola for me.
-I can detect burnt coffee a mile away, just the smell of it puts me off.
-I am willing to pay $[...] for a coffee maker, but I shop on best value, not sleekest machine.
If you have a similar profile, then this review may be for you.

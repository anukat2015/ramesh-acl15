Title: Great for wood floors!!
Content:
I bought this canister vacuum for use on my wood floors.  It's perfect for them!  The filter needs to be emptied more often than some other models, but it's still worth it.  There are no bags to purchase.  This vacuum isn't my favorite for rugs or carpeting, but it does fine for the smaller jobs.  I recommend this machine for anyone needing better suction on their hardwood or laminate flooring.

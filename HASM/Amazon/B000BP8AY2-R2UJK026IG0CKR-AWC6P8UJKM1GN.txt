Title: awesome buy, i definately recomend it
Content:
I wanted an affordable MP3 player that could hold a lot of songs, but I didn't want any sort of bargain basement stuff that would break within a few days. This holds an impressive amount of songs (way more than it predicted I could, even in MP3 format) for a great price from a reliable company. You don't even have to be technology savy and the manual clearly illustrates how to do everything with the player. The one I was sent happened to be defective, but that can happen to anyone with any product. The people at SanDisk patiently helped me by phone for 15 minutes before telling me that they would cover the cost of me shipping it back to them and that they would send me a new one for  free - they didn't even care that I had since thrown away all the packaging and instruction manuals. 
The product is great and really delivers. Its easy to use, well worth the cost, and really helps kill time during workouts.
And as for my oringal defective player, I get the feeling from other friends who use SanDisk products that the incident was a fluke, definately not the usual. So don't let that deter you. Besides, if you ever do have a problem, the SanDisk people will pleasantly and patiently help you out.

Title: Good at first...
Content:
I received this heater 10/21. I used it every day for about 2 hours total time. It unfortunately was dead by 12/27. 
It was nice while it lasted, but 2 months? I will update post after contacting manufacturer. 
It was portable, extremely bright light (as noted), but put out nice heat if you were directly in front of it. My cats already miss it.

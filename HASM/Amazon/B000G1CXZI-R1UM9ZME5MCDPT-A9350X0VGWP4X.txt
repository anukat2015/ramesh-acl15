Title: Much too noisy
Content:
Look, I'm not sure why people are complaining that this heater doesn't have a fan or can't heat up a stadium.  This is a small oil filled heater with no fan.  Don't want that... don't buy it.  
The real problem I have is that it clicks constantly.  I bought this for a baby's room where I need quiet, even, safe heat.  You turn it on and the noise starts as the element heats up... click... click... click... click...  Baby then turns around, starts to get restless, and the screaming could start at any minute. 
I've used cheap oil filled heaters in the past and they did not have this problem.  When I pay a premium for a brand name and supposedly quality design, I expect better than what DeLonghi has provided here.  It should not take an engineering genius to realize that heat causes metal to expand and take it into account when designing the product.
Disappointing.  Very disappointing.

Title: Dont waste ur money
Content:
I dont think this is worth the cost and u can find better product for this cost. 
No feature to see which song its playing , no option to move to desired song ( just press next,next..in sequencial and in random u just have to listen whatever is plays), no drag drop facility have to use itunes, itunes tied to specific pc,just 1gb ,etc,etc and i can keep on listing.
The two star is given for its compact , sound quality and if you pause and switch off in middle and start again it resumes properly otherwise 1 star
I may suggest this for $5-10 not for $45...

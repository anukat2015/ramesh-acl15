Title: not much power to it
Content:
ok, my expectations may be too high, but i have a 20 year old 1500 watt heater from sears that produces a lot of heat.  this mini tower did not throw off much heat.  most of the heat came from the top of the heater, not out the 360degree vents.  i placed it in a 10 x 15 room with low ceilings and after an hour idid not feel an appreciable difference in room temp.  our little sears heater gets the room sooo hot after only 10 minutes.  maybe the new heaters are safer though.  can't start a fire easily with this little heater.  good safety features and easy to use.
i ended up returning it in search of something that produces more heat.  this would be good in a really small space like a bathroom.

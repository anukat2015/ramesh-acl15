Title: The 'dream' machine!!
Content:
Although the previous reviewer was (technically) correct, for all intents and purposes you can shut off the heater/fan without unplugging it.  Simply turn the heating element off and turn the thermostat down as far as it will go (44 degrees F).  The red light will remain on but that is simply to let you know the machine is receiving current.
We are having a cold snap, so I was pleased the heater arrived when it did.  I ordered it since I was unprepared to pay the 49% increase in my utility rates brought about by the natural (and unnatural) disasters of hurricanes, incompetent politicians and administrators, and the greed of 'big' oil.
Considering all the bells and whistles this little machine has, it is astonishingly light weight (I would say no greater than 2-3 lbs.).  Therefore, it is very easy to tote around if you are going to be in a certain part of the house or apartment for very long.  Mine has been running, intermittantly, for a couple days now.  The plug area is warm when the heater is running, but not hot, so I don't believe I have any electrical fire hazzard issues.
Needless-to-say, at less than $14, this is one of those unusually good bargains that one frequently encounters on the Amazon site.  Way to go DeLonghi and Amazon!

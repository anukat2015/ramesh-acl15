Title: Farberware percolator
Content:
I've used and enjoyed the 4 cup and 8 cup Farberware percolators for over ten years but due to a recent and potentially dangerous mishap have decided to find another coffee machine.  About 3 weeks ago I plugged in my 4 cup percolator only to have it immediately spew a rocket like emission of flames into my kitchen - literally a 4 foot stream of fire!  Black burning bits of plastic flew across the room.  My husband saw the flames from the other room - ran in, unplugged it and threw it in the sink.  I have since contacted Farberware who has sent me paid postage to return the percolator for examination.  The woman on the phone could offer no explanation.  Let me also add that this particular machine was not even a year old.  Very scary.

Title: The 40D is a great camera
Content:
I put a deposit on the 40D two days after it was announced and picked up my camera last week. I have the 5D and just sold my 30D after a few days with the new 40D. I'm a Sports Photographer for the most part, and the 3 FPS on the 5D just didn't feel adequate to me.
My first experience with the 40D taught me to use K5200 for white balance indoor, and to make sure I'm not overexposed on my shots. Outdoor shots are beautiful, as are properly exposed indoor shots. Overexposed shots indoors have a ulgy yellow cast to them, I had to learn the camera. 
I really love the menu system on the 40D, it's so much easier & quicker then what's on the my 5D, it felt comfortable right away.
The AF-ON button for tracking action shots is wonderful, and worth the money for the camera by itself.
The image quality on the 40D is excellent, IMHO better then the 30D which is why I sold mine right away.I wanted a better camera for fast action that had picture quality like the 5D. The 40D is pretty close, nothing quite equals the 5D images ( I don't have the Mark 111 ). As far as comparing it to Nikon's D300 coming out, I just sold all my Nikon gear to switch to Canon low noise images. Now Nikon addresses the noise issue by coming out with the D300, for me it's too late. I have excellent Canon L lens and two great cameras, I'm satisfied.

Title: garbage
Content:
I can't believe how much I spent for this horrible machine. The internal grinder needs to be THOROUGHLY cleaned with each use or it clogs. Furthermore, the trip mechanism that directs the brewed coffee into the carafe also needs to be cleaned constantly; If you don't---you'll have coffee and grounds diverted from the carafe and all over your counter top, floor, etc. Loads of fun. Also, even when working properly, the grinder is too small to accommodate enough beans for the ten-cup carafe, unless you like coffee weaker than I do. I'll never buy a Cuisinart product again.

Title: college review
Content:
Ive been a happy owner for the past couple of weeks and the pros outnumber the cons by a lot.  to begin the first thing i noticed was the insanely thin posture of the laptop.  without the battery (which i LOVE using it that way) this baby weights just about the same as a notebook and a lot less than a textbook.  without and optical drive i would say its a little hard to install things n it but hey, who needs an optical drive when i can download pretty much anything off the internet nowadays.  the only true complaint i have is that the internet wireless is a little slower than my other computer.  but i gotta say the other one is 3times more expensive than this one.  this beauty gives me in quiet office setting about 11 hours of battery life.  its just insane how i stay in the library for hours and everyone looks for a plug after like 2 hours but i am happy.  away from the crowds i just find myself a quiet place and read off this baby or just play games which i enjoy.  
the keyboard is a little different but its sweet to type with.
the mouse pad was the hardest thing to get used to not only because its so sensitive is not even funny.  it did not work at first but then i realized i was actually pressing on too hard.  yes too hard.  you gotta understand this is a very thin and light machine, any sudden move or hard hit will put it out of its misery.  dont take this as a negative thing cuz the macbook air is even worse.  talking about macbook air this baby weights about the same and does about the same performance for uh... a quarter of the price?

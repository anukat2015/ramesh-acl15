Title: Real notebook, not netbook
Content:
I was struggle for getting a notebook or cheap netbook. This notebook is only 3 lb with full size keyboard and soild built. With win7 preinstall, turn on time is 27 second before install all crazy microsoft auto updates, and 35-40 second after. Even with 2Gb Ram you can still run photoshop. The only problem I is when I use Endnote(for managing reference) cite whil you write function, computor was slow.

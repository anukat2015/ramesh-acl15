Title: Great sorta.
Content:
My mini was 6-stars-cool-completly-awesome, beyond all my expectations.  I used it almost all day every work day, and in the car, and in the garden, and in bed, and... I loved it.  Until it died.  In fact, -+*everyone*+- I know with a mini has **sent it back**.  They're not all that reliable when they're not dead.  If you're one of the lucky ones that hasn't had the crackly death you can expect a solid 12 months with your mini until you need a $100 battery.  I've taken my $ elsewhere.  It's sad because it was my friend.

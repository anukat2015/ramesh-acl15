Title: Nice lower-priced computer, but.....
Content:
Less than a week after purchase I lost the $ key. I contacted Acer, and was told to 'send it in for repairs'. I requested a replacement keyboard instead, and was refused. A local computer store said it would be $200 to replace the keyboard (!). So, I ordered one on Ebay, and did it myself with no problems.
Bottom line... it is a cheap computer. But, if you want something simple and easy to use, it's not a bad purchase.

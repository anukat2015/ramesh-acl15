Title: 18months on, time for a review
Content:
I have had this camera with the 14-50 Leica kit lens for 18months now. I have seen many new cameras being released every season, with higher mega-pixels, more features, newer technology. But I have still managed to keep this and I can tell you that every day with this camera makes you a better photographer. Using the camera with a good lens makes you really think about the picture before clicking. Its is limited in specs and the high ISO performance isn't stellar. But that aside, this camera has some very innovative features (for its time). In basic photography terms, it has every thing you would need to compose and take great pictures, without all the other gadgets and features that take you away from the photography.
Yes, the camera is now pretty dated, but at 7.5 MP, its still produces stunning pictures along with its Leica Kits lens. It also pairs nicely with the Leica 25mm Summilux and The Olympus 70-300mm lens. 
What I have a unique camera, with a unique design, sturdy build and great picture quality for daylight and twilight photography. For night photography, a good tripod and some patience will stil produce stellar results without having to resort to noisy high ISOs. All in all, a nice camera to own and keep!
Plus, I get more compliments carrying this camera than would any Nikon or Canon user and in some vain manner, its a nice feeling to be a snobby elite :)

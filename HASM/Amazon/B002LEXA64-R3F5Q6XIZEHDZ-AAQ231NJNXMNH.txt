Title: Great Laptop!
Content:
This laptop arrived in the allotted time period. It is exactally what I wanted. It can do basic functions well i.e. web, email, and word processing. It can handle YouTube HD on NOT full screen. I don't find this a big loss regular YouTube is fine. It will not play games newer than say 2004-2005 one exception is Spore, google a list a tested titles. Most older games I played work fine.
Most definately worth the money!

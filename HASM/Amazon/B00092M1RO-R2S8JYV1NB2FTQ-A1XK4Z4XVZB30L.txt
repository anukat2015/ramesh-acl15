Title: Pretty good
Content:
Pluses - The deciding factor for me to get this was the AA battery .. my Panasonic with it's AAA using rechargable batteries lasts about 45 minutes .. so I really like the AA .. not sure why more mp3's dont use it.   Another plus my XP computer loaded the mp3 players as a drive and I could drop and drag my songs into the player ... No special software to check in songs I already have (unlike the Panasonic).  Sound is good with a very good set of headsets.  Is very easy to use if you just want to play music while working out .. I use shuffle feature for random play.  I don't need them sorted.  If I did this player may not sort properly from what I've read.
Minus - well , sort of ... I guess none are perfect. How funny. A big metal screw which requires a screw driver to hold battery cover.  Mine also broke right away .. but I just put a rubber band around it .. so it's no problem.  The cover just protects the battery, not hold it in place.

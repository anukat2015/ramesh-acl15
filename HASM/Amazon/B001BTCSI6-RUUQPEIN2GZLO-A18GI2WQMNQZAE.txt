Title: My favorite camera
Content:
Over the last 50 plus years I have owned and used a box Brownie, a Kodak 120 folding camera, a Graflex, three Leicas (2 of which were IIIgs), a Canon AE-1, a Nikon N70, a Nikon N80, a Nikon D100, and a Nikon D200.  This is the first camera I have really liked since the Leica IIIg.  I have been using it with the 24-70mm f2.8 lens and the picture quality is excellent.  
Other reviews will give you more details and comparisons.  I will simply say that this is the first camera since the Leica IIg that puts all the controls that I actually use at my fingertips.  Combining that with the bright, clear, viewfinder I feel comfortable with the camera and can concentrate on composing the photograph.
The only shortcoming that I have noticed is that occasionally photos seem overexposed by half a stop.  That is a subjective impression and since I always do a lot of post processing it does not matter much.  I have not conducted exhaustive tests but the tendency to overexpose seems to disappear if I shift from matrix metering to center weighted metering. 
I doubt that I will ever upgrade this body.  Instead I will invest in lenses.

Title: Coffee Lover? Don't bother with this one.
Content:
If you really enjoy your coffee, but think you can handle this little maker for emergency, travel, or office/workshop, it may NOT be worth a try. However, at less than 10 dollars, you can get coffee out of it and by using an additional filter and strong beans, you may be able to slow it down enough to get a half decent cup. You can use your own cup if the plastic one included doesn't suit you. It is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick, weak coffee one cup at a time.

Title: broan kickspace heater used in bathroom
Content:
Great product! Heater tucks neatly into kickspace of our bathroom vanity. Opening for unit easily cut out with a dremel. Electrician hardwired it. We opted for a timer switch in the wall rather than a thermostat switch as we only are using it when we shower. Put it on before your shower and come out to a nice warm bathroom!

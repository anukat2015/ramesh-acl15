Title: Apple Ipod Mini
Content:
I am very please with my Ipod Mini.  I did not think I needed a 20-40gig hard drive and a color screen was not that important so I think my 6GB is great.  It is small and easy to operate while working out at the gym.  I also got the ITrip FM Tranmitter so I can play through my desk radio at work or in the car.  My only complaint is the battery life.  I can almost play it continuously for 8 hours at work but I was sold that it had an 18hour life(maybe in standby).

Title: This is a smart heater
Content:
I had already purchased on of these heaters and was quite happy with it so I purchased another from Amazon. I am happy with it and would recommend both to you. These heaters have saved me a lot of money on the heating expenses. I live alone so this is how I work it. Each morning I put the forced gas hot air system on until the temperature reaches about 70, then use the space heaters to heat my personal environment. This works fine and I am more than comfortable.   
When I have company, on goes the furnace.

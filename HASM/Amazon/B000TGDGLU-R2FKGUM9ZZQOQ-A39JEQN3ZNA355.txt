Title: Lower your oil heat bills; stay warmer
Content:
This is my second DeLonghi oil-filled heater. I purchased the first last winter and it worked out really well.  As the oil price climbs this is cost effective heating supplement for the room(s) I am using.  I keep my whole (hot air heated) house at 60 degrees.  This unit provides the incremental comfort I need at night sitting watching TV, reading or working on my PC.  Ideal uses: quickly taking off the chill or warming a small to medium sized room up to 10 degrees more than the whole-house temp.  Never a quality or other problem with this unit or my previous one.  Highly recommended and GREAT VALUE!

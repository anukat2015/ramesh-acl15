Title: Pretty in pink!
Content:
The primary reason I decided to purchase an mp3 player was so I could listen to music at the gym.  The iPod mini was definitely the best way to go.  It's incredibly small and lightweight, but the control buttons are still large enough to operate with ease and the screen is big enough to see clearly without having to squint.  I like the way the iPod mini has the control buttons right on the click wheel...it's much easier to operate than the original iPod.In addition to its compact size, the mini has all the cool features of the larger iPod, including a backlit screen, full song list display, and many more.  I haven't utelized the contacts option yet or played any games, but it's nice to have those options at my fingertips.  The mini comes with a secure belt clip, a very nice pair of earbud headphones, a cable to connect the iPod to your computer, and a cable to connect the iPod to the outlet charger (also included).  The iTunes program is incredibly easy to use, and you can download music very quickly.  The only real complaint I have about the mini is that it should be priced a bit lower, considering that for $50 more you can buy the 15GB iPod, which holds four times as many songs as the iPod mini.  However, I think you really have to think about what you're going to use your iPod for.  In my case, I wanted the most lightweight model to take with me when I work out, so the mini was definitely the best choice (and 1,000 songs is still quite a lot, believe me!).  Still, I think Apple should lower the price.Finally, the best thing about the iPod mini is that it comes in a variety of colors.  I have received many compliments on my pink mini: it's very fashionable!

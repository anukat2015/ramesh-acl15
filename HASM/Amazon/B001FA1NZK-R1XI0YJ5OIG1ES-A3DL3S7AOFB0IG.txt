Title: Not for Middle-aged eyes
Content:
I thought seriously enough about buying this when it came out that I went to an Apple store so I could actually handle it, since I had been lusting after one. I'm 55, and I sadly came to the conclusion that the screen, even with the enlargement feature, was too small for persons with bifocals.
Print was just too small to be comfortable reading. I wound up purchasing a Nokia 810 Internet tablet, which has the same portability as the touch (it fits in my handbag or a man's jacket pocket) and does many of the same things. Plus, it has a real keyboard and a larger screen.

Title: Good, Bad & Ugly
Content:
It works REALLY WELL.  
Downside?  
Consumes a lot of electricity - so use on the really cold nights.  Not for full-time, sole heating use, in my opinion, but still cheap as a spot heater, when needed.
Noise? Not too bad, and not nearly as loud as other reviews have noted.  Acceptable.
We looked and looked, comparing numerous products, and frankly, we're very satisfied.
Quality?  Good.  Well made and a bargain at this price when compared to more expensive, feature-deprived competitors.
Oh, it's NOT ugly.  :-)  Fits most rooms' decor.

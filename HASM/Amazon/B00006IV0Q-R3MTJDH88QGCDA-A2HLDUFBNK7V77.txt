Title: Easy, Not Great Coffee!
Content:
I just received this pot about 4 days ago. It is sturdy and has a nice, sleek design. It is easy to use, except the stem is difficult to keep standing up while you put the basket in. Overall, good design. My biggest complaint is that the coffee is NOT STRONG. I keep adding more and more coffee in it and its still not strong and has a bitter after taste. It makes very hot coffee but if you leave it plugged in, within 45 minutes you will have the classic burnt coffee taste. I love perked coffee and Im going to keep adjusting the coffee amount and brand on this one. I have an old 1930's Farberware that actually makes much better coffee.

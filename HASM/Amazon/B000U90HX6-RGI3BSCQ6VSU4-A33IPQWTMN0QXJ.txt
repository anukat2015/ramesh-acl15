Title: Underachiever
Content:
I purchased this heater in hopes of heating a 20 x 10 area in my basement that was just refinished.  It does a poor job concentrating the heat only in an area of about 5 X 10 feet in front of the heater.  The temperature then drops off sharply.  I would not recommend this heater for a large area or an area that is not well insulated.

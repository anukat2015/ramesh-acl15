Title: Outstanding DSLR; read manual to get the best out of it.
Content:
The 50D is an outstanding camera; I have owned several of the "crop" cameras including the XT, XSi, 40D, etc.  The new 50D was a worthwhile upgrade for me. The LCD is a huge improvement; the extra MPs give you a lot of cropping room.  The camera focuses quickly, is accurate and provides a very high image quality.  There are so many choices to be made for shooting modes that you really need to read through the manual to understand them.  Do you want the sharpening done more in-camera--read the manual.  Do you want to change the saturation, colors, etc?  Read the manual.  Live View is an option here, as is microadjusting.  This feature alone would be worth the upgrade for me.  The 50D really shows off the superior lens and is an excellent DSLR--I have now owned it for several months and like it more than I did when I first starting using it. I love the way the 50D feel in my hands - solid and very tactile.  She's a keeper.  A very good value in my opinion for a camera that can deliver professional results.  This 50D paired with a good quality lens will give you results you are proud of.

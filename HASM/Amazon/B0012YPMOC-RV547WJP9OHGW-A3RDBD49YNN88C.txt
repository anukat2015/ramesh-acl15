Title: don't buy
Content:
i ordered zen 4gb from amazon on 12/4. it would not charge up on my computer.creative tecnical tried to help however deemed it defective and told me to return. amazon sent me another unit.it played well for a week and then went blank. i had to return and i am now ordering an ipod nano 4gb. i had previously ordered and returned 2 creative zen v and they were both defective. steer clear of creative.they are a small company and rumor has it when you buy with a promotion,they send you refurbished units which break after a few weeks use. thank god for amazon's return policies.

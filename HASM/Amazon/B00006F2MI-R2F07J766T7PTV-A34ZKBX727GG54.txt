Title: Fresh ground cup of Joe
Content:
As Henry Ward Beecher is quoted "No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils".
We're fresh coffee lovers. A good day should start with a good cup of FRESH Coffee. Our G&B 600 in plastic went on the fritz after 2 years so the Brushed Chrome was our next step.  If you can stand the sound of jet engines waking you up (grinding your coffee), love the smell of fresh ground coffee, and the taste of a fresh cup of joe...then the DGB-600BC is a great machine!  You need to clean the unit after each use for consistent coffee though we'd love a self-cleaning unit.  The new metal pot does hold the coffee hot longer but it pours slower than the old glass carafe. Knowing we won't break the metal carafe is peace of mind as we taped/glued/rigged the glass one until the new unit came in.  Happy with the new DGB G&B but did like that the glass one held 12 cups instead of 10 cups and poured quicker. Can live with the few differences as per before that cup of coffee we're pretty klutzy.

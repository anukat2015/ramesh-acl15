Title: more than a floor cleaner...
Content:
I got this vacuum for my mother a year and a half ago and it is one of her top three ever. It is quiet and powerful and comes with a variety of toys as well as the ability to expand and contract to almost any crevice we need. It is not that heavy and the bags are not hard to find or very expensive and the sbag clinic bags are the best because if you are having hard times with breathing air you can leave the vacuum running or walking around with it over your shoulders for a while and it is more than a vacuum, it is an air cleaner!

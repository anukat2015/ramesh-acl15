Title: Cool
Content:
I like this camera a lot, takes great quality pictures. Still trying to figure out how to use it properly. I have to keep going to "clear camera settings" to put it back to the default settings cos i mess it up so much. lol. It'll take a little while to learn how to use all the manual stuff, but it's fun so i don't mind :)
Point and shoot just seems so boring now!

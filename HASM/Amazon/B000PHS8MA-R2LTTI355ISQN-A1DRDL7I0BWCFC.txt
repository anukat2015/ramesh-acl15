Title: So far, so good...
Content:
While I could have opted for a player with a bit more space to take on my workouts/runs (2gb+) or one that includes FM radio or a voice recorder, I purchased the Stone for the basic function of holding a good amount of music (64kbp WMA files means around 500 songs, or 30+ hours of music...which is plenty for a MP3 player smaller than my two thumbs put together).  It is small and well-designed, has great sound quality, and is very inexpensive.  Since it has the ability to skip through folders, despite its lack of an LCD screen, the ability to shuffle through all music OR listen to an album/playlist at a time is all there.  Well worth the money I spent.

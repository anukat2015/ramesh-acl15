Title: Got this over the XSi
Content:
I debated on getting this or the XSi, and went with this.  It's 100 bucks cheaper, and this was my first DSLR.  I didn't need the bigger screen or the extra MP.  What I don't like about this camera is the fact it won't accept a wireless shutter remote.  Other than that, I am happy with my first DSLR.  If you were to get a DSLR just to replace your point and shoot or your first DSLR, this is your camera.

Content:
Cord doesn't stay out.  Filters need to be cleaned after every use.   The cannister fills up quickly.  Only pros are the price and it is very lightweight.  Only okay on hard floors and does a terrible job on carpets.   Doesn't pick up small food items (ie. cheerios or cherrio pieces).  I wouldn't ever buy this vacuum again.

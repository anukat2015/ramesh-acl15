Title: Could not be happier
Content:
This is a VERY nice camera. The camera starts up instantly and takes the picture I want with no lag. While shooting sports, lag is always an issue, I have detected none.
The battery is excellent. I was a little apprehensive over the case being plastic. My old camera was an A2E and it was built like a tank. Then I started thinking how they build planes out of plastic, so that concern was negated (at least in my head, and I was going from a tank to plane) so I bought it. Now I love the light weight of this camera and it's no longer an issue "lugging" it around. If you just want to shoot decent shots keep the 18-55mm lens on it. It's a feather, but this is a starter lens. When you get more money you will at some time want to upgrade it, there should be no rush as it's a very capable lens and it has image stabilization. (Hey, who makes better glass than Canon?)
Now for my real only complaint. When I first started using this camera I noticed I was not using the setting I thought I was. When I was shutting off the camera my finger was rubbing against the exposure wheel and it was changing the setting. Since becoming aware if this I have had no more problems with it.
You will be very pleased if you purchase this camera.

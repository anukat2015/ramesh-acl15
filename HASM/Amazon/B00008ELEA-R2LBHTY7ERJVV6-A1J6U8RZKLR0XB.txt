Title: A Drip-to-Perk Convert!
Content:
When my drip coffee maker bit the dust a month ago, I started sifting through the various styles, makes, sizes, etc. and the customer reviews for a replacement.  
My kitchen is almost minuscule and I cook A LOT and counter space is at a real premium.  Most all the drip makers, of any capacity, are monsters in relation to the space I have to devote to coffee...But one of the reviews suggested that perk-coffee was better than drip (no paper filter to remove the lovely oils...makes perfect sense, NOW) and more economical since the perking process allows more time for the coffee and the water to be in contact...another no-brainer, right? Why not try, I thought; my mother used to make coffee in a percolator...
Good move:  Excellent coffee flavor and yes, I do use less of the expensive coffee I just love.  Easy to use, MUCH smaller on my counter top and keeps the coffee really, really hot (which pleases my man-friend to no end, 'cause he uses cream with his coffee.)
We are early risers, and I did initially miss the timer that is usually on the drip models.  But I have to say that after using this pot for almost a month, if I set it up before I go to bed, plug it in on my way to taking out the dog in the morning, I have a perfect, full, really hot pot of  coffee ready when I come back in (about eight minutes.)
Small enough to keep on the counter, attractive in a sort of retro-way, easy to clean, sturdy and economical.  Does it get too much better?
Truly excellent. Recommend it highly.

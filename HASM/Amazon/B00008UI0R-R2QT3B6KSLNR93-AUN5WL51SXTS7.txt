Title: Don't waste your time
Content:
We had this vacuum 3 months before the motor stopped working. Then we waited another 3 months for the part.  Then they finally gave us a new vacuum cleaner but not the same one. This model  the entire hose assembly broke off from the main canister and cannot be fixed.
Hoover just doesn't make vacuum cleaners like they use to.

Title: WHY, WHY, WHY??
Content:
do they make it impossible to find a new water filter for this coffee maker???
Even their OWN web site does not have one listed! I have asked two chain store managers that sell Cuisinart products to see it THEY could but one from the factory... NEITHER could!!
Soo... We are going to get rid of this coffee maker next week for a $2. dollar item!! (and not buying a new one from Cuisinart)
Quite Bizarre!

Title: Stay Away!!!
Content:
Initially when I purchased this a month back, it was heating up pretty good. The only problem I had was that the temperature difference between the heater turning off and on again was like 4 degrees. This created both cold and hot zones. 
After about 3 weeks, the automatic shut-off got activated and the heater stopped working. There is instruction on the cord that advices you to unplug the heater and wait for 10 mins before using it again. I followed it and it again started working. But after another week, everyday, the auto shut-off would kick-in within like 5 mins of switching on the heater. After that it was consistently just working only for 5 mins and then will automatically get reset after about several hours to only run for another 5 mins. It became so frustrating that I returned this back to Target.

Title: Fair, but buyer beware...
Content:
I bought this heater and am returning it because it does not output enough to really affect the temperature of my large room, however, that's not why I'm giving it two stars. I'm giving it two stars because of the inaccuracy of the photos and description, which I feel are mildly deceptive. First, the finish appears chrome in the picture whereas it is actually a flat gray metallic finish on the sides, with chrome feet, top and sides. Second, mine did not have a "vintage cloth cord", instead it had a rather un-vintage black plastic coated cord. It's still probably not a bad buy for heating small rooms, but be warned, if you have a large room, or are smitten with the idea of a "retro" heater, make sure you realize it's not going to look as depicted online.

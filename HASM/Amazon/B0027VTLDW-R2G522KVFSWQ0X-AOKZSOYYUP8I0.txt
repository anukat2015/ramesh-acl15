Title: Good Heater but it is thermostat-dependent
Content:
That Lasko 753450 looks good, it's not too big, and is pretty solid (construction-wise). My only problem with this heater is that it is thermostat-dependent. Meaning, if you want to just use the fan to cool a room, you won't be able to because lets say the room is 70 degrees and you set the thermostat to 65 degrees the heater thinks that you want to heat the room and the job is already done, so it shuts off. 
It does have a "max" temperature that will leave the heater running until you shut it off...I wish it had a "low" temperature to work the same way for cooling purposes. 
Another thing I do not like is how LOUD it beeps everytime you press a button. I wonder if there is a way to turn the noise off.

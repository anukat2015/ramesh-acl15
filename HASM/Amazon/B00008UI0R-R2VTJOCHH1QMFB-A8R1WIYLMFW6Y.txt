Title: This Vacuum Sucks!
Content:
For a vacuum, that is the ultimate praise.  I can't believe that I actually got excited about a vacuum, but this model is - for the price range - amazing!  
Pros:
Variable length on the handle part of the hose (makes it easier to make the kids help with vacuuming).  
Wide floor brush with fairly firm bristles.
Compact size canister fits nicely in small closet (in fact, had more trouble fitting the end piece, because it is pretty wide.
Nice little handle instead of just holding the hose.
Cons (and small "cons" they are):
1) floor attachment doesn't have a hole for the little button thing (you know, the little metal button that helps keep it attached).  I'm thinking of drilling one myself, since the hose has the metal button.
2) I can't figure out why it has 3 power levels and starts automatically on the lowest.  Like, who would even want to clean up less?  I always hit the button twice to ramp it up to full suction, as soon as I start it.
3) Bagless container thing seems a bit small. Pretty frequent dumping needed, but I guess that is the price paid for the size of the unit.
Well, I've only had it for a couple weeks, so once I break it in a bit more, I'll try to remember a follow up report.  I know this though, I'll never buy another Kenmore after trying out this baby.

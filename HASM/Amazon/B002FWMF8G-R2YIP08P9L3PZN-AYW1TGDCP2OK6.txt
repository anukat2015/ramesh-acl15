Title: Works with My New Year's Diet!
Content:
The Mr. Coffee café frappe maker is certainly a winner! As other reviewers have stated, it is very easy to have a delicious cold coffee drink that can rival the "big S guys," in the comfort of your own home, on demand, and as a savings for your wallet to boot! I have had no problem with the small spray that is ejected from the top of the blender container. But I have to say, even though I am waiting for the blender to turn on after the deliciously aromatic, dark brew is ready, the sudden loud whirling gets me to jump every time! 
When playing barista at home, I add a spoonful of Torani sugar free hazelnut, 1% milk, a touch of Splenda, and a dollop of low fat whipped cream with a tiny sprinkling of raw sugar on top for a perfect low cal treat. The only small negative I could state is the size of the appliance. The frappe maker will not fit under a traditional kitchen cabinet. I doubt if that could be changed for optimal performance, but if you are considering purchasing and all you have is counter space under the cabinets, this may be an issue. But if not, order it today!

Title: "Wow" says it all!
Content:
This is my first DSLR and I can say it will be the last for a long time. I've only had it for two weeks and I haven't even scratched the surface of all that it can do. The picture quality is awesome and the ease of use is even better. I've owned an SLR (Minolta) before but it didn't compare to the quality of this unit. The older Minolta even costed about the same as this unit and it couldn't even come close to the feature for value ratio of the Olympus Evolt E500.
This camera is beginner friendly and the manual supplied with it is easy to read and understandable. I can't wait to get aerial shots of Afghanistan. Exceptional clarity in any mode is an understatement. Buy one today and see what I mean. Enjoy!!!

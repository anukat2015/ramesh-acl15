Title: HP Laptop
Content:
So far, the laptop has performed beautifully.  It's loaded with Windows 7, and it's fast and slick.  If the machine continues to work this well, I will enthusiastically recommend HP to anyone I know.  The only drawback (and it's a very small thing) is that the glossy exterior shows prints with every single touch.

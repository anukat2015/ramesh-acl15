Title: amazing
Content:
Amazing player, definitely worth the money.
While it may not be listed, it does understand OGG/AAC music files (tagging support is not 100% yet, probably in a new firmware update).
Great to use with winamp, autosync/autofill makes things a breeze if you organize it as such.
Understands XVID!!
Beautiful screen, very easy interface.
No, HD to break.
Cons: As said before, OGG/ACC tags are not supported yet (at least transcoded in winamp), though this will probably be fixed in the future. Also, OGG is not understood as a file it can play by windows vista, so it will ask if you really want to transfer the file (just say yes to all and it works anyway). 
Winamp album art transfer is a bit buggy (probably winamp's fault, who knows).
Its a flash player, so you only get 8gb, more than enough if you properly encode your files though, 1 day 12 hours worth of music is less than 50% of the space (~128kbps VBR mp3's), though this is technically a positive if you run/work out with it.
Bottum Line: Get this player, not just because its an alternative to the ipod, but because its better than the ipod.

Title: I Actually Own One, unlike some tools posting
Content:
Picked up mine yesterday at 10 a.m. and, while it is a bit early to give a full review, this is thus far a great product. I was a bit concerned as I read the article about lighting (plagiarized in other posts here), as I am an avid biker - but clearly that was written by someone with an agenda. I had no problem seeing the screen while biking to and from work today. Why would MS show videos of it in low light? Duh, for the same reason I turn off the lights when I watch my flat screen.
I do, however, miss the squircle while biking as it allowed me to change volume and rewind by feel and without having to take my eyes off the road. Maybe I will get used to it but, for now, I have to wait for a red light to make adjustments as there are just to many "swipes" to get to volume control, Rew, FF and Pause.
If, like me, you had the Zune 80 the drop in storage capacity is also an issue. Now I have to pick and choose the movies I load as opposed to dumping them all on. Looking forward to larger capacities coming out in the future.
Finally, small issue, but not a big fan of the earbuds this time. Much prefer the ones that came with the 80 and 120 gig Zune.
Strictly a personal preference, but I liked the Zune 80 because it felt solid and wasn't effeminate like many other products. While those days are gone, the platinum still has a good solid feel to it.
I gave the drawbacks for me, but there is always room for improvement. I gave it 5 stars because all the other features are a joy to experience. Just give me more storage and easier access to volume controls.

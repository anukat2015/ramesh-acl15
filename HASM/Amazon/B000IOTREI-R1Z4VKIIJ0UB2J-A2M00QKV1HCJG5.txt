Title: Low Price Its Only Benefit
Content:
I have had two Presto Heatdishes for about two years, which I bought because they were the lowest-priced small space heater available at the time. The parabolic design focuses a lot of heat in a small area rather than less heat evenly distributed through a larger area, which means aiming the dish is a critical thing.
The biggest problem, which Presto's Customer Service has no solution for (based on my one conversation with them and reading about this on consumer bulletin boards) is that there is an extremely-loud "safety" buzzer that goes off whenever the dish is bumped, moved, knocked over or "gets too hot" (in the words of the Customer Service people). None of the former is an issue except getting too hot. The thermostat or whatever other part of the circuitry that "decides" that the heater is getting too hot wears out or degrades after a few months and sets off the buzzer intermittently or continuously. Other than "cleaning the dish," Presto's Customer Service could offer no solution nor were they planning on addressing the problem. No re-wiring solutions were available and Presto does not intend to make one available.
I took the heater apart and it appears to me that there could be a way to disconnect or bypass the buzzer, but it's just a little beyond my rudimentary wiring skills. My heater works fine until the buzzer goes off, at which point I turn it off and wait until it cools down before turning it on again.
If you can live with this, it probably is a reasonably-good (if limited because of the highly-foucused heat pattern) heater. But please keep this in mind when thinking about buying one.

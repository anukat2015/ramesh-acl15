Title: Coffee snob gives 2 thumbs up!
Content:
This is one of a very small number of coffee makers that has the ability to brew a "perfect" cup.
1. water in the Brew N Go's brew basket measures a consistent 200 F which is the required brew temp according to SCCA. Only the $300 Technivorm coffee maker can match that temperature. All other machines brew aroung 175-185 F making a weak lifeless cup.
2. The brew basket is cone shaped which best allows all the grounds to brew evenly. I suggest removing the peremanent filter and using melitta paper #2 filters instead for better brew times and easier extraction. This also leaves more room for the grounds to "bloom."
3. Did I mention this actually brews at 200 F. If you seek a perfect cup of joe...buy this machine or stick with a melitta pur over or french press to ensure a proper temperature

Title: Running too hot to handle
Content:
This was ordered for me and sent to Barbados as a gift, this media player did not last as long as a snow-cone in my sunny island...it is running extremely hot in a matter of 15mns and there is no sound. It is too hot to hold in your hand and the headphones are also getting hot.  I am going to send it back!
Not happy at all with this product!!!!!
I just got a friend to order me a mobile Nokia E63 I just hope that I do not get any problems with it.

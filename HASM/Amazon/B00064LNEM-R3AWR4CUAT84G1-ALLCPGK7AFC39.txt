Title: coffe just O.K.
Content:
I purchased this coffee machine last week at Target (cheapest there) after staying up forever trying to decide which coffee maker to get. There are lots of things I like about this one-- looks nice, auto shut off, coffee pot opening large so it's easy to clean, coffee is hot enough, and coffee pot did not drip when pouring.  For all of these reasons, I was very excited, BUT... the coffee was weak!! The most important thing about a coffee maker should be the taste of the coffee, and in my experience, this coffee maker makes very weak coffee. Of course, I tried adding more grinds (MUCH more), but each time the coffee came out the same. So, despite it's good points, I've decided that I can't live with that. I'm returning it and searching for a different one.

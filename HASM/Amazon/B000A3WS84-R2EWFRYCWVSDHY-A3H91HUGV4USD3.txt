Title: Excellent
Content:
We bought the 30 GB version and we love it.
- The screen is small but clear and sharp. Go to an Apple store and see it first to make sure you're cool with it.
- The audio is excellent.
- It is very stylish. The 30 GB version is thin and convenient and holds a lot.
- It is very easy to use. iTunes is a breeze to use (we have a PC).
- Chinese characters show up just fine in the iPod text.
- We bought QuickTime Pro ($30) because it was the most convenient software I found for converting video to the iPod format. Videora Converter is free and useful for getting video into the H264 format, but I found I needed QuickTime Pro to get it to the final correct iPod format. The final conversion is very, very slow.
- It comes with a reasonable case, but I'm hoping for an after-market case to hold it and the headphones. Ideally there would be one that would protect the screen and let you view it clearly. In general, we're just very careful.
- It comes with a cable to hook to USB 2.0. Early USB version apparently may not supply enough power to recharge the iPod.
- The Lithium Ion battery charges up to 80% really quickly (less than 3 hours from dead zero), and then trickle charges to 100%. The battery may be recharged at any time w/o risk of "memory" like a Nickel Cadmium battery.
- Playing music, a full battery is supposed to last about 14 hours. Playing video it lasts a lot less. I would estimate about 3 to 4 hours on a full charge.
- Replacing the battery currently means sending the entire iPod back to Apple and getting a new/refurbished one. See the Apple web site for details.
- I saw a review about it hanging on the language selection screen right out of the box. Ours did, too, but I just followed the instructions on resetting it. No problems since.

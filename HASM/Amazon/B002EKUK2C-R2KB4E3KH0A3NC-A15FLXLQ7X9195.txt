Title: Not As Advertised
Content:
SO this unit works very well if no hotter than 82 degrees outside.   If its hotter than 82 degrees the unit will only spit out 63 degree air.  Which cools a little bit but does not make the cold by any means.  I'm lucky if I can hold 73 degrees average room temp with another fan blowing.  I have a instant read thermometer I used to test the unit.  I have had it for about 2 months now.   My office is about 210sq ft and in a basement (no direct sunlight).  They advertise that this is a 12k BTU unit (its not) and that it can cool up to a 425sq ft room.  It can't.    
In dehumidifier basically dose not work until you install a condensation pump.  The unit is advertised as "exhausts most or all condensate automatically except under extreme humidity situations"  This is the case when the A/C is on but not the dehumidifier.  I don't have a damp or wet basement by any means, however while in dehumidifier mode the condensation just does not exhaust like in A/C mode.  Without the condensation pump, the unit will shut off after about an hour because "internal reservoir"  is full.  The reservoir holds about 20 ounces, and you need to go to the back of the unit to drain it.  This is messy to do, due to the drain being right at floor level. 
The unit itself was cheap compared to brand name, I paid $380 with free shipping.  However now today was an exceptionally hot day and my unit isn't really cooling, i would have rather spend the extra $300 and purchased a brand name unit that works the way a typically AC would.

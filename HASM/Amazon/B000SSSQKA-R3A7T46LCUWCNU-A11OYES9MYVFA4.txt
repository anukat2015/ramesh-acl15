Title: Lightweight
Content:
I purchased this after reading the Amazon reviews.  Here are the pros & cons I found:
Pro:  Love the telescoping wand!
   Suction knob to vary from min-max
   also a flow control at the top of the wand.
   lightweight, easy to tote upstairs or out to the car
   wand works on upholstered furniture - sofa cleaning made easy!
   max suction works great to get the crud out of the cracks in hardwood floors
Cons:  terrible to push on carpet with a strong nap.
               I have cheap synthetic area rugs.
    the brush attachment is kinda wimpy
    would like to have a longer cord, but this reaches the entire room.

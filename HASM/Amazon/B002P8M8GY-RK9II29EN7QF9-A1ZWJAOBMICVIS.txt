Title: Good but some negatives
Content:
THE GOOD: is functions pretty well ,and is very fast with 4 gig memory and dual core processor.
THE BAD : The finish on the inside and out is way too glossy...just like glass...it shows every fingerprint..and need to wipe it down after every use..or it looks really dirty.
It is really heavy..if placed on lap..it would cut off circulation..wish I checked it out in store first..because it weighs a ton.
Cant get BlueTooth option to work with my Bluetooth Keyboard or my other BlueTooth enabled PC.
Called Tech support..got a guy in India who was worthless...could hardly understand or hear him ..very bad phone connection.
Given the glossy surface and heavy weight would not recommend it as a laptop.
Consumer reports did recommend alot of Toshiba laptops as being more reliable then Dell, HP etc.

Title: Love this product
Content:
I am really enjoying this product.  I use it for simple cups of hot water for tea as well as a good cup of gourmet coffee.  I find that the largest cup is too strong for my taste therefore I run it thru the large then reset it to run thru the small (thru the same k-cup) to create a larger cup of coffee.  That's perfect strength and flavor.  Also, to save money, I've purchased the My K-Cup reusable coffee filter and it works GREAT and I am not forced to spend a ton of money on their expensive k-cups.
Great investment!!!

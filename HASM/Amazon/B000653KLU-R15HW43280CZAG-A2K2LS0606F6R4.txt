Title: Cheaper then the same Delonghi's 6707E NOW!
Content:
Previous post on the price is outdated now. Its actually $20 cheaper then the Delonghi's 6707E. Ended up getting this oil-filled radiator at my favorite Home Improvement Store (w/ Orange Logo) for $59. Considering the steep rise in fuel prices this winter, I wanted to augment my force-air heater with an efficient electric radiator heater. I own another one of these but a much older model which we use in our bedroom. Its great in keeping the room relative warm and toasty when we sleep. We needed another one for our living room where we spend most of our time around the house. We choose this model because it automatically modulates the heat based on the temperature setting. At the same time, the timer will be handy because we will only need to set it on for a portion of the day. At the same time, since we have a baby crawling around, we were concerned about the temperature of the unit. It turns out that it was relative cool to the touch compared to older units. All in all, this is one of the better oil-filled radiator out there in quality and features for $59. Had to take one star off because the LCD was little difficult to read unless you look at it straight on at the same level.

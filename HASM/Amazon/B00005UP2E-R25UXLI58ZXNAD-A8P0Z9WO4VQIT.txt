Title: 2 things I liked better about my 1998 model
Content:
This Dirt Devil picks up better than the one I bought in 1998, but the longer cord on the 1998 model made it easier for me to clean parts of my home.   Also, since I have allergies, having to dump the dirt out and bang the Hepa filter on the side of the garbage can is a problem.   It was healthier for me, with the 1998 model, to put the disposable bag into the trash.  Environmentally, the new one makes less trash, which I do like.

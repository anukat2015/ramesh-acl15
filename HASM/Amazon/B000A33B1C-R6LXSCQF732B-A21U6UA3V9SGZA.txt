Title: Mike's Review
Content:
Just opened this unit, read the directions, plugged-it-in and have enjoyed the quiet heat of this oil-filled radiator heater for the last several nights. We have bought several portable heaters over the years and always get this type because they are quiet (no annoying fans). Usually, every two-three years they have to be replaced due to oil leaking or a cord connection going bad. Our last heater had a digital temperature readout, which I really liked - where this one does not (the reason for a 4-star rating instead of 5). The timer is easy to set - little "flimsy feeling" plastic tabs set in - for heater on, and out - for heater off.  One nice feature is the metal plates along the sides which seem to channel heat upwards through top vents keeping the sides cooler (a concern if little children are present).

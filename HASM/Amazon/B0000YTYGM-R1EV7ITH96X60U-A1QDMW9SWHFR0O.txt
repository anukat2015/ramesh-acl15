Title: Works for me!
Content:
I have had this cuisinart coffee maker for almost 2 years - and other than the fact that it doesn't keep the coffee scalding hot, I have NO COMPLAINTS.  It has never run all over the counter, spewed grinds and water or coffee all over the place, or done ANY of the crazy things others have reported here.  WHen it gets near the bottom, I do have to upend it to get the remaining coffee out, but I usually just take the top off and pour, and then set the carafe in the sink to rinse.  NO BIGGIE.
It holds more than enough coffee, it makes fabulous coffee and gives me that "Ahhhhh" experience from the very first drop.  Like I said, a couple hours after brewing, it isn't piping hot - well, it is NEVER piping hot - but it is plenty hot for me.

Title: Please do not buy from this seller!
Content:
I purchased a heater from this seller and received it.  It did not work and I called and was told to send it back.  I printed off a return ticket for Fed Express from my computer and sent it back indicating on the form provided that I wanted a refund.
I received a message via email stating that my package was mailed.  I responded stating that I wanted a refund.  I received the heater again and it was the same or identical non-functioning heater that I received before.  I called and spoke to a representative and was told that I needed to return the same damaged heater again.  I refused because the process takes a long time and I have to take time off from work to get to the Fed Ex office to return it.
Needless to say, I am vey disappointed in my choice of vendors for this product and would not recommend them to anyone!  This is the first bad experience I have had with all of my purchases through Amazon.

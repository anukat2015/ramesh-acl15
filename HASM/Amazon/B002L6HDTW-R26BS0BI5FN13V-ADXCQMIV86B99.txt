Title: Sorry ipod fans, but I am NOT impressed
Content:
My biggest complaint is battery life.  What kind of battery life you can expect from your ipod seems to be luck-of-the-draw.  Some are good and some are not so good. I have my device set up to conserve battery life as much as possible and I only get about five hours of play.  If the battery is fully charged and then left unused, it is almost completely dead within a week or two.  I guess what really irks me the most is that this has been a common complaint with the ipod nanos for a long time and Apple has done nothing to remedy the problem.  If you look at reviews from earlier models, you will see a LOT of people complaing about battery life.
If you are not familiar with this style of ipod, be warned that they are quite fragile; drop it once on a hard surface and you can bet that it is going to break.  I also do not like the fact that Apple seems to be trying to force people into using itunes (which really bites).  It is one of the poorest reviewed music managing programs.  The Nano does have some positive features, which you can read about from other reviewers, but I just find the battery life unexceptable.  I am going to see if Apple will replace the battery via warranty.  If so, I will probably switch to a 4-star review.

Title: sexy sansa
Content:
I read some reviews of refurb sandisks a couple days after i got mine and became a bit worried...but...my mp3 player is attached to my ear or car at almost all times. It is playing an average of like 17 hours a day. As i type this, my sansa is rockin' away. It has briefly frozen up twice, but was no problem. I pushed the power button and it turned off and came right back on with no problem. I love my refurb and would recommend this product to any and everyone. rockin on random all day long.       thank u guys so much...

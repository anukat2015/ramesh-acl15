Title: Worth the wait
Content:
Switched to this product from a Bunn. I gave up some speed but the coffee quality is fantastic. The coffee grind basked included works best if you just drop it in from a few inches above the slot. It keeps the coffee at perfect temperature without changing the taste even after a couple of hours.

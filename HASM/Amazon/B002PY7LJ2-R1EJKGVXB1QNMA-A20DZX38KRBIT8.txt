Title: Netbooks suck
Content:
The idea of smaller laptops doesn't make much sense when you are sacrificing all the speed, screen size, display quality, hard drive space, hardware quality, dvd/cd rom drive, wireless speed that makes up a good notebook.  Netbooks are smaller....ok but they are not better at anything and are worse at 90% of things.  This laptop, Acer's, toshiba's, and HP's mini laptops are all made with the same cheap, slow, low quality hardware, dull displays, horrid screen resolutions and terrible processors in a smaller box.  Waste of money.

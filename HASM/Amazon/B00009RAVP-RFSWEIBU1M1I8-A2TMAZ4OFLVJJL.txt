Title: Instant Heat
Content:
We had a holmes radiant heater some years ago. After it stopped working we went without for a couple of years.  We seen this and gave it a try.  Wonderful replacement for our old heater.  Heats our living room about 15x15 in a few minutes.  Puts out instant heat when turned on, great to stand in front of.
Works great with our substandard wiring, many of the other fan heaters would blow our fuse box, this here works on less watts and better output of heat.

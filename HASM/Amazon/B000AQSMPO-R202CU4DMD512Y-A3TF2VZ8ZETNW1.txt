Title: keurig coffee maker
Content:
It took me a couple of times to figure out how I liked my coffee. I had three choices. I like it on the largest selections.  The coffee tastes different. Not a bad different, just different. With the 
"bolder" coffees, I use some creamer. 
I bought a K-cup modifier, it lets you use your own coffee. The k-cups aren't cheap, but it's like "if you can afford an SUV - you can afford the gas you put in it."
I found an interent provider that has very good prices on the k-cups. You have your choice of joining their "club" or not.  Their prices are at least 1/2 of what I've seen at other vendors, on the net.

I would recommend it to a friend.

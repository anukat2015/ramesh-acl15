Title: Item not as discribed
Content:
The item I received was not as described in the web page.  I expected to receive with the Shark 15.6v Hand Vac the charging stand and also the utility brush as pictured on the page the Hand Vac with advertised on.  In the future state that the accessaries pictured are not being sold with the item advertised but are a seperate purchase from the Shark Company.  It came with the motorized brush and crevice tool but not the charging stand and utility brush. Which is $3.95/item plus s/h from the Shark Company.

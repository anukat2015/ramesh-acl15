Title: This is a great product!
Content:
This thermostat is extremely easy to use. The instructions on how to program and install are lengthy yet clear. We really like to look at the end of the day and see how much less the unit runs during the work week verses when we are at home on it's energy tracking feature. If you load the default settings and then customize them from there it is great!

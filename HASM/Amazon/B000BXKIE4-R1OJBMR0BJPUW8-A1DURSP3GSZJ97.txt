Title: Disappointed With Carpet Performance
Content:
We have owned the vacuum for a few months now.  We liked the positive reviews on allergen control and low noise performance of this model.  If you're looking for a unit for light use, especially for use on floors the rating would be higher than given here; but we really needed a vacuum that could handle carpets.  This unit is not at all acceptable for use on carpets.  The head does not adjust to carpets well and it takes a lot of work to vacuum carpet.  The power head is rather small too, which means it takes longer to cover a larger area.  I really wish that others had provided this information when we were shopping, in hindsight we paid a lot of money for a vacuum which performs so poorly on carpets.  Our recommendation to anyone who is considering this model is to go see one in person and try it out on the types of surfaces you will be cleaning.

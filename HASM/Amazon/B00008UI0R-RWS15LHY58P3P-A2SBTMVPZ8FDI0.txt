Title: It should have been a "5 STAR" review.
Content:
The product worked great right out of the box.  It more than lived up to other positive reviews.
Then on the day I get a request from Amazon to write a review, it let me down!
This was maybe the 3rd time it was being used when the belt in the power head came of the motor.  
It is fairly easy to put it back on.  But now it  comes off most every time it is used.
I'm at a loss. There doesn't seem to be a fix for this in the Owner's Manuel.
I'm trying to contact the manufacturer to see what can be done.

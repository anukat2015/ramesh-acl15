Title: Overflows and floods at least once a month
Content:
Here is a letter I mailed to the company:
"This is the second time I have written.  I will not be writing again but the problem has escalated to the point where the coffee maker no longer functions.  Needless to say, I will never buy your product again.  I wrote earlier to complain of the design flaw that causes the coffee maker to overflow.  I understand that the flow through lid on the thermal carafe is getting clogged with grounds and that then the pause and serve valve is getting clogged and the maker keeps making.  No kidding.  But why do I have to treat a $150 dollar coffee maker like surgical equipment? All I do is grind my coffee, put it in the basket filter and push the button.  I clean the top and basket regularly.  I run hot water through with vinegar to keep it from scaling.  I angst about whether this time or that the coffee was ground too fine and it's all my fault.  This is too much stress for first thing in the morning.  And, no, I can't use the timer in order to encounter the stress before bed, because then I awake wondering whether there is coffee all over the counter, which frequently there is.  So at this point the last flood effectively has destroyed the coffee maker's electronics.  I can't set the clock, the lights are dim.  It's a hazard.  I am going to purchase a new coffee maker today and it won't be yours.  I really really really wanted to like this maker.  I have had it for three years.  But that's $50 dollars a year.  Does that seem in any way fair?  I will be posting this on all the web review sites, fyi."

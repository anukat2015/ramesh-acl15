Title: great item
Content:
This is a great little ipod.  Does everything I want it to do.  I love the slim design of it.  The only drawback I have had is finding a docking station that is compatible with it.  Most are designed for everything up to the 3rd generation nano.  I don't have any complaints about the nano itself; it's a great little gadget.

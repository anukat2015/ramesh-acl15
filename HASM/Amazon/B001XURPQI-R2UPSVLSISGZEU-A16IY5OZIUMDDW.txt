Title: Much better than my XTi
Content:
This camera performs much better than my Canon Rebel XTi, which I upgraded from.  Image quality is better, buttons are laid out more intuitively, and the LCD screen is amazing.  I have had the camera for a month, and I have been very happy with the pictures and movies I have taken.

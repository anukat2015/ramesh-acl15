Title: worst vacuum ever
Content:
The head of this vacuume is way too big. This vacuume is extremely heavy, it's hard to clean the "filterless filter" which is required often, and most diaspointing of all, it has very poor suction power. It worked well for about 3 weeks of daily use, and then it just lost it. IT is also very time consuming and difficult to take the bottom part off when it's time to change the belt. Purchase one of the 99$ hoovers instead of this, i've had much better experience with those.
Oh, not to mention, it's impossible to find replacement belts for this.

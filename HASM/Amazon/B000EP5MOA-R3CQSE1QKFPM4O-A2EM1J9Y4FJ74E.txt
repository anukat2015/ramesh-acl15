Title: Apple 8 GB IPod Nano Black (2nd generation)
Content:
Excellent quality and ease of use. Friendly software. My wife and I listen to audio books. It would be better if the rewind/fast forward speeds were progressive -- slow at first then speeding up so you could go quickly to any point in the book. Otherwise, no complaints. The leather case we bought is perfect.

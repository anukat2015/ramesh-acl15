Title: Pay Me Now or Pay Me Later
Content:
I had high hopes when purchasing Shark Roadster at Super Target. By the time I finished vacuuming the house the first time, those hopes had disappeared.  
  
 Suction is OK, but the entire unit is quite awkward. The hose is not quite long enough to allow you that extra reach without dragging the unit. And YES, it does like to overheat.  
  
 Let's not forget the higly promoted HEPA Filter. Be sure to clean it after each use, or you will set the house on fire.  
  
 Another surprise occurred when I tried to locate a replacement filter. Target has yet to carry them, so I tried the Euro-Pro web site, where they do not appear, either. An email to customer service was finally answered, indicating that they are available by mail. Sorry, I am not going to take out a home equity loan to purchase one.  
  
 The vacuum now resides in the back corner of the basement closet, as it has long since been replaced. Suffice to say that I am extremely displeased with Euro-Pro for producing such a piece of junk, and their $$$$ minded form of customer support. I am a faithful Target customer, and am just a little sore at them also, for failing to stock the filters.

Title: Great product but could use a few tweeks
Content:
I bought this space heater for my bedroom, which is relatively small. It is great at it's job. It definitely gets my room warm and keeps it that way. The only two things I would change about it are !) It should have a digital thermostat so you can set a specific temperature instead of the guessing game of the dial setting and 2) It should cycle on and off even when on a high setting. When it is on a high setting it will stay on and spew out hot air all night. You'll wake up with cotton mouth if you don't set it low enough so it'll cycle on and off but high enough that it will stay warm. All in all I give it a 8 out of 10 stars.

Title: Great Fire in my Fireplace
Content:
I mounted an LCD Television over my fireplace and resolved never to have a fire in the fireplace. We started missing seeing a fire there, so I started looking for a fake fire. All of the items I looked at fell short of realitiy except for this product. We all enjoy seeing the warm glowing fire and dancing flames. We do not use the heater as I do not want to over load the outlet. The only drawback is the mirror like back that tends ro reflect  light. But that is overcome by not having lights on when we are using it. This is a great, well built product that gives any room a warm appeal.

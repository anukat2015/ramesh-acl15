Title: Best vacuum out there
Content:
Wow!!! I had to try it out even though I had just vacuumed.  It was amazing how much dust/dirt showed up in the canister - extremely powerful on high suction.  I wanted something strong enough I had to worry about sucking up the dog with the dog hair and I got it.
Canister is lightweight and moves easily on all surfaces and around corners (great for those with bad backs), long poles for less reaching, quiet. Easy to use features such as suction control (with bright red, easy to see indicator), carpet to hardwood button, easy tab for removing poles to swap for attachments, canister easy to remove, a little hassle to wash out.  Probably can't vac a whole house without changing canister, but well worth not having to buy the expensive bags.

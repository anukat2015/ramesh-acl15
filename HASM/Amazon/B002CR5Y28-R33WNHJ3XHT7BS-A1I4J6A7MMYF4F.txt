Title: Best vacuum I've owned
Content:
I have owned and thrown out so many vacuums over the last 20 years. This vacuum is worth every penny. First of all it is tiny and adorable (cute little retro blue). Secondly it WORKS and it's QUIET. The adjustable power is terrific. I've tried everything, commercial, bagless, upright, mini, cordless. This is all anyone could need. I have two dogs, an old dust manufacturing oil burner heating system, large house and teenage boy sneakers. It picks up all of it, quietly, easily and beautifully. Yes, I love my vacuum!

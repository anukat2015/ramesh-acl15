Title: Good little heater--seems to be efficient.
Content:
For some reason the fan stopped working for a few days and I was about to throw it out. Then the fan started working again. No problems since or otherwise. I use it to heat a large bedroom connected to an office and heats both rooms with no problem. Very quiet. I wish there was a way to use the heater without the simulated fire (which is surprisingly realistic and comforting), but, hey, it is what it is.

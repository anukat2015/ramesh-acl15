Title: AMAZING and CHEAP
Content:
This thing rocks! My girlfriend and I bought one for her crappy apt last year because I was freezing, and it heats up fast, does not smell like anything is burning, and can turn itself off with the convenient temp setting! This year, we have our own crappy apt, and it's still goin' strong! I love this thing! And it's kitten-proof! And no hike in our electric bill!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE ON A BUDGET!

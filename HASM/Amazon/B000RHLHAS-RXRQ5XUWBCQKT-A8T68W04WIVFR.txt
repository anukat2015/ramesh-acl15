Title: Perfect for 3 Years
Content:
I have owned several space heaters, but this HZ-341 has been great for 3 years.  Instant heat, doesn't take up much space, and easy to direct the heat where you need it.  I like it so well I'm buying a second unit to use in my basement office.
Excellent value!

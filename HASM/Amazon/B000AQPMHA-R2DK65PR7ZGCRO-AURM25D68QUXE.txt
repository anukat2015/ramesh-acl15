Title: love it
Content:
My family and I are thoroughly enjoying the versatility and ease of this product. Everyone, including the children, can select their favorite hot drinks ranging from  hot chocolate, to herbal teas, flavored coffees, and bold java jolts. No more pots and filters to clean. No pouring out left over coffee. No more arguing - decaf or rocket fuel? Flavored or not? I don't know why it has to make such a loud noise when the water is heating, though. It's a bit annoying. And sometimes the water output is inconsistent, filling the mug at differing quantities. Overall, we're happy with this product.

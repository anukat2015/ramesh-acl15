Title: Expensive, but worth it
Content:
This is the best coffee maker I've ever had. The coffee comes out piping hot; hot enough even if you don't warm the carafe first. It brews great coffee fast and looks nice. Excellent quality. If there is anything I don't like about it, it's that the filter indicator light is always on, which takes getting used to (you may think the unit is turned on, but it's not), but no big deal. And the stainless heating element is a smart idea, not just to eliminate decalcification, but who wants to drink water that's been boiled through aluminum when aluminum is suspected of causing Alzheimer's Disease?

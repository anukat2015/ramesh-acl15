Title: NEVER AGAIN!!
Content:
I bought this vacuum as a replacement for my Kirby.  I could not have made a bigger mistake in my purchase!  The hose gets clogged FREQUENTLY and renders itself absolutely WORTHLESS.  The canister fills up QUICKLY. The cord is a mess and does not fit anywhere.  I am VERY disappointed in this Eureka.  I consider this purchase of the Eureka Uno one of my worst purchases.

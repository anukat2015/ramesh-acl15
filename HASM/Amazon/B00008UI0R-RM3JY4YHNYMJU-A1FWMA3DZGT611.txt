Title: Hoover s3765-040 Wind Tunnel
Content:
Have had the cleaner for a month now and it does what it should, quite well.  
The size of the cleaning head is a bit larger and heavier than I need/would like.  
It's a little too loud also.
We mostly have hardwood floors and although the vacuum cleans them well, it's really kind of difficult to tell if it's working or not.
All in all I would have looked for a lighter vacuum, but am happy with this purchase.

Title: Good machine, small and costly to operate
Content:
We are serious about our coffee and this machine makes good coffee.  It also looks nicer than any other coffee maker we've seen.  We were surprised that the machine makes about 1/3 less coffee than other 10 cup coffee makers.  For this coffee maker, a cup of coffee is 4 ounces.  It also requires about 1/3 more coffee grounds to make the same strength coffee as other coffee makers.  It requires 1 tablespoon of finely ground coffee to make each 4 ounces of strong brewed coffee.  That said, it does make good coffee and seems well made compared to other machines we have tried.  Our experience is that none of these machines are really finely crafted machines.  Next time we will try a different brand that makes more coffee with less coffee grounds and might be less expensive.

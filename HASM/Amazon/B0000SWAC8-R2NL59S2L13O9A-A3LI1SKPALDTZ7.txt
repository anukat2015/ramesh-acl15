Title: A well-designed vacuum
Content:
Previously we had a Sears Kenmore canister vacuum. It worked well but was heavy and loud; also the power head died after 6 six years.  We bought the Electrolux 6988D because the price was comparable to an upper Kenmore and this Electrolux model was top-rated by Consumer Reports.  We are very satisfied with the Electrolux canister- it is considerably smaller and quieter than the Kenmore and the performance is excellent on both carpet and hardwood floors.  The beater bar has a lot of power on our berber carpet.  Everything is well thought out in the design.  Some may object to not having all the tools on board the canister, but by not having storage for the hard floor and furniture tools, the overall package that you have to move around is much more manuverable than our Kenmore (which stored all tools). There is a clip on the handle for the more frequently used tools - dust brush and crevice tool. An an industrial hygienist I can testify the filtration system is really excellent. It has a true HEPA filter which is easy to access, inspect and change. The bags are also well designed in that there is a sliding cover to eliminate the explosion of dust that usually happens when a canister bag is removed.  We've only had it about a month, but so far very pleased with the design, performance, and quality of construction.

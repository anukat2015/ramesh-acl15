Title: Not everybody's buddy
Content:
Most of the nice things folks say about this unit are true.  There are a couple nits: if you use the 12' hose you must introduce the gas verrrryyyy sloowwwwwllllyyyy or it trips a pressure switch and you'll have trouble getting it fired up.  
The biggest nit from my perspective: good luck using the thing over about 5000' elevation.  The oxygen safety sensor, while well intentioned, is so sensitive that the unit shuts itself off.  Once it does that, good luck getting it re-started or to stay lit even if you thoroughly vent the enclosure or take it outside.  Very annoying.  
So, if you are a sea level camper it's probably dandy, if you are a mountains and high desert camper, probably want to look elsewhere.

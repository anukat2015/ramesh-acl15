Title: Great player for the price!
Content:
I brought this mp3 player after my old one broke (a Sony that was 5 years old).  I went to Walmart to look for a cheap mp3 player and this was on sale.  
Pros:
Long battery life (compared to my old Sony)
Easy loading onto (and off) from computer
Easy controls
FM Radio
Little screen (I didn't have a screen before)
Cons: 
Flimsy outer covering
The Rapsidy thing
Overall this is a great mp3 player.  I take it everywhere from my vet job to retail job to school.  This mp3 player hasn't let me down, except for the factory ear buds, but thats to be expected.  I haven't had many mp3 players, but I wouldn't mind a larger memory one for Christmas.

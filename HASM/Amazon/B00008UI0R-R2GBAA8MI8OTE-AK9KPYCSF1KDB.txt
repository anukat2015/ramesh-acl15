Title: Pleased
Content:
We are very please with the new vacuum.  We visited several stores to get the feel of the various products, i.e. uprights, canister, etc.  After using it for a couple of weeks or so, we are pleased with our selection.  The only small inconvenience is that the canister is fairly small.  We have two cats and a long haired dog which doesn't help.  Given our limited experience, we would recommend this product.

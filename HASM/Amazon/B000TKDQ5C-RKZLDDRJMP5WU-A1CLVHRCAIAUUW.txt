Title: Great and Affordable
Content:
This little heater aids my small studio/garage (16'X18') room. I have a heater already but it wasn't keeping me warm enough this winter so I bought this a few days ago and now it gets hot in here at times (I'm still learning to play with the controls to find the best temperature) it an affordable heater that does the job. I don't know if it would heat my entire space by itself right now I keep it on half power and it kicks on every 5-10 minutes to control the room temperature, I guess if I turned the power up to full I could just use this one heater and unplug my other. I would recommend this heater to anyone with a small room.

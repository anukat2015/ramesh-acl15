Title: I've had two -- They are awful
Content:
I've had two of these things and they both leaked like crazy.  The first one just stopped working after a year and a couple months.  My wife bought another one in a rush for a party, and it started leaking within a month of buying it.  
Definitely choose another coffee maker.

Title: Excellent Except for>>>>
Content:
We love this coffee maker. It makes VERY HOT coffee which we have found not to be the case with most of drip type coffee makers. It brews delicious coffee as well. The only thing that I would improve is the ability to fill with water before brewing. The space is designed in a way that it is near impossible not to spill some water when filling. There just isnt enough space to pour. Otherwise its a great product.

Title: A great product !
Content:
I am so in love with this thing!  After bad experiences with Sandisk and iriver players, I finally wised up.  I am kicking myself for ever wasting time and money on anything else.  The interface is so elegant and intuitive it puts the others to shame.  I can do anything I need to do without even looking at the player.  
The sound is excellent of course, but I am not getting near the 14-hour battery life advertised.  That may be more because of the way I use it, though.  It's still plenty adequate.  I bought an after-market AC charger for about $6 that seems to work just as well as the $30 charger Apple should have included.  One of the best products I have ever purchased!

Title: Great little sucker for hardwood floors
Content:
I have two active German Shepherds and the hair and dirt that accumulates around here sometimes is crazy. It just became too much for my old expensive upright. One thing my old upright was never great at was the hardwood floors, which makes up three quarters of my house.  This little sucker does not have that problem.  It is powerful and fabulous on the hardwoods, getting the hair and dirt with ease and as it is lightweight and mobile I can get through the whole house in a reasonably short period of time.  The reason I didn't go with five stars is that without a full sized rotating brush head it is not good on carpeting.  The small pet attachment is good for upholstery and maybe small rugs, but not for full carpeting and larger rugs.  It would take forever to do one carpeted room going a few inches at a time.  Also, the dog hair can really get ground in to the rugs and I need that large brush to loosen it up.  I am now researching whether Eureka sells a full sized brush head for this little guy that I can purchase.  It would be really helpful.  Meanwhile, this is a great little vacuum for most of my house and given how inexpensive it was, I am really happy with it.

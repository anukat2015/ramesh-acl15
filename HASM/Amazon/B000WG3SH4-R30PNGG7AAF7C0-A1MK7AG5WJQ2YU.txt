Title: Broken after 8 months of light use!
Content:
I'm terribly disappointed that after 8 months of very, very light use, this Zune 8GB model which I bought from Amazon in May of 2008 is very dysfunctional, and no warranty covers it.
I liked the basic operation of the unit, but seldom used it and had it for those times I needed a portable player.  I'm sure I used it for less than 25 hours of playtime. The battery life was very poor, but I chalked that up to not using it very often.  Now, despite charging it fully every night it starts to run out after only a couple of hours, whether or not it's in use.  The big problem is the back button stopped working at all.  This is especially frustrating because it makes it difficult to do most things, including (a) turn it fully off to conserve the meager battery life, (b) reset and restore all the software.  
Apparently this only had a 7 month warranty, and while I looked into sending it into Microsoft to repair, that would cost $130!  And it costs less than that for a new one.  I'm not going to spend more than it costs to fix it, but of course I'm not going to buy another one either.
Given this frustration with a product that wasn't that cheap, I think I'm going to stick with the cheapest Sansa players I can find and consider them disposable before I spend another $150 on an Ipod or another brand.
The sound is nice, the style and function other than that discussed above is all good, but the more or less complete failure of a new product leaves me with only 1 star to give.

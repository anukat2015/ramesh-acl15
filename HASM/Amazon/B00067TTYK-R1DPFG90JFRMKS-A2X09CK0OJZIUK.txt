Title: it was nice, and then it wasn't
Content:
after about a month it started freezing regularly when I tried to turn it off. The only way to unfreeze the thing was to take the battery out.
Then, about a week later, it just completely froze, and the screen showed a picture of an unhappy zen micro...
Well, obviously this wasn't normal, so I called Creative and they said normally they would replace it, but they discontinued the product. Oh well, I did get my money back, and the customer service was good, so 4 stars.
I really liked it, and I would recommend it, I just hope it doesn't break.

Title: Fell apart right out the box
Content:
I took the vacuum out the box and undid the clips that hold the cover to the filter in place.  One of the posts that the clips hold on to fell right off making it impossible to re-secure the cover.  I didn't even get to switch it on!
Not a great recommendation for American workmanship.

Title: does not keep coffee hot at all!!!
Content:
I previously owned a cuisinart 14 cup machine....loved the way it made the coffee taste (perhaps the gold filter?); went to replace that machine after 1 1/2 years .....So, because I always wanted a thermal coffee pot, I bought this machine. Brewed my first pot a couple of days before Christmas and was sooooo disappointed that it did not keep my coffee hot at all....this machine brews coffee that is just warm or barely hot. Therefore, after the coffee is brewed, I have to put each cup in the microwave to get it hot enough to drink. This is a drag when you have a party or dinner and are serving coffee to a group of people!!! Also, the taste of the coffee is not as good as my previously owned cuisinart (???)....don't understand that one at all. Finally, you really cannot use the carafe to fill the water reservoir with water.....because it is impossible to get all the water out of the carafe. In addition, the pour spout drains so slowly ....it takes a lot of patience just to fill the reservoir and also to pour a cup of coffee. All of which I would not mind IF the Carafe kept the coffee hot at all. I guesss Cuisinart has really gone down hill!!! I am going to try another brand.....returning this one!! Bad coffee maker...you will be disappointed!!!  Really trying to warn other customers not to waste your money or time.

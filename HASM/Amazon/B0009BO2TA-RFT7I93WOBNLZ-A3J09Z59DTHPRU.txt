Title: Looks good, performs ok, falls apart though
Content:
I love to look at my little orange hoover and it doesn't do a bad job of cleaning up a 1 bed apartment that includes hard wood floors and a shaggy rug. But!!! It is SO annoying to use because the "telescoping chrome wands" will not stay fixed together. You will spend half of your cleaning time putting the attachements together...and watch out when they fall they don't break something. I hope Hoover read these reviews and change this design fault. Until they do I recommend you go for something else.

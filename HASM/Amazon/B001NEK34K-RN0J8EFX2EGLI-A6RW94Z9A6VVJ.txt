Title: You've heard the good
Content:
If I could go 2 1/2 stars I would have so I rounded up. All in all it's a nice looking computer although it sucks up finger prints like a magnet and there's really no point in cleaning it because it anything with fingers comes within 5 feet of it it's covered again. 
I'd be willing to bet that it just happens to be my computer but the mouse tends to freeze for 30seconds to a minute for about every hour of use I'd say. Also the mouse likes to skip about the screen and as you move the cursor about a web page if you get anywhere near the right side of the mouse pad it will scroll up and down at random, even after 3 hours of adjusting the settings on the mouse sensitivity and the hot zones of the mouse pad.
Another flaw with the mouse is the fact that it's completely flush with the rest of the computer making it easy to deviate from the mouse pad, you do get a little used to it. 
Lastly and what I feel is the most important is the fact that the power jack is garbage, I'm gentle with it and careful but the fact of the matter is that it...well it sucks. It's got multiple metal contacts on the inside which, initially is awesome but after a few months of general use they loose their spring back and just loosen up and don't hold in the power cord anymore. 
At best I would say this computer may be able to achieve an average status, definitely not what I would recommend spending my money on seeing as how you could undoubtedly do better.

Title: Not as good as the 2nd generation
Content:
The wide body styling is awkward and the smaller click wheel is harder to manuever. I have the 2nd generation and like it much better. I love the tall thin slick styling on it. The only plus with the 3rd gen is more gigs for your money, but bottom line it's styling holds it back. I'll be returning.

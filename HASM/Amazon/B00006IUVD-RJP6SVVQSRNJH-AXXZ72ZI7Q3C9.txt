Title: Great, basic one cup coffee maker
Content:
This is a great, basic coffee maker.  The cup it comes with is the only slight downfall as it's made of all plastic.  However, the handle is big enough for a man's hand and the lid fits tightly.  One of the best features of this maker is that you can use any standard size ceramic mug as well so you're not bound to the travel mug.  Works well with or without an added paper filter (size #1).

Title: works as a heater but not as an air conditioner
Content:
We bought this unit for its A/C function but it has failed miserably.  It hardly cools a room of any size.  After 2 hours, the most this unit would do is to drop 3 degrees Fahrenheit in a small corner of the room while the rest of the room's temperature remains unchanged.   One of the main problems might be due to the heat that its hose radiates.   I have used insulators bought from the hardware store but they didn't help. The hose temperature can reach as high as 130 degrees!    As a heater, this unit works fine.   Noise can be unbearable, however.

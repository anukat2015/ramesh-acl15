Title: Expensive, but worth it.
Content:
The macbook worked right out of the box,set-up was easy.I had a pc laptop (whose company name I won't say) and had all sorts of problems (slow boot-up, and screen and registry problems) I got so fed up, I decided to get rid of it.
While looking at laptops at Best Buy store, I looked at the macbook pro "15.4" which just happened to have the new Core i5 processor. At first, I balked at the price, the more I "played" with it, the more I liked it (And this is from someone who has NEVER owned a mac of any kind) And while I plan to keep my pc desktop, the macbook has become a welcome addtion to my household.

Title: Was skeptical, but I love it.
Content:
I bought this Cuisinart instead of the DCC-1200 because I wanted a thermal pot, not a glass carafe. I wasn't too keen on the grind feature, but after using it for a week, I LOVE it.Brewing from fresh-ground, high-quality beans is definitely the way to go. And it's so simple -- dump the beans in at night, wake up to a great cup. As for cleanup: big deal. When I have time, I wash out the grinder. If I'm in a rush (which is most mornings), I wipe it out with a paper towel. Small price to pay for really tasty coffee.Cuisinart must've redesigned the carafe, because mine is absolutely drip-free. After reading the negative reviews below, I tried to get mine to drip/spill, and I couldn't.The only reason I'm not giving this machine five stars is that the DCC-1200 looks so much cooler (though this model does look pretty good in my kitchen).

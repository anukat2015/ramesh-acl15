Title: Excellent entry level DSLR
Content:
Spent about 4 months reviewing various cameras.  After seeing the action photos and test driving the various Creative Zone modes, I saw for myself how easy it was to jump into the world of dSLR photography. The instruction manual is very basic, but the Canon website has a very good tutorial for those still learning the basics of dSLR.  
Upsides: 
Price and performance
Brand name= plethora of lenses and upgrade possibilities
Ease of use
Downside: 
Some don't like the lack of LCD viewer, but it really isn't needed at this level.
Manual
Kit lense-- thus the decision to go with the body only purchase

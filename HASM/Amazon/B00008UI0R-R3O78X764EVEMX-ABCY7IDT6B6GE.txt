Title: great vacuum
Content:
This has been a great vacuum.  Its really powerful with 3 different power speeds.  Its easy to put to gether and hall around.  The retractable cord is fantastic, easy to clean with a dump bagless tank.  The pipes are large so it never gets clogged.  It fluffs the carpet really nicely and works great.

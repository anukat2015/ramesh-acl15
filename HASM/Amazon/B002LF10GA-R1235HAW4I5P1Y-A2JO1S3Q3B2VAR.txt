Title: Not bad but a little slow
Content:
Not bad. fingerpring magnet. Battery - 6 hours average. Nice but not the best display. Nice keyboard. HDMI!!! Battery doesnt look bulky!!! THE BEST FINGERPRING MAGNET!!! Touchpad a little small and too sensitive. 
In general a little slow even on Win 7. 
Anyway, great value for ur money... i've had many netbooks )))

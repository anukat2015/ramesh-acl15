Title: Black IPOD Nano
Content:
I'll have to say Apple did a nice job on this one. They made it incredibly small. I would buy a case for it because it gets scrached easily. The headphones are okay but they don't stay in your ears real well. I have to tell you that some USB ports are powerful enough to charge the ipod. I had to go to best buy 3 times to get mine reset. Get a wall charger instead. They work a lot better.

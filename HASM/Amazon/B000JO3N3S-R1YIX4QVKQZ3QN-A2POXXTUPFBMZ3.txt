Title: Lasts so long
Content:
I absolutely love this Ipod.  Got one for a gift last Christmas and now I am giving one to someone else this Christmas.  Battery last's so long and it is so small and light.  The newer ones, I am told, needs to be recharged more.  So many accessories too for it.  Very easy to use as I was a 1st time Ipod user.

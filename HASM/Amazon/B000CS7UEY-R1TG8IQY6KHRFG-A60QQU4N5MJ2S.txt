Title: ****Beware look at the lower ratings before buying****
Content:
I am looking for my 2nd MP3 player. My first was a Rio purchased by a friend. That was a horrible Experience. It was so bad I believe they went out of business or they should. 
I guess that I am a little upset from a prior experience. I have been to several sights & people have complained about the following
1. Battery that doed not charge. This machine has a permanant battery so if your battery has issues you have no player...
2. The software does not load 
3. The player does not work right out of the box.
4. Ones that do work usually stop after 90 days & they only warrant it for 90 days. 
5. Customer service is awful (just like Rio)
I guess I'll just get a IPod... I have a better chance of sucess with that... I  read the same reviews about the Rio & thought that I was going to make a liar out of those users. I don't want to get burned again. Atleast the IPod warrants their peoduct for a year.. 
I rated this a 5 so people would see it.

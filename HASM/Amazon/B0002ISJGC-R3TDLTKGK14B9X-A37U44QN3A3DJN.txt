Title: Irritating coffee pot
Content:
This coffee pot is irritating because (1) you can't leave the pot in the sink to fill while you're doing other things because the lid won't stay up by itself so you have to wait.  (2) The coffee ground section is not separate from the water section so when you're pouring water in and aren't careful, it's very easy to pour water on top of your coffee grounds as well and then end up with little coffee grounds in your coffee. Had this coffee pot for about 4 days before I couldn't take it any more and had to buy a new one.  For the money and ease of use, you're better off buying the Black and Decker CMD3400MB 12 cup programmable coffee maker which runs about $35 to $40 depending on where you shop (Target has sales sometimes). Why? Lid stands up by itselfe, programming display is on top of the coffee pot (now I can read it easier), and the coffee is separate from the water. And, you can set strength of coffee.

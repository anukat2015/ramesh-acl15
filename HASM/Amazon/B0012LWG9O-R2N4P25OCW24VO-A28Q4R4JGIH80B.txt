Title: PIECE OF JUNK
Content:
I had heard rummors about the proprietary nature of the IPOD family but never understood it completely. Now I do. this is not a plug and play device like every other MP3 player i've ever bought. This device will only work if you install Apple's ITunes software on your computer. you cannot drag and drop songs, nor can Media player see it as a device. Definately going back to the store.

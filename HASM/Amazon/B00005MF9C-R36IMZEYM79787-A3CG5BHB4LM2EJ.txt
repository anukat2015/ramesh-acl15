Title: "Stainless Steel" mug is PLASTIC on the INSIDE!!
Content:
I give this product 2 stars b/c I did want a small, 1 cup coffee-maker and I like that there is a permanent filter.
HOWEVER, I specifically ordered this model b/c it advertised a stainless steel mug.  I tend to think that means stainless steel on the inside.  I always avoid plastic coffee cups/mugs b/c plastic heated to high temps (such as steaming hot coffee) can leach toxic chemicals.  It was very disappointing to receive this product NOT as advertised.  And why can't they just make a fully stainless steel product??  It would be worth the extra couple dollars it might cost...

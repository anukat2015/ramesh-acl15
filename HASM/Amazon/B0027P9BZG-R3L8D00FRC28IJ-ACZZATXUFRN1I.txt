Title: Minor problems, nice computer
Content:
Well, after a week using this computer, I have a few considerations for those wishing to get one:
Bad points
* Screen : Although very nice the 16" screens suffers from reflection, its a pain to get a good view position, bright environments makes it almost impossible
* Battery: The worst I ever had: Lasts less than 90 minutes with bright dimmed
* Keyboard: Really, really bad. the individual keys makes a lot of noise, and its somehow hard to press them, not as good as Macbooks
* Software: Every single software installed from Sony are broken (Vaio update, crashes all the time)
* Temperature: The place you are supposed to rest your right hand, next to the stickers  is really hot (maybe HD is beneath it)
Good points:
* Graphic card is really nice
* Sound: Good sound speakers
* Appearance: Its a Vaio no need to go further, very nice, beautiful piece of hardware
* Silent: Really quite, really nice to use

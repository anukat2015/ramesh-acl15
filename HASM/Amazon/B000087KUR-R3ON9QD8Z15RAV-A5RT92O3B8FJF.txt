Title: If you have a DCS-760, KEEP IT!
Content:
We owned the DCS-760 in our pro photo lab. The camera was great. Then, kodak came out with the DCS-14n as a replacement. It was a huge mistake. The DCS-14n's sensor is simply of lower quality, shadows sometimes come out magenta. There is also a flare issue. Grey gradients, depending on the density come out green or yellow. And there are other issues as well, but you get the point. In conclusion, the DCS-760 was a far better camera.Kodak recommends the use of a good lens with the DCS-14n to eliminate flare. We used the same lens to test both cameras, and the tests were performed under the same conditions. The results were very clear to us: keep the DCS-760.

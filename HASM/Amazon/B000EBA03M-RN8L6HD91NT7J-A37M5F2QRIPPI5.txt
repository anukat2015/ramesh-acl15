Title: I could have spent over $1000 for a camera with just as many features
Content:
But my wife would have killed me. For the past couple of years I started to get more into photography as a hobby. When a friend, who liked my photographs so much, asked me to photograph their wedding I decided I better invest in something more than just a little point and shoot camera. After doing much research between the Canon Rebel XT and the Olympus E500 I decided to purchase the Olympus and I can honestly say that I have not regretted it. Not only does the Olympus have advanced features that allow me to experiment with the look of my photos, it also has some functions that are familiar to point and shoot users so that someone like my wife can pick up the camera and not feel intimidated by it. The size and weight of the camera is not too big or heavy and the handle grip fits just right. That's more than I can say for the Rebel XT's small and somewhat cheap plastic feel. Yes there are better cameras out there but are well over the $1,000 mark, but it's great to go to a wedding, take pictures, and have people tell me that my photos came out just as good or better than the professional photographer that they hired.

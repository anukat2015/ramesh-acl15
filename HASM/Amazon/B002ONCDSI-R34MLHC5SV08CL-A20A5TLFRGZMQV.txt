Title: Avoid this Model of Computer
Content:
I bought a DM3 series computer in early December 2009.  At first I was amazed at how great the system was.  Then I found that it would freeze up every time I tried to close the lid and reopen it.  This is pretty fundamental for a laptop, so I figured I had loaded something that was having a problem.  After talking with HP tech support, however, I found out this is a known problem with the unit and that their solution was to shut the unit down every time you want to close it.  Unbelieveable that they would ship it with this kind of known error!!
DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!
Once they finally acknowledge this as a problem and they work on fixing it, it will be a great system.  For now, however, don't buy it unless you are willing to reset it every time you want to close it.

Title: Luke warm coffee
Content:
I liked the SS decanter and the looks of the coffee maker.  However there is no warmer plate to keep the coffee hot.  The directions spell this out.  They say to fill the decanter with hot water, wait 3 - 5 minutes, dump the hot water out, then make coffee.  Not practical if you are in bed and want to wake up to hot coffee.  Also there's a button that you have to press on the decanter lid to pour your coffee, since the lid is sealed.  Good idea, but the button is hard to push and the coffee comes out so slowly that I ended up taking the lid off so I could get the coffee out... I'm returning this one to my local store after one use.  If Mr. Coffee fixed these two problems, I'd love the coffee maker and give it five stars as the coffee tasted good, it was just not hot.

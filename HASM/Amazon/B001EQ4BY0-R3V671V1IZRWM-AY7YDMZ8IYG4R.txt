Title: 4/5 Stars
Content:
I am giving this camera 4-stars because of the lens it came with. The camera is GREAT. But if you get the lens package, you might notice that pictures aren't as sharp as they should be on a 15MP camera... but other than that, love the camera. It's user friendly & takes professional grade pictures. I only wish it had a video option.

Title: Worked OK for about a week
Content:
This heater promises a lot, and is certainly on the pricey side for an electric heater.  The remote is non-intuitive, and seems to require several button presses to get the heater to respond.  The remote's display shows you the current temperature, but not the temperature that you've set the thermostat to -- you have to look on the heater itself to see that.  It's also easy to change the heat setting (low, high, fan-only) without realizing it, unless you're looking at the heater's display while you're using the remote.  All that said, the heater is quiet, and does a good job of heating the room.  The auto-off after a set number of hours is a nice feature.
But here was the real problem for me -- the heater failed after one week of use.  We stepped out of the room for a few minutes, at a time when the heater was not heating, but was still turned on, and came back to a slight electrical odor in the air.  The heater was now off, and pressing the "on" button did nothing.  I verified that it was the unit and not a circuit breaker in my house.  Fortunately, I can return this item to where I bought it within 30 days for any reason.  While I have the option of getting a replacement, I don't think it's worth the risk.  The manufacturer has a 2-year warranty, but warranty service requires mailing the unit cross-country at my expense, PLUS a $20 shipping and handling fee to get the unit returned to me.  I don't want to get another and have it fail 31 days after I get it, so this one is going back.  Too bad, because I really like the concept!  But poor implementation and apparently poor reliability (sample of one) kills it for me.  Not recommended.

Title: Itouch review
Content:
The itouch is a great product. The docking part included in the package didn't make any sense on how to use it. I just discarded it. The interface is great. I use the itouch for mainly podcasts and when I get tired of them, to watch videos. The itunes store doesn't have many of the videos that I'd want. The instructions are very limited and not that helpful.

Title: The Absolute Best
Content:
The Bunn I purchased recently is the best coffee maker I have ever owned. My neighbor has had one for a few years now and I always wondered why her coffee tasted so much better than mine, considering we were buying the same coffee (Starbucks, Pikes Place). She said "it's my Bunn"
I would absolutely recommend the Bunn. You wont be sorry!

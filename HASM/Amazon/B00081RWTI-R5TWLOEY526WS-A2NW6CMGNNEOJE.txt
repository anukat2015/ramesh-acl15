Title: Grind & Brew needs more development
Content:
I bought this product based on the recommendation of a good friend.  He's had the early generation Grind & Brew for several years.  The older design does not include the thermal carafe.
I'm mostly disappointed in this coffee maker because of it's inferior design. There are too many pieces to clean which can too easily be broken. The grinder has no settings for grinding regular, medium or fine.
The coffee maker urgently needs additional research & development to improve the product.
There are several plastic parts that are not built for strength or durability.  The first unit I received was broken as a result of the poor design and cheap plastic parts.
I had to return the first unit since the plastic guide for the slide-out apparatus which holds the basket & filter had completely sheered off the inside of the housing where the carafe sits.
Before you consider buying this coffee maker, be sure to check it out in a local store, and very carefully examine the design and function of the grinder and basket slide-out unit.  You may want to consider a unit without the grinder, since with a separate grinder, you can control how course or fine you prefer your beans to be ground.

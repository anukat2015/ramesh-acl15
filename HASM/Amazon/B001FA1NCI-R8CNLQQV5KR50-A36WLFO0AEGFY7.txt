Title: Apple ipod 16 GB Review
Content:
When the ipods came out a few years ago I didn't get all the hipe. I finally bought one a few weeks ago. I purchased the nano 16 gig. I have about 100 songs on it so far and this thing is great. I also purchased the Altec Lansing sound dock from Amazon. Together with the ipod these purchases are the best thing I have bought in years. Don't waste your money on the Bose sound dock. For half the cost the t612 is almost as good. The only problem I have is the nano is so small and thin that I am afraid I will crush it or break the display.

Title: Hoover Windtunnel Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I have not had a canister vacuum for 25 years, so I was reluctant to try this one. Plus, the last bagless vacuum I tried got everything dirty. That being said, however, it is clear that canister vacuums are much better engineered today than uprights, which is what I have been using for years. The Hoover has very easy to use attachments, and the canister rolls like a dream. No yanking on the nozzle required! The only flaw I have found so far is that the belt slips off the brush roller occasionally while in use. But that's it. I have a large house with old, uneven wood floors and wall-to-wall carpeting in the bedrooms, a longhaired cat, mud tracked in from the garden, and a staircase and screened porch. The Hoover handles it all. The floor tool is especially good, and the roller brush for carpeting is very easy to use. I like how the suction can be controlled with a touch of the finger on the handle as well as how quietly it runs.

Content:
i have lived in my apartment(house) for ten years..... in those ten years i have used an old red hoover uprite bagged vacuum in those years i have placed new carpeting on the stairs and in the walk-in closet (the rest is hard wood and throw rugs)   i had finally had it when the hoover wouldn't stand in upright position when not in use     i had always seen my mother and many maids using canister vacs to clean my childhood  house ......so naturally i wanted a canister vac     i read reviews   wanted a dyson really bad   but in the end i got the hoover   and couldn't be happier      i can't believe the dirt,dust and carpet fibers from the 8 year old carpet that i get every time i use this machine       i would like to mention that the dirt cup could and should be bigger  but i LOVE this vacuum    LOVE LOVE LOVE    also the tools need to find there way on to the base

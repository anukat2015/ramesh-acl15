Title: "Entry level" D-SLR that ROCKS!
Content:
I have done a lot of research before I purchased this camera.  Still I got a few pleasant surprises (BTW all the good things you have heard are also true):
1. The pictures are prettier than I thought, especially regarding the color and contrast. I have heard warnings that D-SLRs do not automatically give you better-looking pictures and that you need to understand the camera better to get the job done right.  That is not so for D-50.  It does automatically gives you better-looking pictures. (Of course the more you understand the better.) Don't assume the more expensive cameras necessarily take better pictures. D-50 has done some smart processing in camera. And there are plenty of adjustments you can make to suit different tastes.  
2. The ergonomics and control layouts matter more than I thought.  And Nikon got it right.  A pure joy to use.
3. 6MP is just enough for me.  I do look at my pictures close up on screen but do not make large print often.  I did not find myself missing the higher megapixels.  Higher megapixels actually means inconveniently larger files for most people.  Don't oeverestimate how important the megapixels are to you.  Be realistic.
4. Low noise is no hype.  It makes pictures look perceivably better and there is less quality loss after post-processing.
5. BTW I am using Nikkor DX 18-200 VR lens.  It's a great companion for D50.

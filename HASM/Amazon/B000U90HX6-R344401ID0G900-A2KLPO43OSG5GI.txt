Title: Great heater for our S FL long winter weather...
Content:
I purchased 4 different brands/models of heaters for our 2009/2010 winter here in S Fl because my house does not have a heating system... Hello!!! this is S Fl LOL. By far this is my favorite. I've to turn it off in the middle of the night because my bedroom gets really warm. It is not enough for my living room/dinning room but it does well for my bedroom. FYI.- Our cold fronts here get on the 50's to 40 degrees.

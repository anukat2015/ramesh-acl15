Title: Don't waste your money
Content:
I bought FIVE of the Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heaters at the beginning of the 2008-2009 winter season, from different merchants. (1 from amazon). Of the five, THREE are no longer working. One chugs on and off, and one never heated, right out of the box (the amazon one). The third worked for a few days and then just stopped. Don't waste your money on this model.

Title: Extremely Disappointed
Content:
Never know what to expect from this thing.  One time it makes coffee, the next it pumps water and coffee all over my kitchen counter.  The coffee tastes the same as my old 29.99 Mr. Coffee so I can't even say anything good about it when it doesn't flood my kitchen.  Not worth the money at all.

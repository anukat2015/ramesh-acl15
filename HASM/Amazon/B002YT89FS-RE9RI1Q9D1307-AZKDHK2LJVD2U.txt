Title: In response to the one "Bad" review
Content:
I purchased my Vaio NW through a different company, had to return it and now will be buying the identical laptop through Amazon.  In response to the "bad" review: I thought my computer was "used" due to all the photos and stuff the bad review mentioned, my roommate (computer guru) took a look at it, the pictures and such were actually placed on the computer by Sony! Possibly in an effect to show how "great" everything looks. So, besides needing to delete a great deal of extraneous stuff, this is a WONDERFUL laptop.

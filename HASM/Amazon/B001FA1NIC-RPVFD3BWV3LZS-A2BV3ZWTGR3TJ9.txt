Title: An amazing little instrument
Content:
My reason for getting an iPod was to play iTunes from my computer in a dock for listening in my living room. I have a large number of music CDs that I never listened to because of the bother of hunting them up. It is so simple to feed them into my computer and then into the iPod. It is easy to operate and  works wonderfully. I was never much for feeding CDs into a player and having to change them ever little bit. I would recommend an iPod in a music dock as the way to go if you want continuous background music for any situation.

Title: Overated BTU's
Content:
We attempted to use this unit to cool a small computer room.(10x10x8 insulated)Without any cooling the room would get to about 85 degrees. With the unit set to 68 degrees the best it can do is take the temp down to 77 degrees. Some may say we are expecting too much from this unit but I owned a 12,000 btu window unit for my home and I can tell you this unit does not put out any where near the same amount of cold air. I can guarantee my old window unit would keep this little room cool(cold). From what I have read it appears all of these portable units are way overated for their BTU's. I would estimate the output as being 50% of what they are advertising. The two duct design is a great idea but the exhaust duct creates a tremendous amount of radiant heat to the point of being counter-productive to the cool air being produced.

Title: Softwar problems are NOT resolved!
Content:
I'm sure the Zune is a great product although I wouldn't know because I WAS NEVER ABLE TO USE THE ONE I PURCHASED!!!  After hours of attempting to install the software, re-installing the software, installing patches, downloading updates, troubleshooting and following Microsoft technical difficulties suggestions I could NEVER get the software to recognize my Zune.  I can't think of a more worthless product that forces you to go through hours of work just to use it for the first time.  This was pathetic.  I returned it after 3 days.  I was a long time I-pod user but was annoyed at Apple's user/song restrictions so was very excited by the specs and functionality of the Zune - especially the FM radio and song identification features.  But all the cool features mean nothing if you can't get the product to work!  I was more than happy to leave my Apple days behind me.  But no explanation can possibly justify the hours I had to spend just getting the device up and running  There is simply no excuse for this.  As usual, Microsoft should be ashamed of the quality of their software.  Unfortunately, I'm going back to Apple.

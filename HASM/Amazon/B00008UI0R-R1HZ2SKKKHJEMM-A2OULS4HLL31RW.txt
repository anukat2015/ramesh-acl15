Title: HooverS3765-040 Wind Tunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I am liking my new Hoover.  It is light and easy to move around. The most important thing to me is that it picks up the dirt well...and it really does. Also, I like having choices of suction.  On some thinner rugs, the lightest suction does the job and the ends of the rugs don't get torn apart. I also like the how the dirt cannister  clicks out easily and it is easy to figure out how it is replaced back.  Finally,if something was stuck where the brushes are, easy directions are given to fix the problem. I found out that I don't need some heavy machine to do a great job.

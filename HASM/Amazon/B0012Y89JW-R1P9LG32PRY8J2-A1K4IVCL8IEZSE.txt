Title: Canon Rebel XSi 12mp Excellent Camera
Content:
I love this Camera, it has alot of options on it to work with that in time come easy to use, but also as a point and shoot, this thing is awesome!! I have big hands and it works well for me, the buttons and the menu are very user friendly, you manually zoom and it is so quick to focus and take the picture, is well wow, and quick burst, this thing is insane. The quality of picture that this camera produces, when I print them they are some of the best I have seen. Well worth your money. Best Camera I have ever owned.

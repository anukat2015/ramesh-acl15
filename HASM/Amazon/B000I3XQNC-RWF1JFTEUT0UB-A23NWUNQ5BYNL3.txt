Title: GREAT CAMERA!
Content:
I purchased the 400D from a store in England, so I over paid a bit for it(the US dollar to pound exchange rate sucks), but it was still worth it.  When I went in, I was leaning towards the Nikon D60, but when compared I found I liked the Cannon better.  It was a little cheaper than the D40, but has so many more features (the Cannon was the better camera.)  I would Recommend this camera to anyone.

Title: Great Little Bean
Content:
I could have purchased something a little cheaper with the same storage size, but we love Sony products so I went with this after looking at mp3 players for a long time.
It is SO Cute!  Mom's need a few cute things that are their own.
512MB seems miniscule compared to the multi-GB models of players out there now, but really, I just download radio show files that I don't get to listen to normally to listen to them when I walk...along with 50 or 60 songs that I really like.  So it's perfect for me.  You can always swap them out.  Plus I'm not storing my entire music library on there, and I don't think most people that have everything loaded on their players listen to 10% of the files.
I LOVE the USB connect/charger.  Easy to use.
The software isn't so bad.  My computer is just under a year old, so that might help.  I'm still trying to figure out the details on it, but I never read the instructions so it's my own fault...and thanks to the other reviewer that mentioned the wallpaper thing.  I don't wear a watch normally, so the fact you can put a clock on there is great to know.
Only downside I've come across is the slow fast forward function...I get by though.

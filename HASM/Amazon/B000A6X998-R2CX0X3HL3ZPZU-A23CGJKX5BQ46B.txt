Title: Reasonably quiet, good heat for a small area only
Content:
This heater works well in a small area like a den or a small bedroom, but in my 14 x 14 kitchen it just can't put out enough heat to make a big difference.  It is better as a heater to put near your feet in a chilly room or in a room that needs a "boost".  But a grat deal for the money, and I'd buy another if I needed a space heater for another small room. Not too noisy and I feel better knowing it will shut off if it tips over.

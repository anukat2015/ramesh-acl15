Title: Great for first-timers.
Content:
This is a user-friendly camera for first-timers which features an auto mode but you can switch to various help programs in manual mode.  
This is a great feature for helping photographers migrate from point and shoot to a D-SLR format. 
It's not as robust as most cameras but then again, the next step up requires a heftier budget.  
The images are great - even if it's "only 6.1 megapixels"...  how much can the eye really see?  It's a great camera for the money and photo quality is 
better than average.  And most importantly, it's the right price!!

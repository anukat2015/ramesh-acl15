Title: Very Good product and working pefectly
Content:
I bought this for my personal, family use and this camera takes excelent pics. i dont miss any pic with this as it takes very fast and accurate to the object. i have 18-55mm lens this has bit less range to zoom, i may have to go for bit longer one. i am using cam from past 6months and it works great.

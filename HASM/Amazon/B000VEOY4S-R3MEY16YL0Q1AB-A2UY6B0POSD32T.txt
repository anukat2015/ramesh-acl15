Title: Nice vacuum
Content:
I did not realize Black & Decker made a full sized plug-in vacuum cleaner so I gave this one a try for our basement. It is beautifully designed and made and really works well. It comes with a whole bunch of attachments (I haven't even used them all). It is powerful but sounds quiet and high quality when turned on. It's easy to empty without getting your hands dirty and feels as well made as the dyson I have. It also has a great cord rewind feature which makes putting it away much easier than the dyson.
I definitely recommend it, especially for those looking for a high quality canister type vacuum cleaner.

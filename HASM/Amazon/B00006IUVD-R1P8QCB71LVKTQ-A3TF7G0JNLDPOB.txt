Title: Orininal one was Great - This is Junk
Content:
I am the only coffee drinker in my family and had a Brew N' Go for over 6 years when the mesh filter began to separate from the plastic.  Unfortunately, Black and Decker changed the design and I was unable to find a replacement filter from them or anybody.  I looked for a replacement single cup coffee maker in several retailers and finally found one on Amazon at a very reasonable price. 
However, newer is not better.  The new model filter only has screen on the 2 sides and is mostly plastic, where as the original was mostly a fine screen with plastic reinforcement.
From the very first cup it was a disappointment, as coffee grounds overflowed into my cup and throughout the coffee maker.  This new design filter does not let the water pass through quick enough when you use a fine or moderate grinds of coffee.  With larger grinds the coffee comes out weak,  or if you try to make it stronger by adding more grinds you can have the same overflow problem! For months I would put coarse coffee in the bottom and the better fine ground coffee on top and crossed my fingers.
Then the other day I was in CVS and saw a single cup coffee maker for 15 bucks.  It has a mostly screen filter like the original B&D and works great!  The next day I was in Big Lots and found another one that appears to use a #2 filter (so replacements can be easy in the future) and it works great for 10 bucks!!
The Black and Decker is going in the trash!!  Save yourself the hassle and get something else and make sure it has a lot of screen area in the filter.

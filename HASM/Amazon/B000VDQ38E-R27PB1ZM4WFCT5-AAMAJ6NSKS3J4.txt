Title: buyer beware
Content:
I got this vacuum today, spent about 10 minutes vacuuming only to have dirt spew behind the vacuum everywhere.  Then the filter door wouldn't stay shut.  Not sure if I got a defective one or this is what you get.  Also, the canister that captures the dirt doesn't really capture the hair, instead the top compartment captures the hair (which you can't remove), thus you need to use a chop stick or something similar to pull the caught hair down, which leaves a huge mess on the vacuum and floor.  Super poor design to say the least.
I called Amazon and will get a refund (they were great), and now have to deal with the hassle of lugging this box to UPS.  Save yourself some trouble and listen to the reviews (which I regretfully didn't).

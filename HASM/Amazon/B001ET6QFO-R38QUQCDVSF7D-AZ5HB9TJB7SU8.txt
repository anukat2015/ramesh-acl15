Title: Awewsome, but
Content:
Got the 50d body yesterday ... I had an awesome time with it since then, but I had 2 ERRORS .. the 99 error and the Busy error, I ended up taking the battery out each time and it seemed to work, hopfuly this wont last, if it happens again, I will take it back to replace it. But YES it is really cool!

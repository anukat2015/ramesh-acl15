Title: A television star coffee maker
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for over 2 years and absolutely love it.  The comments from others about spills onto the counter - I too have experienced that, but it is HUMAN ERROR - not the fault of the coffee maker.  One you read the instructions closely and follow them, never a spill!  And, what a beautiful addition to any kitchen counter. And the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours and hours.
The coolest thing about this coffee maker is its television star status.  It is the identical coffee maker seen in the family kitchen of Nora Walker from the Sunday night hit series, Brothers and Sisters.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw my coffee maker on that show.  I had to pause the DVR and rewind it and play in slo-mo...and yep, it was the same machine....
I was so impressed with this product that I went out and bought the Cuisinart Expresso Maker - another purchase I will not soon regret.  Congrats to Cuisinart for such outstanding products!

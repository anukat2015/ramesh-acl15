Title: Best vacuum hands down!
Content:
As a european I think there are so many wonderful things this country has to offer but vacuum cleaners is not one of them. I can not stand the big, bulky american vacuum cleaner models. Before I bought this one I had another canister model that worked fine and held up well. But it was much heavier and the suction wasn't as strong. This machine is very light yet cleans and feels amazingly heavy duty, plus it is a great price. I am very happy. I used to feel vacuuming was such a chore, and I vacuum a lot with three little boys in the house, but now it is a breeze!

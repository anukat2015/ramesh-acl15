Title: Would be a great unit if it turned off.
Content:
I checked with the manufacture before returning this unit for credit. The heater is designed go to a low power output when the desired temperture is reached but not to turn off. I like to leave a heater on in a small office to keep the chill off some plants during cool nights and weekends. So I don't forget to turn it on I leave the heater power on and the thermostat set to turn the heater on when the room gets chilly. With this heater not turning off the room gets way to hot on a relitivly warm day. With people becoming more and more energy concious I can't believe a manufacture would design a heater that does not turn off when it is no longer needed for heat.

Title: From D50 to D80, No Regrets...
Content:
I had the Nikon D80 for about a year, and had been eyeing the D80 since it was released. Although I already had a slew of Nikon lenses, I was tempted by going for the Canon 30D, and after doing extensive research and playing around with both the 20D and the 30D to compare with the D80. It wasn't even close. The D80 felt solid, and the photographs are remarkable.  I like the low noise on higher ISO of the 20D and the 30D, but the difference isn't that much more significant between them and the D80.  The 18-135mm lens is a great walk around lens, but the vignetting at higher zoom is really annoying.

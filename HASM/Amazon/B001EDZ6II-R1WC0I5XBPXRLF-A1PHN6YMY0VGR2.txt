Title: Disappointing
Content:
I bought this heater based on some reviews - the features mentioned in other reviews I actually mostly agree with. It is quiet, it has a nice display and the unit is small. But - as far as effectiveness as a heater it stinks. Unless you're heating a very small room it's inadequate. I have some other small space heaters and they are more noisy but they run less and heat more. I'd trade the quiet for better throughput. When the vornado runs for a long time (hours) The output seems to be noticeably less warm than when it first runs. The unit also has a safety feature which automatically turns it off in case it's tipped. This is a great safety feature that should be in all space heaters but on the vornado the switch is so sensitive that it sometimes turned off even if it's just lightly bumped even though it's still sitting completely upright. Even on hardwood floors I have to go press the unit down to get it to start heating again. I would not buy another and am even more upset at its poor heating given its high price.

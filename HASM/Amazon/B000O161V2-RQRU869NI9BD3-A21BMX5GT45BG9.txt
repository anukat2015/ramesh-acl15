Title: They break quickly and very poor build quality.
Content:
Right after 1 year the built-in flash on my D40x broke. Oddly, built-in flashes on other cameras I own, such as a 10 year old Sony still work fine. Whether this is an engineering issue or a build issue I'm not sure, but apparently there are many others with this exact problem. This is my first Nikon purchase and at this moment it will absolutely be the last. If I thought this camera was going to brake this quickly I would not have purchased it. It really would have helped if someone could have warned me about this, such as the dealer. But they didn't, and so I write this information for you. Nikon has followed up by providing awful customer support about the issue. My current advice is: do not buy a Nikon product or you might regret it.
So I sent the camera in to Nikon for repair. While they did fix the flash they completely ignored the navigation problem, took my money, and sent the camera back to me with no explanation of why the repair was ignored. Now Nikon has had me ship the camera back a 2nd time. So, folks, this is what you're dealing with when you choose Nikon as the manufacturer for your camera. Bad build quality. Bad customer service. The camera came back a 2nd time with a working navigation pad but a re-broken flash. Now the flash does not even pop up. Sent the camera to Nikon a 3rd time and they promised to replace the camera. No replacement arrived so I called in and now they have no record of me being offered a replacement. Endless phone calls and arguments are now taking place over what should have been a simple repair. I can now say with complete confidence that Nikon is a terrible company that should be avoided at all costs. 3/19/2010

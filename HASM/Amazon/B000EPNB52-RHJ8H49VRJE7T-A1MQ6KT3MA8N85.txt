Title: GREAT NEW IPOD!!!
Content:
G'day pplz,
I bought this iPod about a week bak, n even now i am still finding new things about it!!! this iPod is deffiently worth $200 odd buks. the screen is nice as quality, n the click wheel is easy to use. i previously had a blue iPod mini, n i wanted to get a newer model one, n even after 2 n a half years of using the mini, it barely had any scratches!!! seriously, i rekon this is the one of the best cases on any iPod models!! the normal one gets scratched WAY too easily, but this aliminium case is really good on not absorbing scratches, but more hiding em. 
In conclusion, its a really nice iPos, with all the bells n whistles, and at a fair dinkum price too. plus, the one year warranty makes u hav peace of mind for up to one year, or if u buy thr extended warranty then its up to 2 year!!!

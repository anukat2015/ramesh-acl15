Title: Not worth the price
Content:
I bought this for my daughter to replace her 3rd generation Nano that broke.  I am very dissappointed in this product.  It constantly freezes up for no reason.  I will never by another Nano.  I have a Classic and I love it.  Save your money and go for the Touch or Classic and pass on the Nano.

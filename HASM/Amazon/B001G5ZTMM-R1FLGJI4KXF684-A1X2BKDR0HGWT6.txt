Title: A Star that fizzled
Content:
I enjoy this camera as a still photography camera, but this is not only still photography camera and few who would purchase this camera would regard it as such. This camera is a digital still and motion picture camera that lacks essential features such as Manual Control and 24p. Features easily created, features that were not forgotten or overlooked, but deliberately withheld by the Camera's manufacturer. Companies like Red, Panasonic, Sony, and Nikon all stand to profit from Canon's glaring mistake and Canon has everything to lose in this increasingly competitive market. Simply by withholding features like manual control, Canon has not demonstrated the ability to provide professional solutions in a converging market. I will look elsewhere if these problems are not resolved.
My review is simple. This camera is only half of what it could easily be. If this change is made in a firmware update, I will HIGHLY recommend the camera and L-series lenses to all my professional colleagues. Until then, I will steer them in other directions.
Call Canon to address your Manual concern!

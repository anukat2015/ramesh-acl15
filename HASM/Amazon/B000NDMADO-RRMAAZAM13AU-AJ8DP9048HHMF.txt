Title: This vacuum sucks !
Content:
So far, overall, I like the vacuum but compared to my Sears Kenmore canister, it is cheaply made.  For the price, it should have had a longer cord, better made hose and attachments.  You cannot vacuum berber because it literally pulls the carpet fiber into the vacuum and ruins your carpet.  DO NOT vacuum berber throw rugs with it !

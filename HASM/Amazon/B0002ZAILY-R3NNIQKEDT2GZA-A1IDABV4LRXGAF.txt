Title: Looking for a GREAT Deal - GET A SHUFFLE!!
Content:
Before purchasing the iPod Shuffle, I looked at several different players.  I found the prices to be ridiculously high.  Maybe some people actually have a need to have 1,000 plus songs at their reach, but not me.  I just wanted something that I could carry along with me for a walk with my dog, or a stroll with the baby, etc.  The Shuffle is the perfect little gadget for such uses.  I am amazed at its sleek design and how easy it is to use.  I had never used iTunes before and found it to be very simple.  At first I thought that the lack of a display was a problem, but then I thought, "I'm loading it with songs I WANT to hear, so what difference does it make?"  If I am listening and something happens to come on that I am not in the mood for, I simply skip forward to the next song.  
In short, if you are looking for an affordable, simple gadget to meet basic music needs then get an iPod Shuffle.  If you are looking to transfer your entire CD collection, get something different

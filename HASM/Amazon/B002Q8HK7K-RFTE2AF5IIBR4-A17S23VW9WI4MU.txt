Title: Wow!  Sleek, fast, and high end computer
Content:
I spent days researching laptops when my Dell Latitude died.   Everyone I knew told me to get a Mac, but for what I wanted, it would have cost around $1600.  I kept seeing the Asus brand in online reviews named as an Editor's Choice.   I can now see why...  This is a great computer.  It's sleek, fast, easy to use, and very lightweight.  
In case you don't know, Asus makes the motherboards for Mac computers, so this is just as fast and reliable as a Mac (and even more so since they had the lowest number of complaints out of all the computer companies).  
My only gripe would be the track pad is a bit tricky, but I have a wireless mouse that I use anyway. 
This is a fantastic machine and with the warranty and reliability, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.

I don't think it's the computer, but my Windows 7 keeps freezing.   It freezes about 20 times a day and then the entire system needs to be restarted.  It's perhaps the most annoying thing in the entire world.  I find myself using the Asus Express Gate where you have quick access to the internet, but then you can't print...  So I open Windows 7 and then the computer freezes for some unknown reason over and over again.  Considering returning the computer for a Macbook.

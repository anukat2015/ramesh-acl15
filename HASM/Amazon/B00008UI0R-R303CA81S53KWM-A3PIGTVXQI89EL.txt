Title: Powerful, quiet, compact, best in class!
Content:
With this new Hoover WindTunnel canister, I am in love with vacuuming.  It's so quiet and so powerful that it picked up so much dirt my previous Hoover canister didn't pick up.  Unbelievable!!~  I had to keep emptying the dirt.  Best of all...No more bags to buy.  At first, I was considering of buying a Dyson, but refrained from buying an upright because it's not stair friendly and extremely pricy.  Since this has 4.5 stars on Amazon from 147 users, we made the plunge to buy this canister windtunnel without checking it out in the stores.  I was worried that I'll be disappointed and ended up returning, but I must say this is the best purchase ever.  Absolutely one of the best vacuum for the price.  Dyson doesn't do any better than this. You can't go wrong with this one.  Two thumbs up!!

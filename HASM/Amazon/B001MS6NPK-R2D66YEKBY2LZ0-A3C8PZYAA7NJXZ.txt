Title: Lovely and stylish laptop!
Content:
Pros:
* Super stylish number with very nice LEDs and a sexy pink color
* Powerful specifications (Intel Core 2 Duo, 250 GB hard drive, DVD writer)
* Fast graphics and wireless connectivity
* Ample USB ports, Firewire
* Solid software because it has 64-bit Windows Vista Home Premium with SP1
Cons:
* Not all might like the pink color
* Typing on keyboard gives some noise (not very silent)
* A lot of bloatware - you might want to remove them

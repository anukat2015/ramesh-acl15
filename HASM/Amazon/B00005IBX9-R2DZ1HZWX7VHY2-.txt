Title: Cool Machine, Cool Coffee
Content:
Someone else posted about cold coffee.  I love this machine, but the coffee is tepid after I add my 1/2&amp;1/2 which was not the case with my last, old, Krups coffeemaker.  I like the Cuisinart so much though that I'll exchange it for a new one and see if that will do the trick because everything else on it is great.  The flavor of my coffee is excellent, but it's hard to savor when it's at gulping temperature.  I will update this post after I try another machine.

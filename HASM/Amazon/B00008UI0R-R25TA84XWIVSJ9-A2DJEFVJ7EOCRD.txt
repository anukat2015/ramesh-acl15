Title: Great Vacuum for the Money
Content:
I was very skeptical of this vacuum at first because of the price.  I believe strongly in "you get what you pay for."  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have definitely used better, but have also paid $400.  Here is a brief summary of my pros and cons.
PROS:
Great suction power, extremely light weight, standard attachments, bagless, HEPA, Long cord, digital indicator for suction speed, hand controls for suction control on the handle, automatic retractable cord.
CONS:
No adjustable height on power nozzle for the floors (You only have one height), Cord retractor sometimes stops 90% of the way, mini power brush is not motorized but runs off suction, power  cord for the power nozzle is not concealed but run on the outside of the wand.
Overall I would say this is a great vacuum for the money, it does a great job on my hard floors and carpets.  Despite the fact that the power nozzle isn't adjustable it doesn't affect its cleaning ability on any surface I have come into contact with.  For less than ½ the price of my previous vacuum I think I can live without the extras that I quickly forgot about after a few times of use.

Title: WOW!! Apple iWHAT?
Content:
I have to say that iam a person who doesnt like to waste money and therefore likes to do research before a purchase, and therefore when I decided to upgrade mp3 players I didnt know whether to get another Ipod (I have a nano) or to try the new Zune. Well, I have read many of the reviews on here about how bad zunes are and how faulty the software is, but decided to try something different from the ipod. Well, to say the least I think the people who are complaining about how bad the Zune is and its malfunctioning should look at themselves before they blame the machine..This is the greatest Mp3 player ever, better than the Ipod, and I owned Ipods since they came out. The software and hardware is incredible. The 3 inch screen is awesome and iam quite impressed by the integretion of a radio tuner as well in the Zune...I could go on for hours about things the Zune has the Ipod doesnt...Well, the Ipod does have a clock and games, but I would rather have a radio tunes than a clock, thats what I have a watch for...Needless to say, great job Microsoft!

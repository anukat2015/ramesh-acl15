Title: delonghi Heater
Content:
SUGGESTION;  I beleive Amazon should wait at least 60 days to ask for a review of products. Reading a review in such a short time is not beneficial to a future consumer. Xample, if someone buys a heater of sorts in a warm month,,, How can they give an honest opinion of it?
I, on the other hand, have used The Delonghi on occasion for overnite use and after that amount of time, I will rate it a 9 only because to understand the directions was a bit confusing, or it would be a 10.
The consumer is to understand it is a SPACE heater.
I am VERY satified with it.

Title: so far so good...
Content:
I bought an archos about 5 years ago from Gateway and returned it in 2 days.  I was waiting for something like the AV700 that would actually work, unlike the first one I bought - which I bought predominantly for my digital photo collection.
The archos is well made, solid, and easy to use.  dragging wma and mp3 files was absolutely no problem and I transferred 7gb of digital photos without a problem.
HOWEVER....at least out of the box, I couldn't get my digital photos which had voice memos' to synchronize, nor could I get my .avi files from digital camera to go over.  In fact, I still can't figure out how to copy and transform a video whether from email, digital camera, or a DVD burned from a camcorder tape on a Philips DVD recorder.  
A call to ARchos didn't help a bit.  There have been some criticisms of their tech support; i've emailed twice this week with no response; at least the phone tech answered.  I've tried some things, upgraded some apps and will call again, but unlike the seamless .jpg and .wma transfers, the video is elusive.  I would probably buy this again, but I would definitely by the 100GB version, and will withold the final 2 stars of my rating until I see if I can ever get video to work.

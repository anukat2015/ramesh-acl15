Title: NOT A FAN..... (no pun intended)
Content:
I gave this heater 2 chances... I bought it and started to use it and it smelled so bad i had to turn it off. I figured maybe becasue its the first time- so i tried it again later and it still smelled horrible. I returned the heater and decided to buy another one- and yet again the smell was so bad. Bad to the point that I thought i was going to be ill. I left it on anyways to see how it was with heating up the room and was very disapointed. 
The only good thing about this heater is that it has a remote ... whoop de doo .. dont waste your money or time.

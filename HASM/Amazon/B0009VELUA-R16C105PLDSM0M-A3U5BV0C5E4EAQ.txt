Title: Disappointed
Content:
This expensive coffee maker looks like a well-made, brand-name kitchen appliance, but don't be fooled.  It is a poorly designed and apparently fragile machine with many faults, not the least of which is it's life span, or lack of.  It is hard to clean after use, allows water (condensate) to run down the back and onto the counter when the lid is opened and splashes unless tall cups are used.  Twelve months after this overpriced piece of junk came into my kitchen, it simply and without warning, stopped working. Given the 3-year warranty, I returned it to Linens & Thing, where I purchased it and they, surprisingly, gave me another one without question.  In fact, I got the impression from the customer service representative that this wasn't the first failure of this coffee maker she'd seen... when she called the stock room to bring one up, she didn't even give the model number, just asked for one of "those Cruisinarts (her pronounciation)coffee makers".  The second one lasted 14 months before again simply failing to come on one morning.  No amount of fooling with the controls and plugging and unplugging would bring it back to life. Neither of these coffee makers were ever subjected to abuse and were keep clean (although cleaning is a major chore and should be done after every use) and had vinegar run through every month. Bottom line, this last one went into the dumpster and I bought a $20 Mr. Coffee.  At least, if it stops working in a year, my average annual cost for coffee makers will be less than the $50 for the Cuisinart.  If I could, I would not give even one star to this POS.

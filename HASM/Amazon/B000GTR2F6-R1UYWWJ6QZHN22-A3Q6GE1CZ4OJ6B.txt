Title: Slow to start, but seems better now
Content:
We bought this maker as an upgrade. We have 2 of the smaller older models both in our offices. This one looks great, makes a wider variety of sizes, makes a hot fast cup, and is VERY quiet. The big problem we encountered was it required a full day of decanting (running vinegar through the machine instead of water) to get the flavor cleaned up. The initial 15 cups tasted so much like PLASTIC we had to dump them! So after a series of decanting and then running only water for about 10 containers full, it is now making a tasty cup of regular coffee. Of course, this may not be the coffee maker for people who love the last cup from a pot that's been brewing all day.

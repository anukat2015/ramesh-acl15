Title: Disappointing
Content:
I thought this would be a nifty replacement for my 4-cup coffee maker.  The permanent filter and the travel mug were great selling features.  I stopped using it after only a month because it wouldn't brew coffee strong enough.  Anything more than a tablespoon of coffee causes it to splatter everywhere.  The unit is terribly difficult to clean after something like that.  Stick to a good coffee maker and a good travel mug.

Title: quality & safety concern?
Content:
This heater came out of the box with the control panel hanging off & bared wires. Makes me wonder about the quality of the manufacturers product & raises safety concerns about an item that is supposed to be left connected to a power supply. Needless to say I am returning for a refund.

Title: Best Vacuum I've owned!
Content:
I love this vacuum! It has great features, is easy to clean, and does a great job! We have a cat who, of course, sheds like crazy and this does a good job of picking up the fur and everything else. Great suction power on the tools. They include this little filter cleaning brush which is extremely handy.  This is lightweight and has a strong handle to lift the canister by. The long retractable cord is wonderful, no more winding and winding...you get the idea. The bagless container is very easy to take out dump and put back in. It's a little noisy but it's quieter than others I've owned so it isn't bad...doesn't even scare the cat. The head is flat enough to easily fit under furniture. It was very easy to put together. We've had it for a few months and really, really love it.  It's a great buy!

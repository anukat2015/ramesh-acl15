Title: Comfortable and appealing heat
Content:
The Dimplex CS1205 is small and has no thermostat built in, but it is very comfortable to sit next to (instantly warms your feet), and works great as supplemental heat on cold mornings or to heat a small room as the sole source in our Pacific NW winter (very little snow). It's appealing to watch the flame, and the stove is not hot to the touch. I now have two of them, one in the studio and one in the kitchen. I have no idea of its durability yet, just bought mine last winter when I grew tired of stoking the wood stove.

Title: Powerful but heavier
Content:
I had a DevilDirt but it worked poorly on the carpet. So, I bought this Hoover canister vacuum. It is powerful. The bagless drum is easy to clean. 
It does what it is expected. I love it except it is quite heavier. You will get tired after vacuuming the whole house.

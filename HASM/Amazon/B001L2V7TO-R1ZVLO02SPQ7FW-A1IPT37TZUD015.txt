Title: Perfect coffee every time
Content:
I was hunting for a good coffee maker to complement my Bodum french press, since I do not enjoy pressing a pot (And cleaning it up) in the morning.  I can say the Technivorm was definitely the right answer!  The coffee is as good if not better than the press pot (No grounds in the bottom of the cup) and much easier to clean (No grounds in the bottom of the pot!)
This coffee maker does exactly one thing: Make a great cup of coffee.  It brews pretty quickly and is even fun to watch percolate.  I also looked at the thermal carafe version of this maker, however it appears there are gripes with the lip of the thermal carafe (A too wide pour) and the topper design, so I decided basic glass was my friend and so far it absolutely has been!  The one spill I had was entirely my fault, otherwise it fills the cup with no dripping.
I would definitely recommend this coffeemaker to friends who have the money for it and the desire to buy one coffeemaker for life.  It does NOT disappoint!

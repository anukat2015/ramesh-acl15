Title: Stops working mid-brew
Content:
I chose this unit because of the stylish looks and so that I could get percolator style coffee.  I read the instructions and set out to use it.
The manual recommended cleaning the unit twice before using it.  Both times resulted in a watery sludge under the unit.  I didn't submerge it, so why would it do that?  I considered returning it, but because of the hour and the effort, decided to wait until the next day.  It worked the next day without an issue.
Perhaps a week later, the sludge returned. Then it went away.
Within a week, I got hot water instead of coffee!?!  I suspected a thermostat.  I noticed the bottom plastic plate now has a huge crack in it. Tried 2 pots, hot water.  Tried again the next day and it worked....
Now, every other day it's blowing the GFCI circuit in my kitchen. I have to use a thermos to keep coffee hot for a second after brewing.
My best guess is that the thermostat is causing it to overload the circuit or that water somehow got in between the stainless steel and plastic and is causing the short.  Either way, it's terrible design.
I have never been so fired up to write a negative review before. But the hit-or-miss mornings are starting to build up.
I need some coffee...

Title: THIS VACUUM REALLY SUCKS!
Content:
This vacuum is great. Strong suction, excellent build quality and very compact. The wife loves it and claims to like the electrical motor smell that it leaves in the room. I tested it and after doing a small hallway, I was blown away by seeing the debris that my old vacume left behind.

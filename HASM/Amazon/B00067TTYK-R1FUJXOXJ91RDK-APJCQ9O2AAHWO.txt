Title: This is great!
Content:
The Creative Zen Micro is an awesome mp3 player. I have loaded over 900 songs into mine and still have over 1 GB of space left. It is so nice to have so many songs in the palm of my hand without having to carry around all the CD's. The player is easy to use and lets you search for songs based on artist, album, song title, or genre. I simply love it. I recommend it to all of my music loving friends.

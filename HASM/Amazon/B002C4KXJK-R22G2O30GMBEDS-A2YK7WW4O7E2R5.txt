Title: Weight to screen size to cost is excellent
Content:
I purchased this to have a laptop that was easier to carry on trips but still have a usable screen size.  This fits comfortably in my totes including the charger and retractable-cord mouse.  (I'm happy enough with the mouse that I may not get the blue-tooth mouse I was planning.)
I was concerned 13" would be too small, but I'm finding it just fine.  I actually give this a 4 1/2 stars because the keyboard is indeed annoying and the sound not so great.  But the primary purpose of a traveling computer to have ready internet information during trips; answering email and playing solitaire are met very well.

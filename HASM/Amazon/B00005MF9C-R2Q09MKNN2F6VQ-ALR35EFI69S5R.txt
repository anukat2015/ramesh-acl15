Content:
For those of us who have endured year after year of road rage and commuting in the midst of people who seem to be playing superman in the traffic, this neat and affordable coffee maker and travel mug is just what you need to calm you down and help you through the road warrior experience. One look at the stainless steel travel mug assures you it will fit right into that neat plastic device most cars now have, and it saves you from spills and tips that can stain your slacks and spoil your day before you even get to work. The coffee maker itself gives even the most gluttonous of us coffee addicts a great oversized fix of caffeine and is easy to use and clean. Not a bad idea to have one both at home and in your workspace, for the unit is small enough to fit in a desk drawer when not in use, and a convenient way to get that coffee you need even after they have shut down the community coffee maker for the day at 2PM. I don't know about you, but I enjoy a cup on the way home as much as coming in during the morning. At any rate, this is a great product at a great price, and the coffee mug alone is worth the ten-dollar cost of the entire unit. Enjoy!

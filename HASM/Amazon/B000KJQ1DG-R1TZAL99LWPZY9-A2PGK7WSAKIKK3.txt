Title: First SLR, as Easy to use as P&S, but much better output.
Content:
This is my first SLR.  Did alot of comparison shopping between D40 and Rebel XT.  My main reason for choosing the D40 over the XT was the size of the LCD screen on the XT was just too small for me.
Just finished taking over 300 shots on a trip to the Carribean.  Very pleased with the output and ease of use.

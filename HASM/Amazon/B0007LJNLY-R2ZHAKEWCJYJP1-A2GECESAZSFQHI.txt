Title: Pleased so far...
Content:
I ordered two of these units and received them today (one week earlier than expected). I was anticipating some scratches and dents but there was only one very small dent on each unit. Unless you were looking for it, you would never know it was there. I assembled the casters and proceeded to test each unit out. The first unit made some pinging noises as it heated up but eventually went away. The temperature in that particular room (family room) increased 6-7 degrees within 45 minutes. I was impressed. The second unit tested out the same with the exception of the lack of the pinging noise. So far I am very pleased but I am still a little skeptical knowing that there were refurbished. The one year warranty does in fact give me more peace of mind. I would recommend these units to all. The savings was incredible and the shipping was free (other units were $25.00 for shipping).

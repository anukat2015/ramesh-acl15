Title: Bought for a gift, may have to buy myself one.
Content:
I bought the coffee maker for my 91 year old mother. It is hard to find one of these in the stores. I was surprised at how quicly I received the item.  My Mom loves this coffee maker and has convinced me I need one too. I think she may be right. It does exactly what it states on the box, is a perfect size for a small kitchen and gets the job done.

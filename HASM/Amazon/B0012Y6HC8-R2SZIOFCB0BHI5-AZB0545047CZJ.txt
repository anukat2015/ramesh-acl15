Title: Great camera, but never received from Amazon
Content:
Well, I originally ordered the camera through Amazon on the 11th of Sept., it was scheduled for delivery on the 22nd. October 2nd comes and still without the unit, carrier (USPS) showed item was in "arrival scan" status at a location the whole time. Contacted Amazon to cancel order and refund, it's now the 12th of Oct. and still no camera or refund on account. I ended up ordering the camera from n*w*gg for about $50 cheaper, just so happens they had a promo going on, 10% off all DSLR's.
My rating above is not for the service, but for the camera.
On to the product, I love the camera so far. I am just getting into photos, so my photo skills are not quite up to par. Using this camera makes taking photos a snap and they come out great. Quick response to capture those precious moments of your first child.

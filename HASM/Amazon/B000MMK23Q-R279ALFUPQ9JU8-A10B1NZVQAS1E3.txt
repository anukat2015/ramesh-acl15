Title: Comfort and Safety vs. Expense...Hmmm
Content:
We moved to New Mexico from Florida for a couple of years and were thrown into shock because all of the adjustments we had to make. The biggest were 0% humidity (or very little) and a biting desert cold when the winter months arrived. That is when I decided to purchase the Edenpure 1000. We have the one that has the Honeywell thermostat on back. 
I LOVE this heater!
Quickly I noticed the difference in moisture in the house. And the heater took care of a large part of the house (the garage was poorly enclosed and the cold was always there no matter what we did).
Our electric bills during the winter months were outrageous ($400/month) until we switched to the Edenpure. Our bills were less than half of what they were before.
We nurtured our little unit and always made sure to follow the care instructions. The filter on the back cleans real easy and I noticed a difference if not maintained regularly.
It was difficult to part with the money (I was a full-time student) when I had to purchase but the difference in electric bills in the coming months made up for it. 
Another perk is the how safe it is. I have a three-year old. Very safe.
Hands down...this is a Great unit!

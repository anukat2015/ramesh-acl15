Title: Serves my needs perfectly
Content:
I use this in my shop which is in my garage. I place it on one end of my walk around work bench and it supplies all of the heat I need. I live in northern Az with outside air temps down into the mid teens at night in winter. The fan does a good job of circulating the heat. The heater itself does not get hot to the touch and the multi-position feature is a plus. A very good products for my needs.

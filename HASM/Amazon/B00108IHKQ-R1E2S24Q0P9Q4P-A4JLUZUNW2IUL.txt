Title: Good laptop with a bit of false advertising...
Content:
So I read the reviews on here before buying this laptop 3 months ago (thanks!).  I bought it for a long backpacking trip - so I wanted something smaller, with long battery life.  The reviews here said the battery life was not what it advertised, and the screen can be pretty dim - impossible to see outdoors when you're on low power consumption mode.  They were right on both counts.  I would not count on more than 2.5 or 3 hours of battery, even just to type or surf the web, and if you're outdoors, maybe less since you'll have to boost the brightness of the screen.
Other than that, after it's gone through all the start up - and all the preloaded programs, it's reasonably fast and a good size for travel, though I think I'd go even smaller for a trip like this - it's a good balance overall.  The keyboard is very nice, but the keys click when you type, I'm not too crazy about that, and there is no "end", "page up", etc...  which I quite miss.

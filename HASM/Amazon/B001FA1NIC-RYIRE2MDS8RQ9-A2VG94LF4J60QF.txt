Title: I HEART MY FIRST IPOD
Content:
i like this ipod alot.i have an in dash NAVI PIONEER AVIC-X710BT with ipod controls which also lets me voice the artist i want to listen to and tag music from radio,xm,hd radio,etc....so i purchased this just for that reason and not having to keep a bunch of cd's in my car.i like the album art as well.my only grif is the sensitivity when i use it with headphones it goes to quick and is a bit annoying might be because i am not used to it and it stays in the car 90% of the time other than that i like it.i am glad i purchased it will do so again in the future thanks APPLE!

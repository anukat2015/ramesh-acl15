Title: go for the cheaper version
Content:
We really like our vacuum, great suction, but debated at length over the $250 vs $70 cheaper version. The $250 vacuum included the power paw (stair and upholstery attachment) and bare floor attachment. Neither are worth the extra $70. If I had to do it over I would use the bare floor attachment on my other vacuum and buy the power paw separately for $15. It is a cool attachment, just not $70 cool.

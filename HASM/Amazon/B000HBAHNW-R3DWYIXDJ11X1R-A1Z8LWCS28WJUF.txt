Title: Don't buy it
Content:
I too read all the reviews and asked friends, etc. I also got tired of buying a new vacuum every other year. I too valued quality, and was willing to pay more if needed to get it. But, this vacuum needs more than $100 PER YEAR to keep it in bags and filters! Look at some of the package deals - $130+ for 16 bags and one HEPA filter which they say is a year's supply. I have a very clean house, no dirt/spilled breakfast cereal, etc. Mostly dust, no pets.  Dust is what this vacuum does worst. The bags and filters clog with small amount of dust, bathroom powder, etc. Sure it's quiet, but I don't vacuum around sleeping babies (Just the two of us old people). The exhaust blows out the top and into your face when you bend over to turn it on or off. An on/off switch on the handle (like my old Kenmore) would be much easier to use. I'm on my second HEPA filter in 6 months. and I need a new bag every month. The $$$ add up, and you need to take that into account with the overall price. The bag volume is too small. Save your money, or spend it more wisely on something else. I wish I read this review 6 months age and saved $850 and the $130 extra dollars I'm spending at Amazon today for the extra bags and filters I need. Good luck, and keep your credit card handy if you buy this vacuum.

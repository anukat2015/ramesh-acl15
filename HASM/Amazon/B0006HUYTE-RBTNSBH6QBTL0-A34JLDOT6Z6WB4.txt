Electrolux Eureka Sanitaire Commercial Canister Vacuum CleanerI have used this product in other of my offices because it picks up paper clips and has a place for a HEPA filter. This product came with a broken wheel. It is plastic and the plastic tab which held the wheel to the machine was broken. Shoplet sent a Return Authorization promplty, however, the part is $2.50 from Eureka and the box a UPS Store would cost more. Shoplet graciously agreed to accept the vacuum in its entirety but unwilling to simply order the $2.50 part. I ordered myself from Eureka. Seemed like a waist of resources.

Title: quartz heater
Content:
light, very portable, small enough, puts out great amount of heat
for its size, gotta use common sense though, dont get close unless
you want to be crispy cooked (like a pet), heated 12x14 sun room when the furnace
went out, tip-over switch works, conservative on power use - the reason i bought
this is cause i remembered in the 50/60's we had one at home, and like a lot
of things from that time, they worked and lasted a long time - for the price
it's worth it.

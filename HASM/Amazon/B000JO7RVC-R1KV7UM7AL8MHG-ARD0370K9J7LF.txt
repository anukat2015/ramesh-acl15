Title: Love it, hate it, good for music only!
Content:
I am a fully-invested Mac/iPod user, and I thought the great capacity of the 160GB unit could hold a large lossless library plus a bunch of videos to view externally; NOT! 
I love the capacity and am ok with the shortcomings of this being, well, an iPod, but I am very disappointed that Apple crippled the video out port, as I have two dockable accessories that I can't use with this iPod, even with their $50 cable-type "adapter".
This was just a really bad decision by Apple, as it will result in reduced iTunes video/movie/tv show downloads. And why would anyone pay an extra buck for an "HD" episode of a show on iTunes if you can't play it on an external screen? Makes no sense.
This is a strong 4-star unit, in my opinion, without the video out "problem".
The worst part, for me, is that I personalized the back of the thing when I purchased it on Apple's website, so now It's impossible to sell it; be warned!
This could have been a great, all-in-one unit, but Apple unfortunately went backwards with this generation, rendering it a "music-only" type of player.

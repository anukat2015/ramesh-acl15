Title: My Pod Blue is great
Content:
I have a 30g video pod, which is lot of fun for waiting anywhere.  I just watch a video or movie  But I wanted a truly 'traveling iPod".  The toughest part I had was choosing the color.  I ended up with blue b/c I like silver, not the green and figured all the little girls would eat up the pink one.  So I have grown to know and love pod Blue.  I use my iPod mostly for music and Audiobooks,...especially that last one.  I'm a guadance counselor and take many trips on busses with students.  Besides work to get caught up on, I can "read" a book I've been meaning to forever.  There is a small quieting factor in which I dont hear the students quite so loudly and I think we're all happier when we get somewhere.  Right now, I have 25 books on my pod - everything from the Art of War, Zen and the ARt of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Tipping Point, 7 Habits for Highly Successful People and lots of mysteries, current and past.  Check out book titles at wwww.audible.com.  I think this is the invention that has affected a whole world, not just one generation or civilization.  It is an amazing product and has never given my any trouble.  I love it and would buy it again if I had to.

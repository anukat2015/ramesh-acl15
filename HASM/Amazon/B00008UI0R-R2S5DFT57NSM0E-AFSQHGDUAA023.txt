Title: Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Canister
Content:
This is the first canister vac I have purchased in 20 years and I am satisfied with it for the price. I have had Kirby uprights in the past and find the suction on them superior. We recently tore up all the wall to wall carpet and installed oak hardwood and I needed a different vacuum with different attachments. I do find this vacuum better for stairs and I find the adjustable suction handy for area rugs. It is not as heavy to drag around as the Kirbys were and, of course, there is no expense for bags. I live on a farm and have indoor/outdoor pets and it does a good job of picking up hair and tracked-in debris.

Title: Best-kept Secret
Content:
I found this through Amazon. It is the best-kept secret alternative to an Ipod. I bought it for my husband in order to get my Zune back because he kept borrowing it. He LOVES IT. The best thing about it is that there is no need to convert anything. If the screen were bigger, I'd switch from my Zune to the Zen. But my daughter watches movies on the Zune so I can't for now. We also have the cables to hook it up directly through the A/V to the widescreen and watch the movies from the ZEN on the television! How awesome is that? 
He loves the touch pad ability and has decided the touch slide is superior to the click wheel in the ability to control what you are doing. And no more sore thumb! 
Great product. Get one now!

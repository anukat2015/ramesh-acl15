Title: Good for an Area of 1'x1'
Content:
I bought this from Home Depot for $12.59.  I was mainly curious what kind of heat I could get out of a machine that was less that $13.  With the fan set on high, and the temp. at max, this unit heats up about 1' directly in front of the fan, and about 1-2' directly above it.  So, unless you just want to set it on the floor and warm up your feet, I would say use that $13 and put it towards another heater........I will be returning it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will save some people some trouble and now you know what to expect.

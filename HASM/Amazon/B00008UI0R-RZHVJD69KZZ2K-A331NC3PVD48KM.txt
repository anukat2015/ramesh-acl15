Title: This unit works very well
Content:
I decided to buy this vacuum after reading the positive reviews. 
I have had this vacuum for over a year and have had three (3) breakdowns so far. 
Two of the repairs were sent under warranty but the last one we haven't fixed yet since the cost just doesn't seem worth it.  We definitely got a lemon but I don't want to chance buying another one of these. 
When it did work it worked well.  However I'm going for a bagged canister such as a Miele or even an Electrolux (Sebo would be the ultimate).  The bagless feature is nothing but a mess when trying to empty.  
So based on my experience stay away from this machine and invest in something with a better reputation and a better warranty. 
Edit (12/26/07) I found out that the two problems I had with this vacuum were a broken belt and a crushed hose.  This unit works very well and I would recommend anyone to buy it.

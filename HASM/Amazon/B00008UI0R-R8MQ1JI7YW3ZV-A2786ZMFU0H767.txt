Title: FANTANSTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is SUCH A WINNER! Previously I had a vacuum that was compared to the Miele Canister, and it was great..... (but only for 3-4 years....AND IT BECAME PROBLAMATIC)
SO I'M COMING FROM  close to the very best in cansister/vacuums.I wanted to wait a few months before posting this, but I could'nt contain my joy with this cleaner for this review.FABULOUS! IT'S durable & very strong, as I treat my vacuum rather "ruggedly" and expect them to endure, my rigorous movement throughtout the house. It's a tough little machine.!!!
Great power!Compact & light.The tools are easy to interchange. Because it it is bagless,the cannister fills up fast but that's to be expected.And emptying the canister is very easy.If you should be so inclined, you can easilly rinse the filter and and bagless container, with no problems at all. A WONDER MACHINE!!!!!!I HOPE IT LASTS FOREVER!A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT!

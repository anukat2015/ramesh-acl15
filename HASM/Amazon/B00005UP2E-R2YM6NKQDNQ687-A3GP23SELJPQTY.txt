Title: best for the mess
Content:
this might be the best vacuum i've ever owned and i usually go thru one per year. i have children, grandchildren, cats, dogs plus i'm an arts & crafty person. this vacuum needs no bag. you can see how full it is. easy to empty. picks up big pieces of junk with no risk of damaging engine. no belts to snap. very strong. long hose and attachments go to ceiling and ceiling fans. great also for catching bugs. very highly recommend.

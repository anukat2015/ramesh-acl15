Title: Great Heater
Content:
Great Little heater, good Build Quality, unit won't shut off when at set temp . It's just a simple good little heater. It has a thermostat control,   power switch,  auto shut off  if tipped, and forces are from the top and hot air forced to the bottom so you can place the heater against the wall if needed

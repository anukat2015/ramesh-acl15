Title: It Looks Nice, But The Coffee Lacks Taste
Content:
My morning cup of coffee is 12 ounces of Cafe Oquendo Espresso brewed in a stovetop Bialetti stainless moka pot. I bought the percolator for a touch of nostalgia. The water doesn't get hot enough to extract the real flavor of the coffee. My Zia Francesca (everyone calls her Frannie) likes her coffee to look like tea. She would love this Farberware Percolator. It's okay, if you like Folgers or Maxwell House or Butternut, but if you're kinda like me and enjoy a good kick-in-the-pants espresso brew in the morning, this perker ain't for you. Capisca?

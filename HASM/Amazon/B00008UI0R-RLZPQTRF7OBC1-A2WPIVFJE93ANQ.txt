Title: Perfect for hardwood and carpet floors
Content:
I've never written a review before but I spent so much time researching vacuums that I wanted to let others know how much I love my new Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum. I needed something that would work on both hard wood floors and carpeting. I have a Golden Retriever so I vacuum every day to get rid of the dog hair. I don't like using a regular upright vacuum on the hardwood floors because it is slower to maneuver and the uprights don't seem to pick up the dirt as well. On this vacuum, you take the powerhead off and put on the hardwood floor attachment. The suction works great and you can vacuum a large floor quickly. I also like that it has variable speeds. When I'm ready to vacuum the carpets, I just plug the power head back onto the end of the wand and it's ready to go. The vacuum picks up an amazing amount of dirt, it's light weight and it is easy to carry up the stairs. I also like thebagless feature. The last bagless vacuum I had was time consuming and difficult to empty. This one is quite easy. Just take the top off of the dirt container, turn it upside down over the trash, empty it and you're done.

Title: great little vacuumer
Content:
I/ve had The Breeze Vacuumer for 6 years until he died. Could not get it anywhere in Hawaii so searched on tye net and found thos one with free shipping. The price is still good. It is perfect for wooden or bamboo floor and easy goes into every little corner. It is easy to handle and easy to clean. I like not having to buy bags all the time. You might want to go outside when emptying out the canister and filter.

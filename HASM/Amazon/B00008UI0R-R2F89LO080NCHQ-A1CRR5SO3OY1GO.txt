Title: JUNK
Content:
I owned this vacuume cleaner for about 2 months and hated it every time I used it I finally sent it back to buy a Dyson.  It had great suction on hard floors but as soon as it hit carperting and you turned the brushes on they would quit spinning. I would have to hold the vacuume up a little so the brushes could spin and actually pick up dirt and pet hair but it took a toll on my back and a vacuume cleaner should not be that difficult to operate.  If the filters were not cleaned every time the canister was emptied it would lose a noticeable amount of suction.  I read many reviews about this product before I spent $250.00 on it and all the reviews were great until I bought it and now I am so glad I sent it back.  It was a total waste of money and my time even using the vacuume.

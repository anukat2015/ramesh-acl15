Title: OK, but I'd probably buy something else
Content:
I've had this player for about three months now so I can safely write a review.  
First the good: I got this primarily to use with Rhapsody To Go (there was a $100 rebate if you purchased this player and got a subscription), after a few initial hiccups everything worked fine.  The unit has frozen up on me several times but I just let the battery go dead or reboot attached via USB to my computer and everything works again.  The FM radio feature is nice to have and works fine as well.
Now the ugly: There are some features in here that are simply unnecessary, such as the picture viewer (who wants to look at pictures in a 1.5 x 1.5 inch screen?), the text reader (see previous comment), and the digital recorder.  AM radio and or Satellite radio capability would be better than any of this stuff.  It's also annoying that there is no way to play one song by itself - that is, if you browse your way to a particular song, it automatically plays the next song on the album or playlist it is a part of.  Many times you just want to hear one song, so it is really annoying that they didn't think of this.  Finally, you cannot hook up to a computer via a standard USB cable but rather only through their proprietary cable, same for hooking up to a power source.  Ergo, if your cord is lost or busted your are up the creek without a paddle unless you order another one.  What worries me is the prospect of iRiver going out of business and then I will be unable to order a new cord and will be stuck with a $200 purchase that does me absolutely no good.
All said, it's not a bad player but if I had to do it over again I probably would have purchased something else.

Title: Sound - fan noise
Content:
Hi 
I ordered this notebook via amazon and am really troubled by the noise that comes when the machine is running. It is much higher than a 2 year old SONY VIAO that I have...
In a quiet room, this noise is really irritating and I do not expect this from a top line model..
Hope this is an issue with this machine as opposed to an issue with all HP HDX...am getting it replaced...

Title: Great laptop or netbook
Content:
I bought this product because of the great reviews I had read about it. I initially was looking at the HP dm3 and the Acer time-line, but I read great things about this laptop, and some bad things about the HP, and I hate Acer. I bought this laptop because it is a bit bigger than the standard netbook and it has a tremendous battery life. I was planning to use it as just a net book, but I have been surprised to find that it can do almost everything that my 18" laptop can do. I have had this product for about a week, and I have wiped off the bloat ware that came with it, and installed all the programs that I need for work and school, and have been very surprised by the performance of this machine. The battery life is outstanding and I have had absolutely no problems with this computer at all. The advertised 10-12 hrs is a bit unrealistic, but I have been able to average about 7-9 hrs of work using Office, surfing the web and streaming videos. I have not played any games, but I have watched hi res movies and streamed plenty of video, and it works like a champ. The wifi gets great reception, even better than my 18" 2000$ laptop does, and I keep finding more things to love about this laptop. Overall I would defiantly recommend this laptop to anyone, for basically anything except running it as a full time gaming machine, and I have not found really anything that I can list as a con about this machine.

Title: Unit works but window kit, exhaust hose have issues
Content:
I bought this air conditioner for a small bedroom, but was unable to install it due to the exhaust hose being too short. At 49" the exhaust hose is too short for any window that is more than about 3' above the floor. 
I set the unit up in a larger room with a lower window, and it has cooled the area from about 86F to 78F, making it livable, although it is not able to cool the room to 75F as I had hoped. The room is close to the maximum of 425 sq. ft. 
In my opinion the exhaust hose should be longer. Also, the window kit is almost useless. The window kit is supposed to work for windows between 20" and 38", but due to the design you have to cut the PVC in order to get it to fit if the window is between 20" and 28", as the grill gets in the way of the panels. I don't happen to have a power saw so I am having to use cardboard, which is not really satisfactory. 
In conclusion, this product has promise, but I would not recommend it unless you are handy with tools to customize the window kit.
Edit: After using this unit for a couple months, I am happy with it's ability to cool the room. However, I have noticed that it sometimes starts to rattle, especially when it's on the fan cycle of cooling. Pressing or banging on the control panel stops it for a while.  
I was hoping I could use a longer exhaust hose, but I contacted Edgestar and they advise not to use a longer exhaust hose as it may damage the unit, but to place air conditioner on a raised platform. Still trying to figure out what I could use to raise it.

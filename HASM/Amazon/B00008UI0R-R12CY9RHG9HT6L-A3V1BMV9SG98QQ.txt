Title: Please Find Something Else!!!
Content:
I truly hate this vacuum that my husband bought because it looked 'cool' while it worked on both carpet and hardwood floor.
Here is a short list of why:
1.  The belt that rotates the brush keeps slipping off.  After 10th time, my husband threw his hands up in utter defeat. 
2.  I have difficult time dragging the canister part while vacuuming.  So many times, you are limited to the length of the flex hose connecting the two parts.  It gets frustrating after third time stopping to drag/carry the canister.
3.  The main brush/vacuum part doesn't stand on its own.  So when I stop to bring the canister closer, I have to place it on the floor.  My back gets a lot of workout for the day.  
For the most part, the vacuum stays in the closet because I dread using it.  My cordless vacuum has been overworking for our family with couple of dogs and a toddler for now.  If you are considering buying this, please go to your local store so if it doesn't work out for you, too, you can easily return the product.

Title: A design disaster
Content:
This lasted one day.  The pour spout on the carafe has a flat spout that causes the coffee to splash everywhere when it is poured into [and around] a cup.  Consequently, the cup must be placed in the sink to catch the splashes otherwise the coffee splashes would be all over your floor and counter.  Worse yet, the tiny spring that should stop the brewing coffee from dripping when you pull out the carafe, simply fell out of the basket the first time I emptied the filter into the garbage can.  With the cheap plastic stopper gone, there is no way to get a cup of coffee until the whole basket has been completely brewed.  Unluckily. I threw away the receipt because this model replaced a previous adequate model and I assumed this model would be of comparable quality.  FORGET THIS PRODUCT!!!!

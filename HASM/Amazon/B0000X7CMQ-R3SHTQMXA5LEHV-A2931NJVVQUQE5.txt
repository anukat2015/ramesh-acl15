Title: Look No Further!  This is it!
Content:
This is the best coffee maker we've ever owned.  I waited a year to review it, just in case it had some kind of quirky problem like so many others we've owned. 
1.) It makes coffee.  (Don't laugh.)
2.) It's programmable, and you don't need a degree in engineering to do it.
3.) The clock, which as an A.M. and P.M. is also easily set.
4.) Once made, the coffee remains hot for hours even if person #1 gets up hours before person #2, as long as person #1 puts the lid back on correctly.
5.) It never ever overflows during brewing thereby covering the countertop with a brown mess that soaks into everything and needs to be cleaned up BEFORE going off to work.
Someone out there may not like the way you have to measure the water and pour it in, in order to make the coffee happen, but this is not a deal breaker for most of us who live in the real world.
Get it! It is worth every penny.

Title: Almost Perfect All-In One Media Center
Content:
Pros: Ease of use, Compact design, Massive storage space
Cons: Playback software should have been included, Where's the plug-in charger for the 5-series?  Excellent product, but buyers shouldn't feel like they're being nickle & dimed for things that should come STANDARD with the player.  
Idea for the future:  Two Words-BUNDLE Packages.  If you want to pick up T.V. reception, sell the T.V. Bundle.  You want the DVR functonality, sell the DVR Bundle.  Extended Battery use?  Sell the Battery  Pack Bundle.  We as customers would pay a little extra for the combos instead of buying the player & the docks seperately.  Works for the XBOX 360 & PS3 right?  
One Other Thing:  Pack in the plug-in charger with the 5-series (Which is included with the 7-series).  USB charging with the 5-series while packing in the normal plug in charger with the docks leaves a bad taste in the mouths of your customers.

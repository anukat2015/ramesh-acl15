Title: With so many features, this could be the final DSLR you buy.
Content:
I purchased the D80 with a 18mm-135mm zoom in early 2009.  As a former 35mm professional shooter I was blown away with the features this camera offers for the money.  I may decide to upgrade in the future but there is no rush because this camera is very satisfying for the casual shooting I now do.  I bought it as an entry level DSLR but I can see now that it would satisfy most buyers as their final upgrade.

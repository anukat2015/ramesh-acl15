Title: Good and bad experiences with AP420HS
Content:
I bought two units about a year ago. The first arrived broken. The packaging was in perfect condition but the base of the unit (where excess water collects when AC is running) was cracked. I called the manufacturer, it was no problem getting them on the phone, and they replaced the unit. So, no issues with the company as far as customer service. The second unit shook very badly when the compressor kicked in, so badly that it vibrated my chair 20 feet away and shook the lights in the basement below. The company replaced this unit, too. One replacement has worked very well. The other replacement had its LED display die. Called the company and they send me a new LED unit, which I installed. Over the year I've used the machines (pretty much daily for either heat or cooling), one of the units has started vibrating very badly, just like the unit I replaced. Do the units heat and cool? Absolutely. But the build quality? Not so good. 1 good unit out of 4 isn't impressive. Other points: the unit has two speeds and corresponding noise levels: very high and loud and slightly less high/loud. This is not a quiet unit. I use ear plugs when I'm sleeping and have to turn up the TV. I've had no problem with water leaking from the unit, even running 24 hours a day, so I'm happy with the water evaporation. I installed through the wall rather than using the included window vent, using 4-inch PVC pipe. Would have been nice to get a through the wall install kit with the unit.

Title: Gets way too hot during usage
Content:
A nice-looking laptop, and seems to work OK for the most part, except that the wrist-rest area gets very hot during usage.  I'm not talking about warm, I'm talking hot.  It was so uncomfortable I decided to call tech support and report the problem.  The tech support guy said "they are all like that".  I've never used a laptop that got so hot.
I will also add that when I was going through the personalization features, the Windows Vista explorer would stop responding, and I had to shut it down and restart. This isn't a good sign either, especially since this was supposedly a very powerful machine with the Core 2 Duo processor.  
I called the sales department, and they said I would have to pay to ship the unit back + pay a 15% restocking fee (I have to pay because they don't consider the unit to be faulty).  All that for the priviledge of trying out their machine for less than 24 hours.  So I'm sending it back, and my only hope is to dispute the restocking fee with my credit card.

Title: Longtime Mac fan amazed!
Content:
I have had a Powerbook 3400, Pismo, Ibook G3, Titanium, Powerbook G4 and now this macbook aluminum. This new notebook is the best Apple has ever made, I think. The lines are gorgeous, it's solid as a rock, and the backlit LCD is eye-popping.
I don't miss the lack of a firewire drive, either. I'm lucky, all my stuff is USB2.
The one thing that really sends this box over the top for me, however, is the fact that it has a real graphics card. I can game on my laptop!
I love it. I am so very happy with this laptop and I would absolutely buy it again.

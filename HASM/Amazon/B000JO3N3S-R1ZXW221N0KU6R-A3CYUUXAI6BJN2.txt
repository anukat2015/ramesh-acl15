Title: wrong product
Content:
We were told on the original listing this Ipod was new.  What we received was a refurbished Ipod without the Apple logo.  Very disappointed.  When we went back on to Amazon to look at the product again the listing had changed to a new Ipod that ran $350 vs. the listed "new" ipod for $135.  It was an older model so the low price was not a tip off it was not new.
Bait and switch.
Did receive refund w/o problem.

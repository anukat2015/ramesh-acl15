Title: first canister vacuume
Content:
I always wanted a bagless canister vacuume and did a lot of research on them.  I finally decided on the Hoover bagless bagless windtunnel s3755 canister. I think it works great. I do agree with some of the others who have written reviews on this product that the container you empty does fill up rather quickly. We always had an upright so this does take some getting used to, but I'm sure in time I will be able to use it with ease with some practice. And with two birds and a cat, I will get plenty of practice. My husband on the other hand still likes the upright models. He finds this one awkward, but he's trying. The service we received from Amazon was outstanding. I ordered the vacuume on Thursday, and it arrived the following Tues. That was great. Thanks Amazon.

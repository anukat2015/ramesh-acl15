Title: Good while it lasted
Content:
We bought this heater for our living room to try to avoid using our central gas heating very much this winter.  Our living room is fairly large, and this heater is doing a pretty good job so far.  We closed doors so that it's heating just our living room and kitchen, and it has stayed very comfortable for the most part.  There have been a few nights though where it was a little colder (in the 20s and 30s - we live in Georgia!) and it did seem a little chilly in the room, but not COLD.  We haven't noticed any significant change in our electric bill either, and we run this heater almost 24/7.  Overall, it's a decent heater for keeping our living area comfortable, but if you live in an area that gets very cold, this may or may not work well for you (depending on the area you want to heat and the insulation of your home).

It was nice while it lasted.  We woke up this morning and the heater was off.  We tried everything, and nothing would get it to turn back on - no buttons worked, unplugging it and then plugging it back in didn't work, nothing.  It worked well for the month that we had it, and now it just suddenly died.

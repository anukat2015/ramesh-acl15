Title: great idea, EATS BATTERIES
Content:
I found the Sansa Shaker to be a great way for my child to enjoy his music on the fly. The only down fall of the Shaker is its battery consumption. A fresh battery lasts less than 1 hr. My son wishes it would last longer. In these times of global awareness I think there must be a more sesnible solution. My son (8 yrs. old) suggest copying the built in rechargeable battery technology found in Ipod, Zune and many others. I could not agree with him more. I don't feel the makers of this product were concidering the environmental or economic impact of batteries when this product was designed. Although this product costs conciderably less that the Ipod, it will cost you more in the end. Consider this: If your child uses this product for 2 hours a week (about 2 albums of music) you could have bought 4 gig Ipod for what you will spend in batteries and Ipods hold A LOT more music and have built in batteries. Furthermore, batteries are one of the most environmentally poisonious consumer waste products. In addition, batteries are potentially harmful, poisonious to humans. The warning clearly states to " KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN ". So, why design a product for use by children in 2007 that needs a battery every 40 minutes or so? ...I truly do feel that the idea and basic function of this product are brilliant but, not very well thought out.

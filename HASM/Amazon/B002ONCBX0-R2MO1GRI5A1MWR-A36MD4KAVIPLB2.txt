Title: Nice Laptop - Actually has Decent Graphics
Content:
The kicker for me with this laptop is that it actually has a decent video card.  You're not going to be playing any demanding games with it, but for working with HD video it works quite well.  
If you need a laptop that is capable of doing more than internet and office apps, this would be a wise choice.  A couple of things that make it stand out from other 'budget' laptops (this may cost a little more than most budget laptops, but the differences are well worth it in my opinion).
- The P7450 processor has a 1066 MHz FSB, whereas most of the cheaper laptop processors (6000 line) are 866 MHz.  This equates to better data transfer.
- The 4gb of ddr3 ram is faster and more efficient than traditional ddr2 ram.
- As mentioned earlier, the HD4650 video card with 1 gb dedicated memory actually makes the laptop usable for lower end games and HD video.  This also frees up some RAM that would normally be used for any on-screen graphical display/videos.
- The 500gb hard drive is 7200 RPM vs the common 5400 RPM speed.  This will also provide faster access data
All of these items listed help increase the performance of the laptop.  Throw in Win7 x64 and this machine can fly.  I can't comment on the camera or sound as I have not used those features yet, but overall I would highly recommend this machine, possibly as a lower end desktop replacement.

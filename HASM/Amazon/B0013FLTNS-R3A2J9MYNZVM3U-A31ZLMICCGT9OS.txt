Title: I love my Mac!
Content:
I have used a PC all my life until I went away to college this past year.  I was hesitant at first to get one, but it was one of the best choices I've ever made.  It is very easy to use, is visually pleasing, and is very fast.  The only downside I can think of is the battery life.  I've had my laptop for about a year now and the battery doesn't last for more than 5 minutes.  When I first bought the laptop however, it lasted for around 2 to 3 hours (depending on what I was doing on the computer).

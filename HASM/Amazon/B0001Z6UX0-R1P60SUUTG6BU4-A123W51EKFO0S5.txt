Title: Parts Missing & DeLonghi No Help
Content:
After ordering 2 HR715's with missing legs, missing owners manuals, and missing warranty cards I have given up.  I contacted DeLonghi Customer Service and they advised the product was 'new' and parts were not available, "sorry".  Needless to say, I am looking for a heater other than DeLonghi.

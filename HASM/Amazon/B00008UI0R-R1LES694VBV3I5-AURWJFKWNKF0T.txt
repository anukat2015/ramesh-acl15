Title: Buy Another
Content:
I just recieved the hoover bagless vacuum and I am very disappointed, my wheels squeek already(started after 1 week) and the bagless tank holds very little dirt so it must be cleaned after every use. It also gets away from you, so you have very little control over the vacum while on carpet.  My suggestion get a different vacuum.

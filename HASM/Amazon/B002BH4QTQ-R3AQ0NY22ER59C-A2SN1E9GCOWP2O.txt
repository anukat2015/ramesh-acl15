Title: Excellent although phased out
Content:
Purchased this laptop but did not know it was being phased out. I prefer to purchase items at the beginning of the life cycle. However, this laptop has been a pleasant surprise. Excellent battery (it's large enough), excellent DDR3 1GB graphics memory and excellent keyboard with number pad. Purchased for specs not looks but looks nice yet it is just a tad bit on the girly side. Pleased with this laptop over my DV5-1140US which I gave to my wife and she loves it. Glad I purchased this machine.

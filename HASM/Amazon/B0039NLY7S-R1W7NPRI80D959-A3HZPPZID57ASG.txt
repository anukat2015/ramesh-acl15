Title: Lenovo Seriously?!?!?!

I take this thing out of the box and start it up. The mouse pad sucks. I can't even use the laptop in the current condition as it keeps freezing. Nice. So I cannot do anything with it as it is just loaded down with bloatware. I boot into safe mode and got rid of McAfee. I am making progress. I can do some things now. I boot back into windows 7, ok mouse pad still sucks but at least now I can get the uninstall programs to finally come up after 10 more minutes. I start to uninstall some more apps, and things are slowly getting better. Mouse pad still sucks and this laptop is pissing me off more and more by the minute and I just spent 3 hours trying to get this NEW laptop working. I received this laptop today on Friday and I am sending this thing back ASAP on Monday!!!! Seriously, how are they selling this thing??? If you want some advice on this thing, DON'T BUY IT!!!! I bought this to replace an old Gateway laptop that my wife has destroyed over the years by spilling on it and dropping it. Guess what, that hunk of junk is faster than that Lenovo I bought with a core i5?!?!?!?!? Crazy isn't it!!!!! How can you screw this up??? Honestly, you have to just plain be dumb to be able to screw up building a machine with a core i5 and have it be slower than a 5yr old beaten Gateway laptop.

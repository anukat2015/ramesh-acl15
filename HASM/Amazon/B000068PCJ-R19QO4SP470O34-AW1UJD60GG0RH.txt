Title: Quits Working
Content:
I have owned mine for 5 months. The power head quit working 1.5 months ago, I sent it in for a warranty replacement when it quit. They agree the part is bad but the part is backordered. 
The extension tubes use very lightweight plastic where they enter the fitting and it breaks easily. 
The vacuum cleans very well, but do not expect it to work for very long, and expect the warranty to be worthless. Buy a different brand and save yourself a lot of grief.

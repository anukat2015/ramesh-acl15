Title: Best bang for the buck right now!
Content:
I got this camera in sept and have taken around 3000 photos thus far , no complaints it functions in all situations very well. It is on the small side thats my only gripe  so i got the battery grip  but results speak for themselves i have posted a couple  sample shots.

Title: It heats somewhat satisfactory .. blast a fan at it (4 stars)
Content:
Dont like what i see. Its doing a poorer job than my delonghi oscillating ceramic heater. 
I think its not measuring the room temperature a few feet away from it (dont think it can :/ ). So maybe this heater will perform well if the room has good air circulation. Gonna place a fan blasting cold air at this heater to see if that will speed up the room heating process. 
Then i will update.
Yes, also the correct instructions for thermostat is available not on the user manual, but on a sticker on the back of the device.

EDIT: I kept blasting a fan at it to make the air move around it and it is heating my room quite well. Didnt yet get a chance to test it like this on a snowy day, but i think it will keep the room warm.

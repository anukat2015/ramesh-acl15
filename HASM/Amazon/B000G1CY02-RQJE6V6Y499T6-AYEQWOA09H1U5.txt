Title: Excellent heater!!!
Content:
We bought two of these little workhorses and love them!  We keep them on high and the thermostat on med-high at all times.  We live in Northern MI and our furnace doesn't come on so our gas bill will be lower this month and our electricity bill only went up $40!  We have a small 1100 sq ft house and keep the heaters in our living room and dining/kitchen area during the day and then point one down the hall during the night.  They are quiet and they work better than the ones with a fan!  We're going to buy one more for the bedroom areas.  We have the first two on the rollers and plan to mount the new one on the wall.

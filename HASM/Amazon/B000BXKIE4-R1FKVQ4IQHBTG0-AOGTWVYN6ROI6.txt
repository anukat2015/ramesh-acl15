Title: A quiet little sucker
Content:
I bought the 7020B and really like the suction and portability. I have had no problems with it.
The good aspects:
*great suction on low pile carpets and floors.
*QUIET
* light weight & easily portable/maneuverable
* controls on the handle, long cord, long wand
The downsides:
* doesn't work well on shag carpets; not all the attachments are on-board
* pricey bags

Title: Love the Keurig B40
Content:
I received the Keurig B40 for Christmas and love it.  I had done a lot of research and read reviews on this site, which were very helpful.  I bought extra bold coffee so I could use the larger mug size and the coffee comes out great.  With regular strength coffee I have to use the small mug size.  The unit is not noisy and does not vibrate all over the place...some comments I had read about it.
Quick, easy and delicious.  Can't go wrong.

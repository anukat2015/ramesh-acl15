Title: Good unless it stops working
Content:
I bought this vacuum last year and yes, it was the vacuum of my dreams. Easy to use and very effective. BUT I made the mistake of leaving it plugged in overnight. I came home from work to find that it had stopped working. I  realized that it is not made by Electorlux but by Eureka and got it to the correct repair shop, where it has been for the last 3 months. Seems they are still waiting for a part.
What I was told is NOT to leave these plugged in. There is a product defect in the power wand that caused these to short out.
Think hard before choosing this vacuum.

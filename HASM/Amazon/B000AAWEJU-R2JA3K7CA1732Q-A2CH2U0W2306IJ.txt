Title: LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
Content:
I have always been on a search for the perfect vaccuum. I have terrible allergies as do my kids. I have a Dyson and it drives me crazy. It left the floors feeling gritty and dusty. I have 85% wood flooring in my house and I would vaccuum and swiffer daily. This Miele sucks up EVERYTHING! The floors are smooth and it transitions easily from wood to carpet. The only con is that the cord is shorter than most but a small price to pay.

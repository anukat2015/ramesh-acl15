Title: Leaks!
Content:
I have the profuse leaking whenever we use it. Have to use a cookie tray to keep it off the granite countertop. Would NOT recommend. I am going back to a sidearm expresso maker, easier to adjust. Nothing special and nothing you couldn't spend half to do what it does with easier cleaning. You need to disassemble immediately and rinse after frothing milk or it will stay a mess. Sending it to OH for repairs at my cost for shipping but under warranty. We'll see how that goes.

Well when I first recieved this heater, it began to make a strange noise, and there was little to no flame out front, but the flame was in the tubes in the back, and they were getting red hot, and I knew that wasn't right, so I contacted Mr. Heater, and they agreed, that the unit was defective, and they sent a call tag, and it took almost 2 weeks for them to check out my heater, and send out a new one. Normally I would have been mad if it took 2 weeks, but it was right in the middle of the last snowstorm, and they said they were very busy, which was very believeable.  Once I recieved the new heater, it worked fine, and puts out much more head than my previous single burner

Title: Canon Rebel XSi was the Best investment I have ever made.
Content:
I did a lot of research on dslr's and everyone professional photographer that I spoke to said the the Canon Rebel was the best dslr for a beginner. I did buy the book Canon Rebel DSLR for Dummies and was able to whip thru it very quickly. It really helped me to understand all of the features. I would highly recommend this camera for any beginner and even those with professional knowledge.

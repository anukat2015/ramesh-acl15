Title: Smooth!
Content:
The woman that helps me clean my house asked me to get a vacuum like this because it took her very long to clean all our hardwood floors, we have them throughout the house.I did some research and found this to be one of the best. When I received it and put it together I could already feel the high quality of the pieces and when I tested it it almost made me think I could just do all the cleaning myself, it is so potent yet lightweight and its just easy to take up and down stairs around corners. It is excellent for the hardwoods and I also use it on furnichure to get rid of my dogs hair. I am very satisfied with it!...I still have the lady come and clean my house but that extra time can go to do other chores around the house! well worth the money.

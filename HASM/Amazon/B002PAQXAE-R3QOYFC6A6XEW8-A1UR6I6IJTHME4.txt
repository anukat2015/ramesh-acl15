Title: all i ever needed...
Content:
netbooks scared me a bit - seemed underpowered, but i still needed the flexibility offered by smaller size.  this ul20a is perfect.  just over 3 lbs, and i added an extra 2 gig memory unit the day it arrived - which was 6 weeks ago.  performs to all expectations, and am now quite an asus fan! also find windows7 to be a quality product.  some software is not ready for 64bit, but that should continue to change.
so, GREAT graphics, good sound for its size, GREAT speed, fair battery life (dependent on power saving mode) and VERY attractive - strongly recommend!

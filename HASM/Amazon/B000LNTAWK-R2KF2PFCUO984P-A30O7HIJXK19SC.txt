Title: At these prices, EXCELLENT for the non-professional burgeoning artist
Content:
I have being contemplating jumping into the semi-pro/pro body realm since I outgrew my D40x a year ago, but the prices have been unrealistically high.
The D200, though using nearly 4-year old technology, has been a staple for many Nikonians until the D300 was release in 2007; but I never felt that the enhanced AF abilities and ISO capabilities were justifying the extraordinary $1699 price tag of the D300 versus the D200!  So I made the jump when a price drop happened, got the D200 for $599 NEW from a competitor online.
You can't compare the processing speed or 3D AF of the D300 to the D200, completely blow the socks off of this nearly 4 year old body.
But if you are a beginner like me and would like a semi-pro/pro body that has ALL of the functions and customizations you could ever think of, this is your time to jump in on a discontinued body.  You could get a D90 for $300 more, but that will soon be outdated by the D400, and after testing out the D5000, I am sure the next in this semi-pro/pro series will be AWESOME; however, are you willing to pay the premium for new technology?
In short,
CONS:
The D200 isn't usable without a flash above ISO 1000 (maybe 1250)
The viewfinder isn't 100%
Theere aren't dual CF slots
PROS:
At the current prices, this slaughters the D90/D40/D60 series for ability to have ALL controls at hand, infinite customization, exapansive information in the viewfinder, unparalleled weather sealing, and backward compatibility to lenses dating to the 1960's.
Looks cooler than the other D90/D40/D60 series in size, weight, grip, and dimension
All in all, this body will teach you how to be an excellent photographer and show you your flaws faster than the newer non pro-models ever could.
Happy shooting!

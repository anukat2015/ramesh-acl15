Title: Great little mp3 player
Content:
The sound is terrific on this mp3 player although I should say I did upgrade the ear buds I use as the ones that came with the player didn't fit well. It works well with windows media player so downloading music and podcasts is easy. The menu system works well and the battery life is impressive. All in all I'm quite pleased with my purchase.

Title: Good Player for the money
Content:
This is a good mp3/mp4 player for the money. The unit operates very well. 
Pros: Very reasonably priced. Works as advertised. 4 Gigs of storage is probably sufficient for most people although there is an sd card slot for those who need more. Great customer support.
 
Cons: The colors on the display is a little hard for me to read but probably because of the 2.8" screen size.  The FM radio doesn't receive very many stations in my area. The touch screen sometimes has a delay after selections.

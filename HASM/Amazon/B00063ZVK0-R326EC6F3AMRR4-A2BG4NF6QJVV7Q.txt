Content:
I bought a Vornado heater at the local hardware store, brought it home and realized it wasn't digital - so I returned it before opening the box and ordered the digital version from Amazon.  With free shipping I thought it would be shipped on "the slow boat to China" - then to Alaska....I was surprised to receive the heater 3 days later via Priority mail !!!!
Plugged it in and it is true to its word, the room was toasty warm in no time.  I just ordered another of the same Vornado since where we live electricity is by far cheaper than heating with oil.  It's amazing the amount of heat that comes from this lightweight lil guy, but a word to the wise: the instructions say not to put it on a shelf or desk - only on the floor...I'm glad I read the instructions.
Bravo and many thanks Amazon dot com!!!

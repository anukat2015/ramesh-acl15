Title: Worst coffee maker I've ever owned
Content:
We were excited to receive this coffee maker as a gift, but after one week, I'm getting rid of it.  True, the clean up is a hassle, but if it brewed a decent cup of coffee, I would be willing to live with it.  The coffee consistently gets stuck in the grinder and  leaves you with a weak, tasteless batch of coffee.  Save your money!

Title: Best deal in an MP3 player
Content:
Not only is this the BEST deal for an MP3 player, the sound is SOOOO SUPERIOR to any IPOD model. It's small, VERY EASY to load music on to it, easy to use, and just a joy to own. I feel so smug that my music sounds so much better, richer and fuller than my husband's IPOD, and daughter's IPODs and they spent a FORTUNE on their IPODs. I did buy some better ear buds than the ones that came with it, only because I have very small ears and the ones that came with it were too big for my ears. I bought some noise cancelling ear buds and now I am in Heaven when I listen to my little compact Clip+. I even paid more for mine because I bought it directly from SanDisk before they sold them anywhere else. The price here on Amazon can't be beat. But honestly, I am so pleased with this 8GB SanDisk Sansa Clip+, I'd pay double for it now.

Title: Excellent high ISO noise performance
Content:
I get wonderful results at high sensitivity ISO 6,400. It is great for avoiding the use of flash. With Pentax K-x I can get much more natural looking shots in pretty dim light and that's what I was looking for.
Another great features I found impressive for this affordable camera: shutter speed's range from 1/6,000 - 30 seconds (and a bulb mode); burst shooting mode at 4.6 fps; relatively small size (in comparison with other digital SLRs).
I would highly recommend Pentax K-x.

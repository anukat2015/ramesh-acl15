Title: not happy with battery
Content:
I bought a brand new Compaq Presario CQ60 in June 2009 from Best Buy. The overall performance is good. Only the battery is below average. Under regularly usage (surf internet, e-mails, watching dvd etc), the battery seems only last for 60-70 minutes. Considering getting a second battery.

Title: I Love This Camera!
Content:
Bought this right after Christmas, when Santa decided I had been good, but not good enough for this kind of cash.
Let's face it, $800 is serious coin for most of us, and there are hundreds of cheaper cameras out there.
So why plunk down this kind of money for a camera?  Well, it depends on who you are, and what you plan to use it for.  If you are looking for a point-and-shoot for snapshots, you should probably pass.  There are cheaper cameras out there (Canon Powershots, for example) that will give you what you want for less.
However, if you are a semi-serious photographer, this is an extremely nice camera.  I'll skip the tech specs, as you can find those elsewhere.  Here's what counts for me:  the shots are ultra-crisp, and the camera features are phenomenal.  There are enough MPs here to do some significant enlargements, without loss of clarity.
I'd rate myself an enthusiastic amateur photographer, and, in all honesty, this is probably too much camera for me.  Which is good, as I'll be buying a manual, and working to get everything out of this camera I can.  I am using this as an educational tool.  I'll experiment with it, and learn more by using it.
In my mind, well worth the price.

Title: PIECE OF JUNK SAVE YOUR MONEY
Content:
I was shocked at how useless this thing was. I would turn this unit on immediately when I come home from work. The initial reading on the unit would say something like 95% (house was all closed up). The unit could not even drop the room temperature below 90%. After about 1hr the exhaust hose would radiate so much heat into the room that the unit made a better heater than air conditioner. The vents blow upwards as if to cool the ceiling. You cannot adjust them vertically. The unit is also very loud. 
I returned the unit after giving it a try for about 3 weeks. The other pain is returning this. You have to put it back in the box it came in with all the paper work and then carry this 85 pound box to a fedex place to have it shipped back to the manufacturer. You have to pay shipping to send it back and you are not refunded that amount. Plus there is a 6% restocking fee.
Good riddance.

Title: Simply Amazing...
Content:
I've had this I-Pod for about 6 months now and I could not be any more pleased...I've heard some people complaining about the slightest motion changing songs and the only thing I can say is that that has never happened to me before. The keypad sometimes sticks but it's only temporary and nothing to worry about. I know that with my 2nd generation I-Pod classic with video the battery wouldn't last and the I-Pod would restart automatically, leaving me with an almost dead I-Pod...well, this has not happened with this one once so I'm very satisfied!

Title: Good, Solid Camera, trouble with low light
Content:
I have owned this camera for 18 months or so, and have used it in a variety of settings, indoor, outdoor, sunny, low light, action, stills, portraits, etc. It absolutely excels when there is enough light. Beautiful pictures, quick focus, solidly made, excellent camera. 
The problem I have is with low light situations. Not dark, but something less than bright sun. This camera has significant trouble focusing if the subject isn't well lit. Since I bought this camera to take action shots of my son's wrestling team (think about how poorly lit gyms are for taking pictures) and playing football (Friday night lights aren't always so bright), it has been a challenge to get the shots I want. Another problem is that above an ISO sensitivity of 800, the pictures are grainy and ugly, which is pretty much impossible to Phtoshop out, making low-light photography even more difficult. To compensate, I bought a fairly nice 28-200 Tamron for the wrestling mat, which allows me to keep the aperture and ISO relatively low and take some pretty nice pictures with my hot shoe flash (Pentax AF360-FGZ). I also bought the 50-500 "Bigma" from Sigma for football - it doesn't cover the whole field, but as I walk the sidelines, I can get some decent shots while avoiding ISO settings over 800. 
Bottom line: if your main purpose is to take low-light action shots, spend the extra 300-500 on a mid-level Nikon. If you're taking family vacation photos, nature photos, etc., this is a great camera and an excellent value.

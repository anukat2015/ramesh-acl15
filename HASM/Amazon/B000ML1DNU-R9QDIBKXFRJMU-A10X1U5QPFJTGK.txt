Title: Most Awesome Vacuum Ever.
Content:
This may not be a good vacuum cleaner if your home is fully carpeted (the brush head is just plain useless on carpet), but my home has all wood and tile floors.  This is easily the most powerful vacuum I've ever used.
The suction is so fierce, with a new bag you can lift a small child or pet directly off the floor.  Any and all pet hair within a foot of the suction head is sucked directly into it.  
The retract/extend feature of the wand is also handy, because the vacuum is easily stored in a coat closet.  The wand locks into the bottom of the vacuum when it is standing vertically.
Filtration is incredible.  I'll never use a filthy bagless vacuum again.
I'm not a particularly into home cleaning devices, but this vacuum is so bad*ss I just had to review it.

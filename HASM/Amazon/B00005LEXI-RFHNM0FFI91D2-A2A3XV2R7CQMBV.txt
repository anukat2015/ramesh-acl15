Title: Non-vented gas heaters--
Content:
Non-vented gas heaters have a couple of problems.  You usually hear about the danger of carbon monoxide buildup.  I don't know as I've ever had a problem with that, cracking windows when I run either kerosine or propane heaters.But this heater is what for heat I had last winter in a travel trailer.  Running it for a couple of hours gave me lots and lots of condensed water vapor on the windows.  I complained to some neighbors about this, wondering if I had a special problem here.  But they said that they thought that a big heater of the same kind left their floor too damp to walk on barefoot. Bottom line--ventilate, ventilate ventilate.

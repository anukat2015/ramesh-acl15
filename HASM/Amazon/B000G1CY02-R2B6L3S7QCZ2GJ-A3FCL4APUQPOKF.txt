Title: The Best heater for a small room
Content:
This is a great heater. It can heat up my bedroom pretty fast. It has plenty of heating ability. It is totally quiet. You can mount it on your wall if you want. You have to leave it outdoors for the first day because it smells bad. After that it's fine. 
This is the best heater I've ever had. It does not burn up the air and make me cough like those quartz heaters. I used to have a terrible chronic cough from using quartz heaters. I think the retail stores are really stupid for not carrying heaters like this one. Pretty much all they have is quartz heaters and maybe a few oil heaters.
Ignore the negative reviews. I have not had any problems with mine. It looks like a very simple device. I doubt much could go wrong with it.

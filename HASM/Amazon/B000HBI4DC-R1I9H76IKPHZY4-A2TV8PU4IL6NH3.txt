Title: Nice Coffemaker but Not Strong Enough
Content:
This is a nice quality coffeemaker.  It looks good and is easy to operate.  The only problem I've had is that the strongest setting is still weak (if you like coffee about as strong as Starbucks).  As a result, I've had to set it on 10 cups but only add 8 cups of water to get it right.  If I have company and need to have a full pot of 10 I add extra grounds to the the filter to compensate.  It makes me wonder if the grinder adjustment is not working or not grinding finely enough.

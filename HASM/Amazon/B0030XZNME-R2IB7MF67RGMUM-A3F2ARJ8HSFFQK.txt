Title: Awesome!! HP Notebook
Content:
I have only had this laptop for a week and so far it has been working very nicely.  I have always been an HP fan so I love it even more. I love the look and feel.  The graphics is wonderful and the brightview screen enhances the colors.  All the features makes it very exciting to use and I love the fact that it has a built in webcam and wireless network ready.  I have also notice that it is not a noisy machine in which is a plus.....thanks its wonderful!

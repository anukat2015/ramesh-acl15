Title: Impossible to find a filter replacement
Content:
I bought this vac for our fireplace and I was very pleased with it... until I tried to purchase a replacement filter for the vacuum.  Amazon offers several as "often bought together" items, and I have now order two of those.  Unfortunately, neither one has fit the vacuum model, and I have had to go through the headache of contacting the seller and sending the units back.  Meanwhile, the vacuum isn't usable without the filter.   It is totally aggravating that Amazon would list the replacement filters as options when they do not fit at all.  I cannot find a replacement that does work, at least not on Amazon.

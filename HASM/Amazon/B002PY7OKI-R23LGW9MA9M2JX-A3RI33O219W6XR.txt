Title: Good laptop for the price I paid
Content:
I got this laptop during a gold box deal and I am quite pleased with this laptop. I have been using it for like little over a month now and so far have not faced any serious issues. However, the battery life isn't that great. It says 4 hr battery life but it dies within 2 or 2.5 hrs. Secondly, it attracts lot of finger prints because of the glossy finish. Other than these two cons it is a good entry level laptop.

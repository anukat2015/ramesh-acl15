Title: Great suction, but heavy
Content:
We needed to replace an older Bissell which was getting too loud.  I did a lot of research, and concluded that while a $500+ vacuum might last longer, we needed a cheaper alternative.  
We've had the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser for a couple of weeks, and we're very impressed.  It picks up 90% of the dog hair (from one Rhodesian Ridgeback mix) in one pass.  I usually make two passes in different directions, but that's not strictly necessary.  I had my doubts about the pet hair attachment on the front, but it seems to work pretty well.  It does seem a little bit flimsy, so I always flip it up when we store it.
The attachments work well, especially the powered brush (it uses the suction to spin a brush), which is especially useful on the stairs.  The problem is the attachments are difficult to snap into their storage spots, and difficult to get out.  That means I mostly just use the nozzle.
The other downside to the vacuum is that it's very heavy, as vacuums go.  Neither I nor my wife have a problem using it, so the weight is not prohibitive, but it is certainly heavier than any other vacuum I've used.  If that's the price of a motor that's strong enough for pet hair, I'll take it.

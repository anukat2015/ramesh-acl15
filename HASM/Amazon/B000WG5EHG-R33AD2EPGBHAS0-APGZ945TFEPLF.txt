Title: Zune 8GB
Content:
This could very well be a user problem but this zune is complicated. tons of features are on it but only way to know what to do is online in the help area, as you plug in your zune the site will download and be on your desktop for future references.
The head phone jack has a short in it or something and the wire needs to be wiggled around before you can get any sound.
It's very touchy and crashes a lot where you can't get it turned back on.  So far it only holds about a 4 hour charge.
Each time we need to charge it, it needs to be pluged into the computer usb because thats the only wire that came with it. We ordered the ac adapter to remedy this because on vacation we have no computer with us. (another $20.00)
At this time it isn't working at all, plug it into the computer and is not detected, nor will it turn on.  The help site is not helping to fix this problem.
The help site also has a forum where users can post questions and help each other.  This site has a million questions all been visited a thousand times with nearly NO answers from users, they have tons of problems. IF I can get this working properly I'll be happy. So far no luck.  This is not Amazons problem, its the producer of Zune.

Title: Not what it used to be.
Content:
Have a Electrolux canister that is 40 years old. Wanted to get a second vacume bought the EL 7020B Oxy3 because Electrolux was the best money could buy, well no more! After 1 month controls on the handle don't work properly. Cord retractor won't work properly, keeps rolling up cord. The floor brush is too long, not enough vacume power. Hose is starting to show signs of wear. Over all just a crappy vacume. Sears is so much better.

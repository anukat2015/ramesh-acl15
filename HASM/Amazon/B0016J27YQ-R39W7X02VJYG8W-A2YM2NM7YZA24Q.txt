Title: don't expect it to cool like a conventional ac
Content:
Evaporative coolers are best suited for those who live in dry climates and even so, they do not cool as well as conventional air-conditioners.  This portable evaporative cooler is best suited for small rooms when the conventional air conditioner is not adequate or not working properly.  I've been using mine for 2 days now and it is adequate for my needs.  I just overestimated how much cooling it would provide at first.  The HEPA and ion filter makes the air smell clean and fresh which is perfect for people with asthma.

Title: Gets warm but not if you are over 15 inches away
Content:
I bought this at Walmart when an ice storm hit.  We plugged this into our emergency generator and this "Large room" heater is not a "Large room" heater.  Our living room is rather large and the temperature in the room has risen above a very cold 50 to about 64 since we have had this running...  for NINE hours.  nine hours to raise the temp 14 degrees in the room.  I will give this a try in the master bedroom tonight where we have moved our pre-teens in with us until we get full power restored.  May be it will warm up the bedroom.  My only real issue is that this is marketed as a "Large room" heater and it just isn't.  Medium - maybe..  small..  sure.  Wally world had this for $65 and it was the last one.  All the other heaters left over were marketed as small or medium room - so you can see why I am irritated that this didn't perform as expected.

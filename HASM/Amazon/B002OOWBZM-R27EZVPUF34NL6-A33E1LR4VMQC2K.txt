Title: was about to throw it out the window
Content:
At first sight, this laptop is pretty stunning.  Light, compact, thin, sleek.  It is pretty full featured: 3gb ram, 500gb hard drive, wireless n, bluetooth, etc.  However, it has some quirks that really irk me.  As far as Windows 7 goes, I hate having to verify programs over and over, I think the start menu it shares with Vista is clunky and should go back to xp style, but that is an os issue.  Now for my gripes with the hardware:
The speaker issue which has been well addressed in previous reviews so I will not get into it.
Webcam: default not set to night mode so if you are indoors forget about being able to see anything.
Facial Recognition: takes longer if not just as long to type in your password than to use this.
Keyboard: absolute fingerprint magnet
Touchpad issue: this made me want to literally slam it against a wall and return it.  I think I have finally found a good solution to this problem.  I followed the other reviewers instructions as far as deleting the drivers and reinstalling the default drivers.  However, I found this to not fully solve the problem as I got sparatic movement and lost scroll and all functionality.  So I searched and found an updated driver and installed, now I am a happy camper, as long as it stays working.  I still hate the rocker button design, very dumb.  Download the new driver here: [...]
hope I saved someone some headache.

Title: Don't buy this coffee maker
Content:
Let me start saying what's awesome about this coffee maker. There's no burner, so the coffee tastes wonderful till the last drop. The inside is metal and not glass, which means it's easy to clean and you don't have to worry about a glass interior breaking.
Here's the bad. If you use a lot of coffee or finely ground coffee, it doens't drain through fast enough and your counters and floor will wind up full of coffee. I purchased mine in DC and it had problems with esspresso so I don't brew that anymore. I bought it for a relative when I was in CA and for another relative when I was in IN. I feel bad because they have overflow problems worse than I, and they are using grocery store bought Starbucks. One relative sets it in the sink to brew it.
I called Cuisinart to ask them about this problem. I told them the internet has a lot of negative reviews about this coffee maker overflowing. They asked if I was using the plastic filter along with a paper filter....why would I do that? Needless to say it was an aggravating expereince. Cuisinart customer serive is awful!
So, if you use a lot of coffee, I wouldn't recommend this product. Or, buy it from a store so if you do have an overflow problem, you can return it easily.

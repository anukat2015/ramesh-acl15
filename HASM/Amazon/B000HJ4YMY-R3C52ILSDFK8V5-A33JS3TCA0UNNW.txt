Title: Good Camera; Lousy After Sale Service
Content:
I bought a D80 earlier this year.  It performed well enough for me (knowledgable amature level).  However the LCD component broke after two months with no rough handling.  The breakage wasn't covered under warranty as it was judged my fault.  Well whatever, but I'd caution others that the camera is especially fragile.  However my biggest problem is that its been six weeks and Nikon still hasn't provided the necessary part to my repair shop.  The shop is a large high volume one and they say the long delay getting Nikon parts is very common and is why they recommend that people go with another brand, say Canon.  They can't even get a target delivery date out of Nikon.  So beware, if you need repair work you may well be without your Nikon for a long time.

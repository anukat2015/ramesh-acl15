Title: Makes great tasting coffee, but....
Content:
it just doesn't brew it hot enough. Especially for my wife who likes cream in hers. I asked the place I got it from if there is any way to make it hotter. They suggested preheating the carafe. Sort of defeats the purpose of having a programmable coffee maker, IMHO. We do like the carafe though, so we are keeping it as a backup.

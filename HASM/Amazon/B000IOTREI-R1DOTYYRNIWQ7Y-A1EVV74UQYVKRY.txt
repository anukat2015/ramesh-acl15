Title: Great for a Quick Heat or to Warm a Cold Spot
Content:
I work from home and sit at my desk for much of the day. My hands especially get cold if we keep the thermostat where my husband likes it (too cold for me!).
I like to use this heater at my side so that the area around my desk, especially underneath, stays toasty warm. This keeps my entire office warm at the low setting.
It runs quietly and has a tip over alarm. If it is turned on and gets knocked at all, even slightly tipped, it makes a loud alarm sound. Great for cases when a dog or child might knock it over by mistake.
The footlight is good and acts as a reminder that it is turned on and the large grill on the front keeps all heat elements clear from touching anything.
Although I haven't done the research to see if it has saved us money, it must in the long run. The thermostat for the part of our house with my office is in my office. So if my office is warm, the furnace will not come on and I'm not running the furnace for the rest of the house.
I've had other space heaters in the past but this one is the quietest and gives the most uniform heat quickly.
I've had mine for about 4 years now and it has never given me any trouble.

Title: Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater is Quiet
Content:
I purchased two of these heaters, and although the coldest part of the year has passed, these are the quietest heaters I've ever owned. The good and the bad of this is that I have several times forgotten to turn them off when I left whatever room they were in. (Note- I don't need two in one room, I have each in a separate room.) The adjustable thermostat works just as stated and can be set to maintain a constant temperature. I am very pleased with this purchase.

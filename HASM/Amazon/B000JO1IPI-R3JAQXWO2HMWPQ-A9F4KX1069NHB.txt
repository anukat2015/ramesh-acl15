Title: Works Great
Content:
I previously had a little free crappy Napster player that held only thirty songs, so I am in heaven with movies, videos, TV shows, Podcasts, etc. The only negative thing I have noticed is someone mentioned in a review I saw somewhere that sometimes people have noticed some wavy lines goign on when watching the video part. I have determined that this is probaby not the player as it happens to me only with one movie I have downloaded. All my TV shows appear fine on the IPOD 160 GB and other movies appear fine. I have not had any other player from Apple to judge against, but I am a little slow to figure out how to manipulate the scroll wheel and features. I wish ITunes had a broader movie selection, but I can watch tons of TV shows so I am happy. It is so much nicer to travel with a small, compact IPOD rather than large books, portable DVD player, or laptop for entertainment.

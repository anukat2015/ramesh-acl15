Title: Save your money
Content:
Very little to no suction on the dry side.  Wet side had good suction but difficult to push forward making the task more difficult.  Sprayer stopped working after just 2 uses. Since I hate repackaging for returns, the unit is sitting unused in a corner.  I thought I had found the perfect lightweight cleaner but I am still searching.

Title: New to iPod (and Apple) -- not very impressed
Content:
I rarely go with the majority when it comes to acquiring the latest and greatest, but I thought the iPod might be something I really could enjoy. So far, so-so. One of the reasons I was looking for an MP3 player was so I could put all of my audiobooks on one device rather than burn a lot of CDs, but there were a lot of MP3 players I could've gotten for that purpose, and for a lot less money. The sound quality is very good but I've heard better. The CoverFlow is a neat idea, even if it's slow to start moving, but not all of the album covers for the music I have can be found (there's a lot of classical albums out there that apparently aren't as important as the latest pop or R&B). I discovered how to "create" them but it's just not the same as the real thing. Downloading takes forever, or so it seems, and I find myself falling asleep as I wait. Syncing with iTunes can be tricky if the correct boxes are not checked off. I started to panic when I thought that all of my tracks had vanished. I did break down and buy a movie but I think I damaged my eyesight by watching such a small screen! I could go on and on, but let me close by saying maybe I'm just not an iPod person. Perhaps I should've started smaller and purchased a Nano.

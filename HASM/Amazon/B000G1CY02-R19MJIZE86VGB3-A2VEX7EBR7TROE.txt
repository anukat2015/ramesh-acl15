Title: Heats well - akward placement
Content:
I love the heat that this produces, however - it's awkward to try to place it next to a wall, on a corner etc... It works best in an area where there is no traffic. My cats hit the side as they fly by and spin it all the time.
It definitely produces good heat and quickly.

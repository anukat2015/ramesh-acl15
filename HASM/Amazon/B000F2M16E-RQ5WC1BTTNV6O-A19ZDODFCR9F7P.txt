Title: Good for the money
Content:
This is my first mp3 player. I did not want to buy an ipod. 
So I read many reviews,on many brands. Creative Lab came on top.
I will say, the ear buds stink,they could of made some that fit in human ears. 
There is a slight background buzz when the display is lite and only when the volume is very low. 
The battery issue,that many complained about, I have not ran into that problem. From what I have read,it is best to drain down the battery to it being dead for the first 3-5 times. Then charge as needed. 
I installed about 500 songs,and I used only about 30%. Which is not bad.
Accesories is a little hard to come by. I did find on Ebay,a silicone case with a belt clip. That I ordered.  
Overall the size,and weight is great.
For the budget minded. Good for the money

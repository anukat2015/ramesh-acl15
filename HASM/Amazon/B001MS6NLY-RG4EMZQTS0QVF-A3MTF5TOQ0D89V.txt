Title: All good but Vista 64bit sucks
Content:
Pros:
Great display
Full size keyboard
Cons:
Vista 64bit.  Many programs don't work with 64bit.  You have to buy them again for 64bit or they're not even available.
No drivers for XP, so you won't be able to us XP.
Battery life is short, and the power adapter is hot.
Update:
Vista 64bit really sucks.  Lot of trouble with IE 7.  Then upgraded to IE8.  Still problem.  Freeze on many websites.  I really want to use XP, but Sony doesn't have drivers for XP, not even Vista 32bit.

Title: Great heater
Content:
This heater is completely perfect for my needs - a second under-desk heater in an office setting. The wattage is low, so no tripped breakers, and although this heater won't heat the entire room (not meant to!), it does a great job of keeping people comfortable at their desks. It does get hot to the touch, although it's pretty easy to avoid touching it, and unless legs are bare, it wouldn't be a problem. One slightly odd note - I have bought two of these heaters through Amazon in the past few months. The first NewAir AH-400 came from one vendor - great heater, no problems. The second, ordered a few weeks later, came from RedeemAir (currently the vendor for this item), and it's the same model heater, but NOT "NewAir" brand. I can't see any differences other than the brand name, and of course manufacturers provide their goods to multiple companies for branding, so this isn't really a problem, although Amazon should probably consider changing the brand name here on the website.

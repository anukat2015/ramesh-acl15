Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
This is a great mp3 player, especially for the preteen since it has its own speaker and does not need ear buds.  Because it has its own speaker, my wife loves it (we are getting another one for her).  The only down side is the lack of a shuffle play, the random function does jump somewhere in your list of songs, but then continues sequentially from there.  Memory card size is not a problem.  We had an extra sd card from our camera (we went from a 1gig to a 2gig card) and can now switch between them quite easily.  I would recommend rechangable batteries.

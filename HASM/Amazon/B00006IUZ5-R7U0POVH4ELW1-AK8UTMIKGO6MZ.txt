Title: I am in love
Content:
This is an amzing product that I now can't live without.  It makes making one cup of tea unbelievably easy, but it's also convenient for making more cups as well.  I'm a huge tea freak, and I love to offer tea to everyone that comes over, now it's so much easier because I don't have to wait for a huge kettle to boil, I can just heat the water quickly for each cup in the hot shot.  My friends love it too, and I think several are planning on getting one of their own.  By the way, I didn't notice any of the flavor problems that other people have mentiond either, and I'm quite sensitive to taste.  I only use filtered or spring water to make tea, though, so that may be the difference.

Title: "Just a Week"
Content:
Bottom line - it only lasted a week, but while it worked I loved it. Amazon replace it and the new one that does work well. Good quality for music, pictures and video. Use of ease is also a plus. So the one star is the fact that it was not built well for the price paid. 
Another small issue was you guys have a tendency of packaging item at the bottom of the sale, "People who purchased this also bought this" So I did as well and one of those items was the case for the Nano 4th Generation. Well it didn't fit, as all those who ordered it will tell you. Any way I gave up trying to get one that does fit.  E-mailed you and the seller and the best I got was, "We have it now", but the shipping is more then the cost of the case. As a result of the two issues, that should have been on you. 
I do look at you guys a little differently because of the two bad experiences with this one purchase.

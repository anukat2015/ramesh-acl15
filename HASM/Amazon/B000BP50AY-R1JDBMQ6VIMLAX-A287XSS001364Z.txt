Title: Good Player
Content:
Great little player with excellent FM radio on it as well. I did not want to get into the Apple trap or pay what an Ipod costs as well. So I bought this player and have not been disappointed one bit. I use it when I am walking, on the lake fishing, and at work as well. Drops into my shirt pocket and sound is great on it. Controls are simple and easy to use. Recommned this small unit.

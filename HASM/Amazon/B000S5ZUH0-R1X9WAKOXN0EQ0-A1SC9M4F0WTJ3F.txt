Title: great tech support for a great product
Content:
There were some prior reviews saying that tech support was poor. Don't know where they contacted for support, but when I filled out the on line registation at their web site I then got a special tech support user number. I sent an email to them (they do also have call in) and they got back to me within 2 hours with an answer. And it is a bit annoying to have to pay $20 or so to get the internet software and $30 to watch mp4 movies, but even adding all that in it is a super value product. HINT: this unit charges with USB which takes many, many hours. Rather than spending big bucks getting the Archos plugs and docking station check out The Gomadic Rapid Wall AC Travel Charger for the Archos 604 at Amazon, Only $20. Important- call Gomadic first and tell them you want the tip for the 605 unit since the 604 unit will not fit in the 605, but Gomadic told me they have a specail tip they will can send so that it fits in the 605. Gomadic was super helpful on this also

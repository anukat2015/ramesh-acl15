Title: Amazing camera, great shots and terrific features!
Content:
I purchased this camera right before i got my job, and then the job took most of my time, but when I was able to start using the camera, I was VERY impressed!  I prviously had the k100d, but became more advanced in my skills and needed more of a challenge.  I bought the K10d for its advanced settings and options.  The 100 iso is a terrific thing to have during sunny days, the colors and photos are so crisp! I am floored at the way my photos turned out!  Less noise and more distinct color than I have seen.  I highly recommend this camera, it is now my pride and joy, my baby and I become more and more impressed with it every day!  I see no cons as of yet, and I love the option to shake the dust off with the new feature.  I love this camera, and I know you will too!

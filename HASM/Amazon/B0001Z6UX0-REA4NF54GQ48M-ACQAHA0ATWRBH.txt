Title: Great looking, works very well
Content:
We live in a studio apartment so we wanted something that would take the chill out during the spring and fall when the heat doesn't come up.  
Because the studio is relatively small, we also wanted something that looked  good with our eclectic pieces of modern furniture.  
This heater more than fits the bill, and, placed in front of the winterized A/C also kills a nasty draft during the winter months.
It also has a slim profile which facilitates storage during the summer months.
The only (very small) improvement would be if the cord came out of the side opposite the controls, which has as much to do with where it sits in our apartment as anything else.

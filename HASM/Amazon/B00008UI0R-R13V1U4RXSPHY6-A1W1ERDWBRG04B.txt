Title: Best one yet!
Content:
It would seem that I've developed a hate/love relationship with most vacuums.  I bit the bullet and got a Dyson and returned it a week later.  What an awkward machine.  Then I got the WindTunnel Bagless Canister.  I'm really an impressed.  Less than half the price of the Dyson and does just as good of a job and a lot easier to use.  
There are tree humans living in my house and 5 pets.  Two with long fur and three with short.  The windtunnel gets deep down cleaning done.  I will be purchasing an extra dirt cup and filter though so that I don't have to wait for the filter to dry if I feel the urge to do lots and lots of cleaning!

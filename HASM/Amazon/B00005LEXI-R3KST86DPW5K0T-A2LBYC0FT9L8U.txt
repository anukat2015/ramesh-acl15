Title: Great Product
Content:
This heater is excellent and the perfect fit, for a certain set of requirements.If you have electricity, use an electric heater.  Don't bother with the hassel of propane.  The cost isn't too different and the hassel factor is much higher than electricity.I also don't recommend using the small canisters.  That's an inconvinient way to go as well.BUT.  If you don't have power and need a cheap, safe heat source that you can run while you sleep, this is the best one made.  Buy the 12' hose, place a 20lb propane tank outside, and run this heater all night with just a small crack in a window or door (just in case!).  You will get > 100 hours of heat out of a tank of propane!  Less than a buck to run it all night.Highly recommended under the right circumstances.

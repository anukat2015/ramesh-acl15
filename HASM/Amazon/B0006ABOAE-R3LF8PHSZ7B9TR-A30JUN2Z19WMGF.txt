Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
This is the least priced combo coffee/espresso maker on Amazon. It works and does its job, but to a certain extent. You really do get what you pay for. So for the price, I would say it meets expectations. If you're not picky and your priority is cost, then you could say that this could do. But if you really want quality, then go for another one.
Findings:
- When done, the coffee and espresso aren't so hot. They are just warm and not burning hot like McDonald's coffee. So if you make coffee from here, you better drink it fast!
- The steamer part does it's job of frothing coffee, but it doesn't heat it as well either. It runs out of ammo or power too quickly. When you make a latte, you taste the warm espresso on the bottom, but the froth or milk is cold!
- There is no sign or alert to tell you the coffee and/or espresso is done. You have to rely on the naked eye to discern if it has stopped brewing.
- I hate the coffee carafe. The lid doesn't open all the way, making it hard to clean the inside. The lid isn't easily detachable either.

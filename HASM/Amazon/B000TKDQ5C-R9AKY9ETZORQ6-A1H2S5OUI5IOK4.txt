Title: PERFECTION!
Content:
I've gone through about 6 space heaters in the last 4 years. Some over heat, but the most annoying thing to me is when they make a clicking, clink kind of sound which keeps me awake!!!! 
I opened the box, plugged in the Lasko 754200 and VOILA. It is AWESOME! I don't know what people are talking about it being loud for? I mean, it's not whisper quiet...but it's by no means loud. It lulls me to sleep, and it heats up our bedroom nicely on setting 1 !!! Don't even have to use setting 2 (the hottest).  Our bedroom is huge too.  It's the attic of our home which was converted into the master bedroom and it's about 60 x 12 !!  I LOVE the cool setting on it too. It'll make for some comfy nights when summer arrives.
My cats were even basking in front of the heat that it was generating earlier today.  It's stylish, and the buttons are easy to use.  
NO complaints here, and most importantly, NO clicking, clinking noises!! I can sleep with this one one!!
For the price you CANNOT go wrong!!!
I am 150 % satisfied!!
THANKS LASKO and THANKS AMAZON!!

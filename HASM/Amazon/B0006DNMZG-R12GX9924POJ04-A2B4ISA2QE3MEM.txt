Title: Excellent Room Heating Unit
Content:
This little unit heats two of our children's rooms (10x8 and 12x14) perfectly! Their rooms are normally around 63 degrees while the house is at 66, and this unit will elevate them to 75-80 degrees with very little effort. I know because I used an electric thermometer to measure the temperature.
Don't expect this unit to completely heat a room without the presence of a central home heating unit. Meaning, this unit will not heat a small cabinet in the middle of the wood by itself. But if you have central heating (baseboard or central-air) and keep the temperature low to save on gas bills this is a perfect unit! It's made to complement them.
The only thing that I wish it has is a digital thermometer so that I can set it at the exact temperature instead of doing it by feel. But then, it's so inexpensive I can't really complain.

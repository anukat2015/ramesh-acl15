Title: Looks and Efficiency
Content:
I bought this heater for auxiliary heat in a 12x15 bedroom. It is perfect for taking the chill off in the morning, and on a very cold night can be run all night because it is totally quiet as well as having safety features such as tip-over shut off and overheating safety shutoff.
I plugged mine into a remote device so that I can turn it on from my bed a few minutes before getting up!
The slick EuroDesign allows this heater to be used unobtrusively anywhere.
It is lightweight and the wheels attach easily with just a Phillips screwdriver, which allows this heater to be wheeled into just the perfect position nearby. The only drawback is that it is perhaps a bit underpowered. A unit like this which would heat with a touch more "oomph" would be perfection.

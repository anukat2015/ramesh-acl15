Title: When will I receive this?
Content:
I am sure the camera is great but I wish Amazon would deliver it to me first.
I ordered this camera on 30th June but as of August 10, 2006 am still to receive it. Amazon has delayed shipping it 3 times though as I see it, the item is "In Stock".
When I call them the call-center person tells me that it is "Backordered". I wonder who is lying.
Truly great customer service from Amazon!!
PS. The rating of 5 starts is for the camera not the Amazon service. That would be negative...

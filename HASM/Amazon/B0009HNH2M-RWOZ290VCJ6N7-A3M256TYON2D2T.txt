I bought this Hoover b/c I had an old Hoover that worked great for a little over 10 years.  It was sturdy and not flimsy. I also had a Kenmore Progressive that lasted only 6 years of light use.  The hose broke off twice and decided wasn't worth repairing for the second time at $100 a clip.  This new Hoover Duros is very flimsy, just feels cheaply made.  The construction of this is very weak, it has only 2 big wheels so I find that it flips over constantly.  The two attachment pieces are very small and are located on the handle of the vaccuum.  Poor location they fall off constantly, the do not have a secure fit and are located in a spot that easily get knocked.  Also while it does have a rug and floor setting, the sweeper is just too big to get into tight spots (under kitchen table, under cabinets) and the attachment pieces are tiny not meant for floor, but I use one for that anyways b/c the sauction is better on the hardwood or tile.  I would say the sauction is good for the rug, but for the floor using the sweeper it does just an ok job.  Fortunately, I only spent $140 on it vs. $300 for the Kenmore, so I guess it was probably priced right, only 1/2 as good as the Kenmore.  So while I was not pleased with my Kenmore Progressive breaking twice, it is definitely a better more sturdy vaccuum.  I actually miss it.

Title: hot choclate machine
Content:
I got this for my 14 yo daughter for Christmas. It is now April and she still uses it practically every morning.  She loves it.  Cleaning it is a bit of a hassle if you don't soak it immediatley after use.  You can use powder cocoa mix or make your own recipe.  She loves it.  I would recommend it.

Title: B&D Coffee Killer
Content:
This is the worst piece of crap I have ever purchased. First one started malfunctioning within a week and died. Called service and they said to cut the cord off and send it in. Second one lasted almost two weeks and died the same way. Customer Service acted like this has occured a thousand times. I am a woodworker and buy lots of tools. Because of the lack of quality of this machine, I am done with Black and Decker tools. I threw the last one away and didn't even bother with the warranty. I'm out 30 bucks, but a lesson well learned. My new Kuerig works fantastic. Senseos are also good.

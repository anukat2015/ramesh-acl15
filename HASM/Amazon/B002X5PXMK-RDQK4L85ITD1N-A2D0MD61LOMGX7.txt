Title: hate to vacuum
Content:
I have owned many vacuums - most of them too heavy or too difficult to change from carpet to tile.  The attachments of this vacuum are easy to use and it is light weight.  The canister doesn't hold a lot but I would rather empty a small one more often to have the super suction and convenience of a canister.  It takes care of the pet hair on furniture and floors. If you have a large home or don't like to empty the container often, try something else. This little guy is great for smaller homes & apartments & those who don't like to work hard at vacuuming.

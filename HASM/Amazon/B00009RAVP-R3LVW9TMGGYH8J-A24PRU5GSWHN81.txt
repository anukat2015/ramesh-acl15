Title: very warm but not good quality
Content:
i was very surprised that such a small product could produce so much heat! the only thing i have to "complain" about is the quality. I picked it up once by the handle and it fell. The heater still works, but unfortunately it doesn't swing anymore. i think they should make the handle a little larger or make the base more sturdy! 
UPDATE: it hasn't been two weeks and the heater won't turn on. I also tried calling the 1800 number and there was no operator available. I also looked at the manual and it didn't have any good troubleshooting. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

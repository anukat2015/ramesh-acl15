Title: Piece of s%$&
Content:
If you want a laptop that will be as useful as a block of dung in about 6-8 months then this is your notebook, and anyone who has had a Compaq will all know how great Compaq supports their garbage.  The laptop was always hot even when just being charged, the battery life was a lie and I couldn't even make it through a movie.  In 6 months I had a sound card failure which I lived with, a month later I had the video card go nuts at random times giving me lovely rainbows to look at until it blue screened, I had a ram chip failure which I replaced myself due to fatigue from calling Compaq, then on the 8th month the hard drive died, just died.  I called Compaq and got the run around (when I could actually speak to someone) so this piece of trash went in the garbage.   The hardware is typical HP/Dell/Acer/Compaq low quality, cheap, unreliable and disposable.  Buy an Asus/IBM instead of this, it will last longer and actually has decent support.  Ever wonder why Compaq was/is rated lowest in every product line every year and was bought by HP, this is an example.  Too bad HP decided to adopt Compaq's design into their models making them worse and far less reliable creating the dreaded HP/Compaq line.

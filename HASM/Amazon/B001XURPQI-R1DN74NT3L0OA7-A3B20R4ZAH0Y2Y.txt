Title: Unbelievable in low light, see my sample images of the mummy
Content:
I uploaded three low-light images from the Rosicrucian Museum on 10/19/2009. Sort by date to find them. 
The image of the mummy in particular shows the superb low-light performance of this camera and the 18-55mm lens. People were holding up their cell phones to cast more light so they could see it! I couldn't believe how the Canon T1i somehow created this image. According to the JPEG info, it was snapped at 32mm,  f4.5 at 1/5 second-that's pretty good image stabilization for a handheld image. Shot using the "No Flash" dial setting. 
Other reviewers have said much about this amazing camera. It will be many years before I learn enough to try something it cannot deliver. Highly recommended.

Title: DeLonghi "Support" Embarassing - Definite "Do Not Buy"
Content:
Unfortunately, we purchased this product. After a few months, the reservoir started leaking profusely. We followed DeLonghi's instructions to send the coffee maker back to them for service. After three months, we still do not have the replacement unit or a commitment from DeLonghi as to when it will be returned. Our emails inquiring as to the whereabouts of the unit have resulted only in form letters that do not even address our questions.
The last form letter stated that they were "sorry to hear you are still experiencing difficulties" and that "under warranty, if a service center cannot repair a unit in a reasonable amount of time, they can send the unit to Delonghi.  If Delonghi cannot repair it, they will replace it." Apparently DeLonghi considers more than three months to be within the range of "reasonable amount of time."
Even the best of companies occasionally produce a lemon, but there is no excuse for "customer service" staff stonewalling the very customers who have put bread on their tables.

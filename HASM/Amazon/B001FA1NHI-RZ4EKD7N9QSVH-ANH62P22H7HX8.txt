Title: Very attractive unit but terrible sound quality.
Content:
I couldn't believe my ears when I pushed the play button and experienced the flat and lifeless instrumentation!  This thing sounds like a 20-dollar portable radio!  I tried using the more expensive headphones I use from my CD Walkman and experienced miniscule improvement.  The EQ, which comes with this IPOD, can increase bass a bit but also adds distracting noise distortion. I'll stick with my CD Walkman until the quality of sound is dramatically increased. 
Note: For the sake of curiosity, I plugged the standard issue IPOD headphones into my CD Walkman. Although the music was noticeably inferior when compared to using the Sony units the sound was dramatically improved over using them with the IPOD. I'm astounded that this product is so popular with the public.  Apparently, listening to music is not it's primary draw.

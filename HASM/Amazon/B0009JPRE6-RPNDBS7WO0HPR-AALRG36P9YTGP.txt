Title: Amazing Camera
Content:
I bought this camera 3 years ago and I still really love it. The clarity is unbelievable, even if someone is in motion that your taking a picture of. It's the best camera I've ever had, it's also very sturdy, my 2 year old has knocked over a numerous amount of times. Great camera.

Title: Great heater!!!!!
Content:
It's been 3 months since we bought this heater, we use it everyday  and it works terrific. It warms up our 12'x18' bedroom really fast. We also used it on our large livingroom, it takes a little longer but it does a good job. We are very pleased with this purchase and we'll definitely buy a second one for the next winter.
The remote control is very convenient and the fact that we can program it to reach a desired temperature is a plus. It also works as a fan so we might still use it during summer time.

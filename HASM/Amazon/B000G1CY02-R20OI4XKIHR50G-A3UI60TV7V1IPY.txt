Title: excellent radiant heater
Content:
I heat with wood. I'm an emergency room nurse and work 12-hour shifts--longer than my wood stove will keep my house warm enough that my pipes won't freeze. Was looking at an Eden Pure that made spectacular claims not substantiated by tests at Consumer Reports or the experience of some of my friends. The Delonghi was one of CR's best buys and cost less than a quarter of the Eden Pure, so I tried it. So far it has done an excellent job keeping my house warm when my wood fire burns out. It has a setting that will keep the temperature at 41 degrees. I'll get my electric bill soon and if the change is not more significant than I expect I would move the Delonghi to a 5 out of 5.

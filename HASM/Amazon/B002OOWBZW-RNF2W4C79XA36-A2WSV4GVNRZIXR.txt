Title: Computer broke after 3 days of use
Content:
Yes, this Toshiba's lightweight and fairly well constructed and designed with speedy internet and Windows 7. It functioned well for two days.  But then on the third day of use, the laptop froze. The screen was broken, and I was forced to return it :(

Title: Nice...and heavy.
Content:
After many years, I am back to Nikon.  Loved the SP, the FTn and the FE2.  After that, I switched to Olympus OM-4Ts, to use with their spectacular 24 shift lens.  I'm now using the Nikon 24 PC-e lens which is better than the Olympus, but only by a hair.  (BTW, the Nikkor 24-120 lens that came with this camera is not bad.  It drops off in the extreme corners but otherwise, its darned good and would probably be spectacular on a smaller sensor camera).
I really like the D700 and while its a relatively low megapixel camera (for "full frame") it really shows that a bigger sensor is what makes the difference.  
My only gripe is the weight.  It starts out half a pound heavier than a Canon 5D.  That's OK, but add in a few of Nikon's better lenses and its heavier than my Pentax 67 outfit.  But I guess if you're willing to pay the freight, you have to be willing to haul it, too.  My personal opinion is that this tonnage takes some of the joy out of photography but I guess I'm in the minority, as usual.

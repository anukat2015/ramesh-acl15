Title: A Camera For The Rest of Us
Content:
This camera fills a very important niche - that level of photography between professional and competent point-and-shoot amateurs.  It has all the features that a professional camera requires, including the hot-shoe flash and very nice menu driven range of shooting options.
The value added to this camera is in the lenses.  You really can't beat the deal in cost/value ratio.  The two furnished in this package are more than adequate for most applications.  They are sharp but not professional quality.  If you are looking to build a quality portfolio of images then these will get you well down the road to it.  Macro photo quality is sufficient for just about all the average guy's needs.  Telephoto shots are crisp throughout the range.
The camera misses five stars because I think it needs an option for using the large display to frame the shot rather than only review it after having taken it using the view finder.  Olympus (Zuiko) does have a very nice range of lenses to augment the two that come with the package and that is another excellent reason to purchase the camera.  You can build a very nice camera suite for about 1/2 what you will spend on a Nikon and, let's face it, only a pro will know the difference.
It's a good camera and an excellent price.

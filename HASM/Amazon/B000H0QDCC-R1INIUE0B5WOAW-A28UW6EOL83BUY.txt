Title: Overall solid machine
Content:
I had been waiting for the Zune for a long time.  When I finally got it I was very impressed.  All the software was easy to use and quick to download onto the device.  I really like the fact that everything I had in my Windows Media Player quickly converted over onto the Zune Player(minus some of the videos which through conversion software I have done) much nicer than Itunes.  The screen on it is beautiful and much nicer than the Ipods.  Have not had a chance to try out the wi-fi on it yet, but the fm radio works great.  Would recommend to andybody I know to purchase.  Worth the money, don't consider these other reviews from people who have not tried it.

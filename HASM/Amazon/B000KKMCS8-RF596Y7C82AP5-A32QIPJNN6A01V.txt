Title: The Pelonis is the best heater I've owned!
Content:
I used to live in Northern Idaho and winters can be cold, very cold. I purchased my Pelonis safe-t-furnace 4 disc heater in the mid 1980's for about $60.00. At the time it was a lot for a heater then but I went for it.
The unit has a 1,500 watt max output at 80 degrees a switch for fan only or fan with heat, a thermostat with a range of 50 to 80 degrees. It has a switch to control manual or automatic operation and also has a safety switch that will shut off the heater should it get tipped over.
For over 20 years now it has performed flawlessly. Not a single problem ever. The fan is not totally silent but the small amount of noise isn't distracting to me. 
I recently purchased a Parabolic heater (a mistake) and it throws out good directional heat but fails to warm my 12' x 16' shop. My Pelonis will heat my entire shop as well as any small to medium sized room I've put it in quickly.
As I am typing this review the Pelonis is cranking out the heat keeping my feet nice and toasty.
I've dropped it, dented it, and it still works like it was new.  It is very well built. This is a quality product.
I am getting a second Pelonis and am looking for a used older one like my original. if I can't find one I'll be buying a new model. Even though this is more money than other small ceramic space heaters the durability,quality, and most importantly the heat it puts out makes this space heater a keeper in my book.

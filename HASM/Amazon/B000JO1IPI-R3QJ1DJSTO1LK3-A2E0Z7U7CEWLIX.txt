Title: More than I expected.
Content:
When I ordered the 80 gig iPod for my teenage son, I had no idea how many wonderful features it had.  I have enjoyed seeing his excitement over finding all the neat things it will do.  We love the pictures of the albums, being able to "flip over" the picture and see the list of songs on the "back," and being able to watch videos on the iPod.  When I ordered it, I just knew it had a lot of memory, so it would hold lots of songs.  I did not know how great the video features would be.  We are thrilled with this purchase.

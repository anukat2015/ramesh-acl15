Title: Best money I ever spent
Content:
I bought the Nano for my daughter for her 9th birthday. She adores it. It looks sleek and the screen is impressively big for the size of device.
Her favourite feature is the video and she has been documenting all and sundry in our lives (not a hit with me when I have just woken up and I am still in my pj's!). She loves that she is in control of her music too. 
I used the pedometer and well,......I want one too... 
Ah.. Santa???

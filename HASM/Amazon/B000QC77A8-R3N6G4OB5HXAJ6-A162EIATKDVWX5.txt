Title: Happy with my purchase
Content:
Very happy with the purchase of Lasko #758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater.  It warms up my great room, dining room and kitchen that have vaulted ceilings.  Hopefully will cut down on the gas heating bill, but too early to tell yet as, the first gas bill has not arrived since using this product. I set it and leave it and the temp. comes up to my setting.
Good product!

Title: Happy Hoover Purchaser
Content:
After reading the excellant reviews about this product I decided to go ahead and order this vacuum. The reviews did not lie. This is a fantastic vacuum cleaner. I have never once been happy with the performance of any machine I have owned in the last 20 years (one upright and two cannisters) until this one. I used to have to vacuum a section and then still bend down and pick stuff off the carpet that my old machines weren't strong enough to get. Not so now. This Hoover has an incredibly strong suction. It gets everything up. My carpets have never looked so good. Also, I love a canister because the head can get into spaces that the uprights can't and when I do have a space that's too small for that head the wands disengage easily so I can get into even the tightest corners. I bought this machine based on the recommedations of others. Now I am adding my praise to the list. This is the best vacuum I have ever owned!

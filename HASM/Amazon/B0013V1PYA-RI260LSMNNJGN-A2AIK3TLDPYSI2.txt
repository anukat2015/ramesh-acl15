Title: Great Gift for anyone in a colder climate
Content:
Bought this floor mat for my dad last Christmas.  Initially we anticipated its use in the garage where he works on the snow mobile.  But it actually found a home in his office, which has a cement floor.  Since his office is attached to a factory, there is no below-ground level, and that means that all winter cold temperatures are channeled up from the floor.  Regardless of the shoes he wears, he still deals with cold feet and legs.  Anyway, I've heard only good things about it since he took it into the office, and everyone else who works with him has asked about it.

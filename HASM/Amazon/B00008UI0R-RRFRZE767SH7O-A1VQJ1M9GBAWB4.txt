Title: Not a bad little vacuum cleaner
Content:
After much reading and a bit of frustration in not finding one I could actually get my hands on at a local outlet, I went ahead and ordered the Hoover S3765.  Having had an old Rainbow and Meile in a 'previous life', I wanted something that could be a real work horse...carpeted stairs, carpeting, area rugs, tile floors, furniture, and tough-to-reach spots.  I've now been using this vacuum for about a month and am, for the most part, extremely satisfied...
PROs:  It has great suction, the controls in the handle for suction, the power head, and to turn it off are great. It's a good size, and dealing with the dust cup and filters isn't really all that bad.  The telescoping wand is fantastic (I can vacuum all under our king bed from one side).  The small suction-powered power head works great on the stairs.
CONs:  There is no swivel for the hose on either the power head or the handle which is just a bit inconvenient at times.  I haven't had a canister in some time so it seems somewhat cumbersome with the hose - BUT PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE.  While the dust cup is easy to empty, it doesn't hold much - with 2 dogs, I usually empty it a few times (not a bad idea anyway, as I think it helps to keep the odor down.)  Lastly, there is no height adjustment for the big power head so the brush slows down alot on a couple of my area rugs - I end up pulling the head toward me rather than pushing and pull in...but it works great on my normal carpeting.
If I wanted to spend another $200 or so, I'm sure I could have gotten everything I wanted.  Nevertheless, after everything is said and done, this vacuum is a great value.  If I had it to do all over, I would buy it again.

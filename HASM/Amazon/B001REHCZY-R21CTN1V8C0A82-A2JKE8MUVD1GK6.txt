Title: Doesn't anyone offer an alternative?
Content:
I purchased this model 2 years ago and have hated it ever since.  The unit has lights all over it that stay on needlessly.  The reservoir is hard to fill.  The installation was abhorrent. I had to remove the brew pause button because the tension on the spring was so strong that it would push the carafe out of the receptacle and dump coffee all over the counter.  And even after that, the unit still leaks water all over the counter when brewing.  Finally, yesterday the handle on the carafe fell apart (I only use the unit on weekends, so it doesn't see that much ware).  Doesn't anyone offer an alternative brand that works?  Even with my limited counter space, I would not purchase another Black & Decker coffee maker.

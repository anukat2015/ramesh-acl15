Title: Great Little Vacuum
Content:
I searched a lot on the internet before deciding on this vacuum.  For the price, I think it is a good buy.  Some of the things I like about it are:
1.  It's attractive.
2.  It's light weight and easy to pull around.
3.  The location of the controls are very convenient.
4.  Easy to switch from hard floor attachment to carpet attachment.
5.  No need to buy bags or filters (filters are washable.)
It does have one drawback, but considering all the good points and the low price, I can put up with it.  And that is, the hardfloor attachment comes off occasionally because there is nothing to "click" it into place.  Maybe the manufacturer will think of something to improve this model in the future.  GOOD LUCK in your search for a vacuum!

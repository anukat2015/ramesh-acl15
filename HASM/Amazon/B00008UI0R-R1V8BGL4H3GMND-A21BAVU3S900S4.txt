Title: Super Vacuum
Content:
This review is based on one month of ownership.The Hoover Electronic WindTunnel Bagless Canister is very quiet. The variable speed is a good feature, different speed for different surfaces. It fits under all of our wooden furniture easily. The canister is reasonable sized, with 5 cats, we have to empty it while using it, but it REALLY picks up the hair. The cord is long enough for us to do any room in our medium sized house. The only design feature that should be changed is that it is too easy to hit the "carpet/floor" button by accident and turn off the rollers. The attachments work well.

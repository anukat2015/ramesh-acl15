Title: LOVE my Kurv!!
Content:
I got my Kurv about 3 weeks ago and absolutely love it! During my research of different hand vacs, I read some negative things about the Kurv so I went out and bought the Dirtdevil Extreme Power. I brought it home, got it out of the box and realized how ugly and heavy it was. I returned it and decided to take my chances with the Kurv. I have to say I am beyond pleased with it. I have 3 young kids, a dog, and a cat so there are constantly little messes that are easily cleaned up with the Kurv. This saves me from having to drag out the big vacuum. The suction is quite strong and it does the job quickly. The angled end also makes going around edges super easy. Also very important for me is that it looks so nice sitting out on my bookshelf... a great hand vac and a great piece of art!

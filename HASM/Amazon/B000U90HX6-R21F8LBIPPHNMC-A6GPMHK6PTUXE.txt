Title: Pleasantly Surprised
Content:
I just bought this last night at a local home-improvement store (for less than a new one here). I got an extended warranty on it. I plugged it in, turned it on, it started pumping out heat right away! In less than 10 minutes, it heated up my 11x10 living room from 63 degrees to 73 degrees. I am very impressed with this guy, the unit does not feel hot to the touch, it does what it says, and I really like the remote it comes with. FOUR STARS!

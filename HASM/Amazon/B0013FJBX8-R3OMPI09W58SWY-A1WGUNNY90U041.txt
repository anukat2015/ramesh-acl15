Title: Top Quality, Top Performance
Content:
What really sets the MacBook Pro apart from Microsoft-based laptops is the extraordinary build quality and pure, consistent performance of these elegant machines.  I bought a top-of-the-line HP, custom built with all the best components, and thats exactly what it feels like - a bunch of high-end components screwed together.  Even though my HP looks much better on paper, its feel and performance are not up to the standards of the MacBook Pro (yes, I use both)!
My HP has more memory, a faster CPU, a larger and faster hard drive, a bigger graphics card, and a Blu-Ray drive, but my MacBook is faster, looks better, NEVER crashes, and requires little to no administration (forget about virus protection, disk defrag, autoruns, etc...).
Apple creates an extraordinary product because of its tight control and vertical integration, and that's reflected in the high price too.  But be warned...  GHz to GHz, GB to GB comparisons with HP, Dell, Toshiba, Sony, etc...  mean very little here.  This computer beats them all, despite the numbers.  Where the HP is like the Corvette, the MacBook Pro is like the Mercedes 55 AMG.

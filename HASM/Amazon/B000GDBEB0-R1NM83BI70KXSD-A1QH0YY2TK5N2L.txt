Title: NOT WORTH  IT
Content:
This product did not live up to my expectations in so many ways. As mentioned, the GFI plug is ultra sensitive, you'll give up on setting the time after it trips for the 10th time in three hours, you cannot get it to shut off at desired temp, and the design of the unit is terrible. I was told by several online retailers that this unit was "drip free," although I should expect to empty it "occasionally" if I live in an especially humid environment. Well, living in Southern California (and having lived on the East Coast for a brief stint) I presumed I'd be ok with an "occasional" emptying. I was even told by one retailer that their firm was located in Southern Cal and they ran their unit for a month without needing to empty it. Well, maybe I just generate more humidity inside my home than they do. Anyway, I empty it twice a day now. Moreover, it makes a lovely beeping noise and flashing indicator to let me know it needs to be emptied, which is great to have when you're sleeping. I like waking up at 3 am to my AC flashing and beeping like a fire alarm. But I digress. Back to the design flaws of this unit- the drain plug is conveniently located so low on the unit (MAYBE an entire inch off the floor) that it takes several trips to drain it into their convenient drip pan (provided for your emptying pleasure). The exhaust hose on the unit gets very hot; I mean, hot to the touch. 
Listen, there are so many cons to this unit, and this review could go on for another paragraph or 7 describing them. However, I think you get the point. If you like poor design, bad quality, false advertising and high maintenance, this just might be the unit for you.  Otherwise, stay away.

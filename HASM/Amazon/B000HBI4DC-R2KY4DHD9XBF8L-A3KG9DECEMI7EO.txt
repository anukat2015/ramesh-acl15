Title: Grind & Brew Perfection
Content:
Want a grind & brew coffee maker that gets it right?  This is it.  Conical Burr grinder, 200 degree brewing tempurature, 8 minute brew cycle.  Adjustable grind corseness, adjustable strength.  Use fresh roasted coffee (my favorite is Caffe Pronto Bronco Blend) & clean fresh water & you have a perfect cup of coffee.  A little more expensive than other grind & brews, but you are getting quality - worth every penny.

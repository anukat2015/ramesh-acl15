Title: Good power but needs constant cleaning of canister
Content:
From a pure suction vantage point, this machine is awesome.  It sucks everything up. It's relatively easy to maneuver. It looks sturdy and well made.  BUT the canister fills up quickly, so you often have to dump it out. I've always had vacuums with bags so never had to deal with this before. It's a definite downside for me.  AND the filter is a pain to clean. You have to use this little brush to clean between the cylindrical filter's grooves (and there are many). All the while, dust is flying in your face.  I take it outside to clean and try not to breathe while doing so.  It's a bit inconvenient. I guess if your main goal is to save a few bucks on bags then this is the product for you. My next vacuum will be one with bags!

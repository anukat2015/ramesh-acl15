Title: Perfect!
Content:
Shipping was extremely fast!  I opened the box and plugged it in to the 30 amp 240 volt outlet I have in my garage and it warmed it up fast.  I have a 400 SQFT garage in the Chicago-land area (currently it is 10F outside) but it is 78F in my garage.
The price was right, the heater is good and it was an easy and fast transaction.
I am very happy with the Marley Heater!!

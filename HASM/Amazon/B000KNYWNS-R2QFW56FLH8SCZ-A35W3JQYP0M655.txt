Title: Good Little Unit
Content:
I bought this air conditioner last year and its presently in my bedroom.  I like it for its light and easy to set up. The side flaps are a little flimsy.  However I have found that to be something of a norm on even higher end conditioners. Also, its vents direct the cool air up wards which I like for it's in a window where an otherwise straight out design would result in too much air being directed right at you.  Although I have noticed at times the "paddle boat" sound that some others here have complained about, I find it to be far less annoying than emphasized, and not at all something that happens consistently.  I agree with other reviewers here that drilling a small drain hole in the rear of the unit is a good option if your particular to this noise and don't like it. And it is not fair that this model should be singled out for that flaw. I have had to do this on other brands many times over the years.  As far as the overall noise of this unit, I do not find it any noisier than other conditioners of various brands and BTUs.  And it is certainly far less noisy than the Maytag unit I have in my den that sounds like a continuous freight train running past. I recommend this unit for its lightweight upward flow design, as well as I feel its quality.  The water sound and overall noise that a lot of folks are squawking about here I feel may be a result of not owning as many kinds of air conditioners as myself over the years and thus not used to how noisy they usually can be in any event...

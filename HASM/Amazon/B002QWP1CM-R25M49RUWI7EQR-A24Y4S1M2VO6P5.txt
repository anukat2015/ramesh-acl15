Title: not as advertised
Content:
This product didn't not even heat up a 300sq foot area, treied in in smaller rooms as well, but with the same results.   when i asked the Company. for a refund, before doing so, they sent me a 2 paragraph email explaining that their products front thermostat is incorrect (when i explained that the thermo on the unit did not go up past 70 degrees) and advised me to get another thermometer for my room. Also advised me that this product needs to be in a well insulated room to POSSIBLE be effect.  If i was in a well insulated room i wouldnt need the heater..am i right???

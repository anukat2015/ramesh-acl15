Title: Great Coffee and Lattes
Content:
After a couple weeks of use, I'm very impressed with this.  The coffee maker makes great coffee (water brews at proper temp.) and has the tapered-style filter, which helps quality, especially when making less than a full pot.  Does NOT have auto-off feature.  The Espresso side of the unit is equally impressive.  It offers good control of water flow rate, or the water can be turned off while steaming milk.  Does NOT come with a frothing pitcher, so consider one of these as well as a thermometer (unless you have a calibrated finger to hold to the side of your frothing pitcher).

Title: Disappointed
Content:
Well, I bought this coffee maker around 3 years ago and I got some good use out of it but it just stopped working a couple of months ago.  I also agree that the machine feels cheep and I guess it proved cheap since it stopped working.  I never had a coffee maker just die on me and I am disappointed that I only got 3 years out of it.

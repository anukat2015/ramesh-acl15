Title: Great Customer Service from Mr. Heater
Content:
I picked this up half price at the end of season last spring.  I hired someone to hang it and sheetrock my garage and hired a plumber for the gas.  I waited till this fall to wire it up in preparation for my 2nd Minnesota winter.
I had some self induced pain getting it wired correctly but customer service was wonderful and got me parts I needed extremely quickly without any grief.  I put a programmable thermostat in my house and took the old Honeywell T8400C and wired it to the Mr. Heater and it seems to work just fine.  I'll update this if anything changes but I'm looking forward to having a useable garage this winter.

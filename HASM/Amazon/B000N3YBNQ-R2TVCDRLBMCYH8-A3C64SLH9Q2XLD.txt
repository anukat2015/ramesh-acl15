Title: Not for me
Content:
I bought this vacuum when it first came out.  I had it for a while and I hated it, Oh sure the suction is great, but for a small vacuum it was very heavy and not easy to move around.  You can not vacuum under anything because it is to big in front and comes with no attachments so forget about doing stairs and furniture.  If this is the kind of vacuum you are looking for then this is the one, oh just be careful too if you have square or rectangle area rugs this will suck up the corners and destroy them, it did it to two of my rugs, chewed them right up also chewed up its own cord when I ran over it.  The suction is very great but if you want to vacuum under furniture or beds or do your stairs and upholstery than look elsewhere.  I finally did, and I am very happy now with my new vacuum.  So like my title said this vacuum may be for some people but it was not for me.

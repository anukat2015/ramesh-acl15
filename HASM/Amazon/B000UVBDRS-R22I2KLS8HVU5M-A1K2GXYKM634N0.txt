Title: Worst Customer Service - Non existant
Content:
This was my fourth Creative player that I have purchased, 2 - Muvo 256 kb, Vision M and now this Zen 4gb. This will be the last not because of the product functionality but the frustrating lack of customer service support for issues. 
I charged the battery for 6 plus hours before loading as per instructions and found the battery only lasting 2-3 hours just listening to audiobooks, no videos. OK, I tried calling Support and found the only way to contact Creative is through a convoluted knowledge base and finally an email. After a frustrating barrage of emails sending me to redundant knowledge base documents and finally a firmware upgrade and reset. The battery life has not improved and an RMA link was issued. Instead of providing a completed RMA to me, I was sent to a link to manually create the RMA with the same information that I had entered before.
I like the product but will not put up with the lack of support again.

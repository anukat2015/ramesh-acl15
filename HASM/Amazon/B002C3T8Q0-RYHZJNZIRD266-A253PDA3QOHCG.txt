Title: Paid too much @ Amazon
Content:
The coffee maker is fine. It does all the things I need it to. It got here 12/14/09 and I paid $29.99 plus shipping. Last night, 12/15/09, I saw it at the local Walmart for $17.00. I paid almost twice as much through Amazon, plus shipping. The coffee is fine but I am bitter.

Title: Why spend more ?
Content:
Every product has a market and trying to criticize the D5000 for slightly lower quality pictures when using ISO at 1600 or above when compared with more expensive cameras or talking about the fact that the continues shooting speed is more like 3 than 4 and not as fast as the D90 or higher models makes no sense.
The sensor is the same as the d300, a camera 1000 dollars more expensive, even it autofocus is not available when filming, the simple fact that high res video recording is available is great for a camera at that price range.
I have taken amazing photos with this camera, there is enough settings to play with to get great details and colors in different environment.
If you don't need a camera for professional reason there is no need to spend one more dime than what this camera cost to get beautiful photos.

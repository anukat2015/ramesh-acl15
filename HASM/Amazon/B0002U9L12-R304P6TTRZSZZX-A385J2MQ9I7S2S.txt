Title: good coffee maker; no problems
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for almost two years.  I make about a pot of coffee a day.  I bought this coffee maker after owning numerous other brands (cheap and expensive ones). I think this coffee tastes as good or better than the coffee from my Krups maker.  The carafe is durable.  If I keep the top closed , I can have a hot cup of coffee hours after it is finished brewing.  Because it's kept warm from the carafe and not from a bottom burner, the coffee doesn't taste burnt hours later.  I also like the fact that as soon as the coffee is brewed, the heating unit is off.  I really like the fact that the carafe isn't glass and it's very durable.  I have owned other brands and had to replace the carafe because they cracked/smashed on the floor.  The cost of the replacement carafe + shipping cost was at least half the price of a new coffee maker.
I also really like the water reservoir because it's very easy to read.

Title: Great replacement for my 50D. Simple review
Content:
Video
Master flash controller
18MP
Great pics on hish ISO shots
The quick menu for easy access
These are the main things that sold me on the upgrade. I have had a Rebel XT, 30D, 50D, and now the 7D so it is very easy for me to use as the controls are very similar. This is definitely heavier than the 50D. Especially when you add a 28-70 2.8 L lens, Dual battery pack, and a flash. Very excited to learn every bit of this camera.

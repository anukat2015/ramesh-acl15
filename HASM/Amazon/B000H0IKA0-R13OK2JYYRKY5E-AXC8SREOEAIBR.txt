Title: Cute, compact, and mighty!
Content:
My mistake was not reading all of the directions so I thought it didn't work; thus, the only drawback I see to this is the 47MB iTunes download (even if you're not downloading any music from iTunes). But once it works, it's amazing how much music comes out of that tiny little thing. Note to Apple: 47MB is a lot to put on your computer just to download music. Provide options- with or without the iTunes store.

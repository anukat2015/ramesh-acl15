Title: Can't be beat
Content:
I have had my percolator for going on 6 years and am just now in the market for a new one.  My Farberware still brews a delicious cup of coffee, but it no longer heats my joe properly (I prefer my coffee to burn my insides going down!).  I believe that the lukewarm temperature can be attributed to my dropping the carafe and cracking the base.  
I have seen many drip makers come and go in my day -- never once lasting to the six-year mark.  As for quality of brew, family and friends consistently compliment me on the taste and temperature (before the last few months, that is) of my coffee.  I will never go back to drip makers.  
I love that this pot is easy-to-clean with it's removable cord and stainless steel parts.  It brews its eight cups in no more time than it takes a drip machine.
I love a good french press now and again, but even that doesn't compare to the smoothness and flavor from my percolator.  Highly, highly recommended.

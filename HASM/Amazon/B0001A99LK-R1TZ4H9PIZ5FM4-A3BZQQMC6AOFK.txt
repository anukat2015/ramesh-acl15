Title: Awesome........................
Content:
This is my first MP3 player and I'm in love. I-Tunes is very user friendly and I was able to copy the majority of my favorite cd's into i-tunes with no problems. I was amazed that it only took about 30 minutes to transfer about 300 songs to my ipod. 
I ended up buying the dock and the Logic3 stereo speakers, but found that the charging dock was a waste of money. I use the Logic3 (which has incredible sound output for something so compact)at work, but it also does double duty as a charger. 
The only problem I have is that i-tunes doesn't recognize my ipod as soon as I connect it to my computer. It usually takes me tinkering with the program software before it responds. 
Overall, I'm very happy with the features and I show it off everytime someone stops by my desk.

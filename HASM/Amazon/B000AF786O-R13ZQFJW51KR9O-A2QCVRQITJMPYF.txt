Title: The travel mug is a joke
Content:
As the other reviewer said, the brew cone works wonderfully.  Throw away that fancy $150 auto drip that sings Dixie. This little cone will make better tasting coffee.
However, the travel mug is a joke.  The lid does not seal or lock shut in any way.  All you can do is simply place the lid on top of the mug, and hope it doesn't come flying off when you hit a pothole while driving... and don't tilt the mug too far back when going to take a swallow, because the lid might pop off and  scalding coffee will pour all over you.  This has not happened to me yet, but it has leaked and dripped out on me. Not fun.
However, the travel mug is well insulated and can make for a suitable thermos for home, as long you are aware that you should not drink directly from the mug while the lid is on.

Title: My aunt loves her Edenpure Heater
Content:
Here's what she says of it: 
"Perhaps you've seen the ads for the EdenPure heater. I got one last year, and am downright ecstatic with it. Gas had not been installed on the lot where my mobile home was place.  So I've used electric heaters the 7 years I've lived here, and was so afraid of fire I would not leave them on when I went to bed, or was gone. Needless to say, even with our minimal cold weather down here (low 30s occasionally), I was uncomfortably cold a lot of the time when we would have a taste of winter. One of the top selling points of the EdenPure is that it WILL NOT START A FIRE! My pets can sit on it, as external surfaces do not get hot. I leave it on night and day, with thermostat lowered at night, and my electric bill was lower than when I had the space heaters on only part of the time! In colder areas, it would have to be used in a closed room, or in addition to furnace with lowered thermostat."

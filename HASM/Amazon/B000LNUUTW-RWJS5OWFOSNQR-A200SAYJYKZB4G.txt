Title: Great if you live near point of shipping
Content:
This is a good product as far as heaters go but I must say I'm pretty disappointed with Amazon and Ace Hardware.  If you live in Canada it's not worth it. 
The product cost $119.00 which I thought was a fair price. I knew I'd have to pay some shipping costs, it ended up being about $100 more, which I thought was steep but I was still willing to pay because I had read it was a good product. Once the product arrived I had to pay another $45 in duty fees, which I expected was an included part of the exhorbitant shipping costs. Bottom line - $119 product, paid $270. I'm totally dissatified with my purchase.

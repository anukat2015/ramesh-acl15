Title: Best camera I've ever used
Content:
I've had this camera now for 6 months. I heard all the hype about it's "faults" etc so was a little concerned. But, then I really started to read, and found that most of the issue was hype. Only some photographers in some specific conditions had the problem.  Then Canon announced some hardware and firmware fixes.
This camera is just stunning.  The quick and accurate AF is brilliant. It can lock on and track the target very well. It's clearly sharper for centre focus but also does brilliant for landscape images and still portraits.
The fps and burst rate is second to none. It's a beast when you set it off. I shoot mostly sport, so a nice burst can be the difference between capturing and missing that image.
The body is great. Not too heavy for what it does, and it's balanced very well. The construction and weather sealing are great.
I could go on and on about just how good this camera is. It is well worth having a look at. So, go to your local store, feel the camera, fire off a burst and then there's no going back.

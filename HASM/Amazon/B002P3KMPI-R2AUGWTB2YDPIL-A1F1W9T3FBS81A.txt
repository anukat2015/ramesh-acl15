Title: ASUS UL50VT-A1
Content:
It is a nice thin lightweight laptop with plenty of processing power and it looks good. I bought it to play games on and it works. I would have liked Bluetooth and the screen doesn't have the best viewing angles. So it's not the perfect laptop but I would have no hesitations recommending the computer to anyone.

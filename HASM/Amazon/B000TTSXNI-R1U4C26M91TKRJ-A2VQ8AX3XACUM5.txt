Title: Keeps my finished basement at a consistent temperature
Content:
My basement is finished, but there are some cold spots throughout the basement, especially when we had nights recently that were sub zero with wind chill.  It's a "half" basement, but it's the size of my kitchen / dining room / family room, so it's not a small box.  We bought this to level set our temperature and make sure we kept everything at our comfort level.  This heater has not disappointed us by any stretch and probably exceed expectations.  The oscillating fan is great and with the temperature control, it is only on when necessary.  Good bang for the buck.
My mother in law asked me to buy her one for her so I obliged.  Waiting to see what she thinks.

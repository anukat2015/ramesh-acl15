Title: poor customer service/quality
Content:
I ordered the Ipod nano for Christmas and instead received a 6 page cardboard children's book.  Because there is no phone number on the receipt (that stated Ipod) I got online and talked to a customer service rep who could not explain where the problem was.  She was able to get my account credited, but I had to go back and order another one, which was more expensive.  She also said she would send me a $20 coupon to use on my next purchase, which I never received.  I rate this transaction 1 star because 0 stars is not an option.

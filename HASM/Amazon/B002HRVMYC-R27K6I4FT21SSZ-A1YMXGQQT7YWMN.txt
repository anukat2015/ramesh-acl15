Title: Nice size, keypad, XP vs Vista loaded on it
Content:
I got this for basic browsing and personal use - not for business or gaming. The power, speed and memory were adequate for my needs. 
I like the quality of this product, the user friendly keyboard, and the fact that it has XP operating system vs Vista - which I hate. I also don't care for the system hogging McAfee which is pre loaded (and expires in 30 days), but you can put in another one like AVG that uses less memory.

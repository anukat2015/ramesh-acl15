Title: Very Disappointed~Had high hopes for good coffee.
Content:
After reading all the reviews I decided to side with the good reviews and think positive. Wrong choice.
First the water spits out the side as it drips. The lid falls off when you pour even with your thumb on top. If you cover it any more you would be burned. And as another reviewer said the band is so lose it feels like the handle is going to fall off.
If you are willing to deal with that you won't be when you taste the coffee. I tried 5 times opening new bags of coffee too. Awful tasting. Like chemicals.
So it is going back so glad Amazon has the 30 day return policy. Too much to pay for something that doesn't work.

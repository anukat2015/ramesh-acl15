Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
I'm basically happy with this space heater.
Pros: Cheap and it works.
Cons: It's loud and it turns on intermittently according to your thermostat setting so it's constantly: OFF (quite) - ON (loud) - OFF (quiet) - ON (loud) ... etc and so it can be a little annoying if you don't have any other background noise going on.

Title: Exceeded my expectations
Content:
This is hands-down the best computer I've ever owned. I've owned PC laptops since 1998 and am never going back, particularly to "Dell hell." The first week or so was an adjustment from Windows, but as I've gotten used to and discovered more features, I love this computer! I adore the mouse and regularly use the 1, 2, 3, and 4 finger motions. For example, It's so helpful to be able to go back and forward in Safari using the 3-finger swipe. I've used garage band to easily record lectures for my teaching and I just love everything about the computer. If you're on the fence, don't delay. The new price makes this computer finally affordable (the high price deterred me in the past). The computer runs so fast and I've yet to have a problem. The only con is that you have to pay a lot for anything more than 90 days of phone support with Apple Care.

Title: Gateway NV7920u 17.3-Inch Laptop (Cherry Red)
Content:
Bought this from amazon.com a few weeks ago.  I too was worried about that one customer review but couldnt find another brand that has all the goodies - core i5 processor, 17.3" wide screen, built in blu ray/dvd, 4GB DDR3 memory, 500GB hard drive, etc.  Glad I took a chance.  Best bang for the buck!  Works flawlessly with my D Link DIR 855 immediately.  Blu ray movies look and sound great.  No need for external speakers.  Love the bright 17.3" 1600x900 resolution.  Processor speed is very responsive - seems to outperform my ACER desktop (3GB DDR3) with core 2 quad processor.  Battery life with continuous wi-fi and movies on are approximately 3 hours.  The laptop feels surprisingly lightish.  No issue lugging it on vacations.

Title: Vista is ruining this amazing laptop
Content:
I really enjoyed using this laptop, but I feel Vista is too heavy for it. Also, the mouse pointer is so sensitive. I did some stuff to make it more useful:
1- I disabled the mouse pointer as a click button.
2- Change the screen resolution, so you can read without a magnifier.
One thing u need to buy if you want to use it for long time u need to buy the extended battery because the original battery life is so short even when you turn off the WI-fi and bluetooth.

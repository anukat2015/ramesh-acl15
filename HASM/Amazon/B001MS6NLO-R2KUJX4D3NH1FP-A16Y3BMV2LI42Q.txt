Title: Good, soild product!
Content:
A long time ago, I used to have a VAIO desktop computer. It ran great, it had everything I wanted and it runs to this day ... When I want to use an older processor and motherboard. But I purchased this new VAIO laptop as a "part-time business use, part-time personal use" machine. And boy does it serve that role well!
Pros: Best screen (resolution and size), good (but not great) hardware components, Blu Ray!, very usuable - right out of the box, good quality sound (but... see the cons)
Though I do not have many complaints about this product, there are some things I wish worked better.
Cons: Speakers - while sounding good - are very quiet, short power cord from the brick compared to other laptops, Wireless NIC drivers have some problems, heavy and bulky (but no more so than other laptops in this size), doesn't come with Vista Ultimate, my preferred OS until 7 is released.
The only on going problem with this machine is that the wireless NIC drivers have trouble connecting to the VPN at my office. The built-in speakers are very quiet, though very nice sounding, during movie playback. If you don't have good headphones, you might want to consider add-on external speaker(s). Other than that, this machine runs like a champ and I hope will give me many years of good service.

Title: This Machine Sucks!
Content:
After 30 years of using uprights, the switch to a canister vacuum meant I spent a little time climbing the learning curve, but the suction power of this machine is awesome (in a home with two dogs and two cats).  My carpets have never been cleaner.  Yes, the dirt cup fills quickly, but it is easily emptied into a garbage can in the garage, and the filter cleans quickly with the provided tool.
The downsides of this vacuum are 1) the hose should be about one foot longer (when cleaning stairsteps by hand) and, 2) the canister is constantly hanging up against a piece of furniture or at a hallway corner (although I have found that by keeping the trailing hose in my other hand, I can usually keep moving right along).
I purchased this machine in September for $213, so maybe prospective buyers should be on the lookout for future price declines.
Overall, highly recommended.

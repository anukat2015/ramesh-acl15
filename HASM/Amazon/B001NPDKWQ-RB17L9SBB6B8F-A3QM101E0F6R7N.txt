Title: Great deal for the money
Content:
This is a great laptop for the money. I bought it knowing it was larger, not the fastest computer available and that Vista would be different to opperate but to my surprise none of these things have mattered. I use it primarily at home...used it on a plane ride and it was fine carrying in a backpack. The keyboard is nice to type on; easy strokes and not very much noise when you're a fast typer. Vista really is not as bad as many people have made it out to be; only ran into one program I had to upgrade because the older version I owned was not compatible. It runs fast enough for what I need it for and I enjoy the graphics. It has some very nice features to it as well. It has settings to choose your power level so that when you unplug it you can leave it bright or lower depending on the power usage you want to use. The monitor is visable in direct sunlight too. Lots of user friendly functions built in to Vista make using it easy too. I'm very pleased with my purchase of my first HP laptop and received my computer very promptly from J & H Warehouse.

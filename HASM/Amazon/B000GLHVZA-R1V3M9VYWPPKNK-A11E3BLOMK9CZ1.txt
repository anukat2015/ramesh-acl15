Title: Does the job
Content:
I am pleased with the Vornado full-room heater.  It does heat the room as described. I am using it in my living room
which is actually an open space to the sun room and kitchen............so this heater is covering a good amount of space. I bought it so that I don't have to turn up the thermostat on the propane heating system which costs a rediculous amount of money. Thus, I am saving money with this heater. It is silent, safe and radiates warmth throughout the room. I would certainly recommend this product. I own 2 smaller Vornados and I am equally pleased with them.

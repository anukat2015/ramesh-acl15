Title: pretty good heater
Content:
I am very happy with it. It makes my room pretty warm and cozy. 
It performs so well, and sometimes it just makes the room too warm. Even put on the lowest power and the lowest temperature, it keeps warming the room up. Sometimes I have to turn it off and cool down. 
The only bad thing is that it requires a humidifier, since it dries up the room a lot.

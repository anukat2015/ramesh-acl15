Excellent vacuum!  After reading Consumer Reports, talking with friends, and researching different vacuums on the internet, I chose this one.  I'm 100% pleased!  It is light weight, easy to handle and quiet.  We have hardwood, vinyl & carpet floors, pets, stairs & kids.  I used to vacuum weekly; however, with this vacuum it has decreased to every other week!  My two boys love to use it also.  My 8 year old said, "We should have house cleaning parties every Saturday!".  
My recommendations - (1) Use the 15" wide brush for bare floors, as it will loosten dirt also.  (2) To clean the filter use the hose on a gentle pressure.  Then all the dirt returns to nature and doesn't clog your pipes.

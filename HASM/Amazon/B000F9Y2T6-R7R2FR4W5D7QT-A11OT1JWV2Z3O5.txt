Title: Disappointed in Amazon
Content:
This was the second time I was purchasing a vacuum as the wrong one was sent to me in my first purchase. When I finally received the second vacuum, it arrived outside of the original packaging. The item was thrown in the box, the styrofoam packaging was broken and pieces of the vacuum were missing. I think amazon sent me a vacuum that someone else may have previously returned. Very disappointed.

Title: What button?
Content:
I really like this Mozaic and the gb. However...I cannot for the life of me figure out what button to push for which action. This has been very frustrating. I have read the keypad instructions over & over, but still don't get it. I'm sure I'm just confused; in other words, it's me not the Mozaic. I have 2 other Creative Zens and they are not hard at all to manipulate. Can anyone help me or should I remain helpless? Sound is good.

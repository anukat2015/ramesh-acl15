Toshiba Satellite L515-S4925 14.0-Inch Laptop - Black/Grey
I intended to buy a similar notebook from lenovo, but the company experienced 6 weeks production difficulties, so I switched to toshiba. Previously, I was disappointed from toshiba, cause all notebooks I had purchased before were pretty short living, regardless of problems they used to have. 
This particular laptop is thought to be second in the houshold, mostly for mobile computing. My main working machine is sony 15.4" notebook. 
At this point I am pretty satisfied with this toshiba product. 
Weaknesseses: it came with Windows Vista Home Premium and was eligible for Windows 7 upgrade, however, I have been waiting for this DVD for 1 month and still haven't get it. No bluetooth, no RAM extension, no additional software, weak built-in camera for remote conversations (Sony puts far better cameras on comparable models with apparently same number of pixels). Unpleasant touchpad mouse, coarse for fingertips.
Strengths: light, good battery time, fast, nice finish and display, in opposit to some previous toshiba models not overheating, and quiet.
Overall, nice value for this price.

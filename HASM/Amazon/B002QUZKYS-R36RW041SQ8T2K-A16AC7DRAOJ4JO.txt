Title: Very satisfied
Content:
This laptop was an upgrade from a desktop and it was well worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for something fairly basic. I my main use for this computer is for the internet and organizing my photos, and for those purposes, it works great. Watching videos and dvd's is also great, the Dolby Home Theater sound is wonderful. 
My only complaints would be that the touch pad is very sensitive and is easy to hiT while typing and the top of the laptop easily shows fingerprints- definitely not affecting the function at all, but a bit of an annoyance at times.

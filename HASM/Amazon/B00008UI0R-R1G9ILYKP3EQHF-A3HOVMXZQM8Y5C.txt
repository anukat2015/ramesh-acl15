Title: Seemingly not built to last
Content:
After having this product for around one year, we are pleased with its suction power. Not as good as a Dyson (nothing is) but good for this price range. The problem is that the rolling brush only works intermittently because of a loose connection (this only started recently). The electrical connections run the length of the hose, so it is important that a) you are careful in handling the hose and b) lucky that the connection does not wear over time. After one year, it seems the time is up for this Hoover and at this price, I would want such a product to last longer.

Title: DO NOT BUY!!!
Content:
If I could give this product ZERO STARS, I would.  This is a horrible product!  The advantage to having a burr grinder over a blade style grinder is to get a uniform grind.  This grinder in this coffee pot produced grounds that looked like they have simply been smashed with a hammer;  there were big chucks of bean and powder.  Also, on the grinder lid it states you need to keep the bean hopper dry.  You can't do this because the machine sends steam through the grinder and into the hopper.  This extra moisture makes the beans stick together and stick to the inside of the hopper and they will not feed into the grinder.  The machine is not smart enough to know that it hasn't ground any beans, it just brews a pot of lightly colored water.  It does not brew coffee.  The carafe is advertised as being thermal, it isn't.  The carafe is fairly thin stainless steel, but it has a lip around the top, so you can't pour out all of the colored water.  In addition, the carafe isn't graduated, so you have no idea how much water to put in the machine before it try's to brew you a cup of warm, colored, flavorless water.  This could be solved if you could see the scale on the machine, except the designers decided to hide the window on the back of the machine, so you need to be able to walk all the way around the machine to put the water in and to see how much water you put in.  This is a horrible design!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

Content:
I got one of these for Christmas. I asked for an iPod Video but I got this. Im glad that I did cause this thing has more features that I like than the iPod does and its like the iPod has a delay everytime you switch songs and what not. The only thing about it, its real thick but that aint a big deal to me. If you willing to spend a few more bucks to get your money$ worth, I recommend getting one of these. Setting pictures as your background, FM Radio, Bright Display Screen. Everything about it is great. I hope that I was a bit of help on this product.

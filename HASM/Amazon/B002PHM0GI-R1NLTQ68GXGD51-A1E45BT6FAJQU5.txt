Title: Very happy with this Laptop
Content:
I recently purchased this for Christmas for a family member as a gift.  The Sony VAIO VGN-FW510F/H 16.4-Inch Gray Laptop is very user friendly.  The person using this is not the best with computer technology but Sony makes things very easy to understand and all the functions are obvious and easy.  Windows 7 is very nice, intuitive and connected with printers and other peripherals very easily.  I think for under $800 this laptop is a great buy.  16.4 "makes it easy to read for the entire family, and yet it is not cumbersome at all.  I like this much better than the 14 or 15" models I looked at in the stores.  
Battery life is not bad, but less than the stats stated here.  I'd say 90 min is reasonable expectation with normal use.    No blu-ray drive, but that isn't a big deal to me yet.  Otherwise, I can't find much wrong with this laptop, and I would buy again if I needed another one.

Title: I would give it a zero if possible.
Content:
WHAT A LETDOWN!!!! I had it up and running for TWO days and the motherboard has failed. No reason for this, I have AVG as a security program, and have run that in my desktop for three years without a problem. Let me tell you about their Customer Service. Rude, not at all helpful, and spent almost the enitre conversation telling me what the COULD NOT do.
DO NOT BUY this product. I saw the negative review and chose to go with HP's solid rep. Well, it isn't the company it used to be, they are a real disaapointment. Now, I get to ship it all the way across the country for them to repair my BRAND NEW computer. This totally disgusted me and I will tell everyone I know to no longer support HP. They have gone the way of all of the other "big" companies, turning out junk and getting top dollar for it, and not supporting their product well. A BIG ZERO!

Title: NEVER BUY FROM ACE PHOTO & DIGITAL
Content:
In Sept '06 I purchased what should have been a new Electrolux Oxygen3 Ultra Canister model 7020A from Ace Photo & Digital in NYC.  It worked great until 1/5/07 - only 5 months old. Took it to an authorized Electrolux repair shop only to discover it had NO serial no. sticker on it's underside. Electrolux won't cover under their 1 yr warranty because this looks like I never had a NEW unit to start with.  I feel totally "taken" by Ace Photo for sending what appears to have been a used or rebuilt product, as it had no serial number sticker(hard to remove I'm told).  Amazon.com normally deals with reputable companies, but I definitely recommend that everyone (including Amazon) not do business with Ace Photo & Digital in Brooklyn,NY. This is an expensive loss from a bad experience of daring to risk purchasing a major item online.

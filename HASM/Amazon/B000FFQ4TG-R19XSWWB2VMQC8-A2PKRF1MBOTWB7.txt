Title: Consider the long term cost AND coffee quality
Content:
We just bought this Bunn coffee maker to replace one that had been in use for almost fifteen years.  We average two pots of coffee per day.  Prorate $100 over 15 years.  Not real expensive per year.  Our old Bunn failed because I didn't use common sense when handling it.  I picked up the unit by the upper plastic portion of the coffee maker when moving it for cleaning, etc.  With the water in the reservoir there's too much weight to pick it up that way.  This broke some of the  internal joints and caused leaking.  Be smarter than me...pick it up by the base or vertical center section when its full of water.  That's the main thing I wanted to say to those owning this coffee maker.  
The other reviewers have stated all the great features of Bunn coffee makers, so I won't detail them again.  This is our third Bunn and I wouldn't consider anything else.  Well.....to be honest, I was tempted to buy a Bunn commercial coffee maker like the VP17-1.  Good luck.

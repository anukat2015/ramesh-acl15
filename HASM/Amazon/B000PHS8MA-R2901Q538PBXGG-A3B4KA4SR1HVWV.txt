Title: best bang for the buck
Content:
Awesome mp3 player. Have had it since August 07 and it still rocks. Tiny size, a piece of cake to charge, absolutely easy to move mp3s into it as opposed to being FORCED to use itunes, etc. overall - a cheap, reliable and most of all quality product. i fill it with songs, connect it to my cars "auxillary audio input" jack and i now have like 240 songs to listen to. i haven't burned a CD in ages! =P 
i am by a computer all the time so charging via usb is no problem. and also - when you copy songs over - obviously it's via usb so i dont really see why people are complaining that they can only charge via usb. if anything, that's a plus! 
i have never had a time when the unit has died on me! i charge it / copy songs to it roughly every 3 or 4 days and use it for about a couple of hours each day and have not had the battery die on me. i dont know why people expect like 20 hours battery life of this little thing. 6 hours is good enough unless you're traveling to the middle of a third world country and there isn't a computer around for miles... :: rolling eyes :: if 7-8 hour battery life is too short, go and spend $300 on an ipod. 
anyway, i bought another one of these recently for a family member and they've been loving it since. seriously this is the best value for the dollar.

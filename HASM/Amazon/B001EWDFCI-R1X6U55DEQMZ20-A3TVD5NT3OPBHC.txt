Title: drawbacks of zune
Content:
# USB cable has a non-standard jack at the device end. Standard USB interface cables such as used by digital cameras and portable hard disk would make sense
# obscure software - had trouble installing on Windows XP. 
# could not find a way to use zune as a USB drive (as against creative's players) 
# device heavily tied with the software - restricts portability. 
overall not worth the hassle and price.

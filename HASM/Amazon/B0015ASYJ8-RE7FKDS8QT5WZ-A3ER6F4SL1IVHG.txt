Title: The world's smallest (and cheapest) digital SLR.
Content:
I bought this refurbished camera with the kit lens for $320 from Amazon/Adorama. It arrived in five days.
First, the bad news...
--Saying the E-420 is the world's smallest dSLR is like winning the prize for "the world's lightest 200 pound supermodel". This is not a small camera. Play with one before you buy it because there is no way this camera is fitting into any pocket. 
--Image quality is slightly soft (but can be turned sharp by turning off the noise filter).
--Very cramped viewfinder at about 50% magnification (apparent size of things is halved). In addition, critical info is places to the right of the viewfinder.
--Poor ergonomics between shutter, aperture, ISO via a single multifunctional dial. Please, Olympus, give us two dials.
--Somewhat slow autofocus in poor light (but very fast if you know what you're doing and read the helpful instructional manual).
--Poor resolution LCD but if you're like me you just use the LCD to check highlights then you won't care.
--No mechanical image stabilization. IS is most useful in the critical 1/4 to 1/125 shutter speed. I find myself there a lot so it would be nice to have.
--Compactflash only.
--Poor battery life at ~150 shots (but can be doubled with $10 aftermarket rechargeable).
Now for the good news...
--Its a real dSLR! You're just not going to find any dSLR at this price range and its build quality absolutely doesn't feel cheap.
--Smaller than any other dSLR. Other dSLR's feel enormous.
--100% viewfinder coverage? You take the picture and there's no cropping. You get what you see.
--Really good kit lens.
--Very fast operation...if you read the manual and practice. Otherwise, like most cameras of this sort, if you don't have a fundamental understand of the compromises between shutters speed, aperture, and ISO then the camera just pukes on you if you ask it to do something unreasonable.
--Smart flash with a great number of options. I'd still recommend a more powerful external flash (I use a tl20) for daylight photography.
--Super-fast and easy adjustable exposure compensation.
--Fast white-balance adjustment (but might take two button clicks and eyes off the prize to set it).
If you're getting into SLR photography and you don't want to spend a lot of money then this is the camera to get. This is not an easy camera to use but if you read the manual and practice with it then the camera is very fast. You can work really fast with the buttons...there's no delay at all.

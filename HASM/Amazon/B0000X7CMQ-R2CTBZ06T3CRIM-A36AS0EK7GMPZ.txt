Title: Simplicity - Excellent Pot of Coffee!
Content:
After looking at all of the "bells-and-whistle" coffee pots, we ended up buying this one.  We have had it a few days and already love it.  Simple to use, perfectly functional, and GREAT Coffee!  
Regarding the comments on the filter.... I guess I don't understand why people are having problems.  We just put in the gold-tone filter from our old pot and we were done.  Pefect fit.  Just get any standard gold-tone cone filter.  
Overall, we highly recommend this pot!

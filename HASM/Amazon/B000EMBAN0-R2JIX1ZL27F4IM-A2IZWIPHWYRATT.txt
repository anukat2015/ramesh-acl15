Title: Do not purchase this Devil!
Content:
I am soooo disappointed in this product.  It is bulky, has poor suction and overheats half way thru the job.  My home is 1600 sq feet and it stops from overheating before I can finish and most of the area is on laminate floor so stress on high pile carpet would not be a problem.  It takes about 45 min. for the Devil!! to recuperate.  I had an Oreck for many years and decided to go bagless.  I looked at Dyson and against my better judgement went to the Reaction.  That was a bad reaction on my part.  The belt situation for this vac is the only thing that sucks!  I am giving this machine away when the charity truck comes by next week.  I am going to get the Dyson ASAP.  Live and learn.  Run of the mill Hoover is better than this. Don't waste your money.

Title: The sound isn't good enough
Content:
You can't feel the bass. Apple has to improve iPod. Don't buy this one. Buy the 3rd gen. The nano 3rd gen's sound is TERRIFIC. That one (ipod nano 3rd gen) you can and should buy. The video is everything. Apple should recall all ipod nano 2nd gen and replace it with the 3rd gen.

Title: Good solid heater
Content:
We bought two of these at the beginning of the fall.  We use one in the kitchen and one in the living room.  They heat both spaces quite nicely, better if the door between the two areas is closed.
You can use a small box fan to circulate the heat if needed.
Just a little smell of oil to start out with but after the initial turning on, it's gone.

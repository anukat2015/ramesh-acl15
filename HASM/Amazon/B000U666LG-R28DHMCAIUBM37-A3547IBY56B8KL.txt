Title: Gives out sufficient heat.
Content:
I had bought this heater for a friend of mines that lives out in the desert. Thats the only means of heating they have. They use it to heat the bedroom that is about 13X16 ft and they were very happy with the results. They needed a heater that was compact and to where it would not be easily tipped over by animals.

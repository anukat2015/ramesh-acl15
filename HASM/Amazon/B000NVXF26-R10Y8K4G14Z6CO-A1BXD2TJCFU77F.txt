Title: Great value
Content:
After researching dslr's for over 6 months, I finally decided to go with the E-510 over the competition.  The picture quality is an absolute equivilant to similar cameras and the 510's features are a bit better.  The lens kit that comes with the camera is unmatched especially when compared with the competititon.  The only thing I find to be a bit frustrating is the 3 point focus, but it only hampers my shots in very dark settings.  Also, purshasing on amazon saved me at least 99 dollars compared to retail prices, go amazon!  dpreview is a great www site for research.  go there before you purchase any digital camera.  If you want a great value in the "prosumer" dslr, buy the 510, much more bang for the buck.

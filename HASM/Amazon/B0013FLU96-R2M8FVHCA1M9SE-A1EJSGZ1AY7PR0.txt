Title: Great for Business Travel
Content:
Fantastic Notebook.  Switched from PC, and what a joy.  The small learning curve is worth it.  This notebook is Quality.  Installed Parallels to run SolidWorks under Windows - and it works great in full screen mode.  Have been on the road with this notebook for nearly a month, and it is a joy.  So glad I am not traveling with my PC.

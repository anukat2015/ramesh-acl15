Title: great camera!
Content:
i got this camera prior to a trip overseas as well as to capture my 2 year olds faces. i was sick of "digital delay". it is awesome. it went around the world with me and held up great. at home, it works magic in getting the perfect snapshot. 
i love this camera. i wanted a nicer model- not a pocket camera. and i tried the tweener models at the store- the ones that dont have the delay in taking the picuture - but the manufacturers just moved the delay such that it takes a second or two to "save" to the memory card. this camera takes photos in quick succession so you can see them almost as if you were looking at a flipbook. it is awesome and just what i wanted.

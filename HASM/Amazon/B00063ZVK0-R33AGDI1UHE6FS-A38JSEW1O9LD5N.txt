Title: best heater yet
Content:
I have lived in a 30 foot travel trailer for 10 years.  I tell everyone I am a full time RVer.  My RV just doesn't go any where. (It could, but it doesn't) &lt;GRIN> Every year I buy a new heater looking for just the right one.  I HAVE FOUND THE RIGHT ONE - FINALLY!!!!!!!!!  This one is quiet and the thermostat is wonderful and it really heats and circulates the air so the trailer stays dry and mold free. That is important here in the Pacific Northwest so close to the ocean.

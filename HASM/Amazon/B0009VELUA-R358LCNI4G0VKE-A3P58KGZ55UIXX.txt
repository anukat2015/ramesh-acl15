Title: Could be more durable
Content:
This is my second Cusinart DCC-2000 in 4 years. The original started to act flaky (wouldn't energize, would quit in middle of brew, etc.). I read reviews of many people who have had similar and other problems. You might ask "Why in the world would you buy another?" Well, my 88 year old mother who loves coffee can not handle a carafe. There is only one other maker of carafe-less coffee makers and their reviews are poorer. This is the maker for you if you don't want a carafe, otherwise Mr Coffee is cheaper, more durable, and make the same quality cup.

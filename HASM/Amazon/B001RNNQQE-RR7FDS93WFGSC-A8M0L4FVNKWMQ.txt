Title: Avoid this coffee maker at all price
Content:
I usually don't spend time with reviews (I am generally satisfied with what I buy), and in fact this is one of the only reviews I have ever written. But this coffee maker just pushed my limits.
I almost did it yesterday morning when all the coffee went over the entire countertop. I thought, "hhmmmm", I have since a few people complaining about this, but this must be my fault. Well, it did it again this morning, after I paid attention to everything. I have owned coffee makers for 20 years. This is the first time I experience something like this. Please, be smarter than me, avoid this coffee maker.
UPDATE: We talked to Cuisinart. They said they would send a replacement part for the filter holder. Great!
Not! They sent the wrong item of course. If I could I would remove that one star I have on this item.
New Update: It's december 21, and the coffee went all over the place twice this week. Again, avoid. I wish we had returned it.

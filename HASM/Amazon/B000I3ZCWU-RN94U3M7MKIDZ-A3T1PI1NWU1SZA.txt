Title: Had the hardest time deciding...made the right choice.
Content:
If you're like me then you are having the hardest time deciding between the Nikon D40(X) and the Canon Rebel XTi. After reading a ZILLION reviews from both consumers and experts I finally decided to go with the Canon XTi. I have had my camera for a week now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. The bottom line is...I'm sure you'd be happy with either the Nikon or the Canon. But I can say, that if you do decide to get the Canon, you won't regret it! I know I don't.

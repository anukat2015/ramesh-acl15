Title: Why does Apple do this?
Content:
After spending nearly $250 on an MP3 Player I must ask why Apple feels the need to nickle and dime people to buy an FM player. Creative and Sandisk both include this.  However with an Ipod a $50 add on, clunky headphone is needed to get FM reception. 
Obviously Apple knows they could easily and inexpensively add this to their Ipods, but I suppose since Ipods are selling like hotcakes, they feel that they can slap the cost on to the consumer. 
I like the product overall but it does irk me that they do this, because in effect, Apple feels it can.

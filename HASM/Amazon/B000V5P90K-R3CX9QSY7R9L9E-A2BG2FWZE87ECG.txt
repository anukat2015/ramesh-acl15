Title: A Lot Of Bang For Your Buck
Content:
We've had this camera now for 7 full months and it's been a real joy to have.  I have not had an SLR camera since the late 70s, and my wife has never had one. Now she can't live without this thing!  
This camera just feels good in your hands and it responds well taking portraits, sport or landscape shots all with equal enjoyment.  Only negative, in my book, is the 1.6 crop factor.  I wish it was a full frame, but then the price would be about another $1,000.  
Did have an issue starting in the 5th month. The display was starting to jump around.  I would be reviewing a shot and the darned thing would start jumping into INFO on it's own.  It got progressively worse so I had to drop it off at the New Jersey repair center.  In 3 days I had it back, good as new.  They said something about a board coming lose.  No matter, they fixed it quickly and it's been fine ever since. 
I have bought additional lenses and I recommend only buying the Canon.  I had to send a Sigma telephoto back, it was just not useable and for nearly $600 I was not going to tolerate that performance.  Save a little longer and use that extra money to buy the Canons.  As my wife always says, "The cheap pay twice."

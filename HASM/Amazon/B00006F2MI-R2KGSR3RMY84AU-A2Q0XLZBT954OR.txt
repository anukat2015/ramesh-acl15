Title: Let's just say:  "I'm sending it back!"
Content:
A friend of mine has this same machine and likes it a lot - So I was very hopeful.  However, she's a TEA drinker, not a COFFEE drinker - that should have been a red flag!  Nothing against Tea Drinkers...we are just a different breed.
I'll try to make this short and sweet:
Pros:  It looks nice.
Cons: 
1. Coffee not very hot or strong.
2. Complete mess trying to clean all of the parts, which MUST be done for each pot of coffee (see #3). 
3. The grinder collects a lot of moisture from the steam.  This makes a horrific mess, you can't just rinse it out, you have to wipe it out, because the residue from the grind is caked onto everything.  This leads to then cleaning your sink and counter off after you have cleaned all of this out.
4. Grinder doesn't hold much coffee at all and there is only one setting for the grind: ON.  This doesn't give you much to work with in terms of making a pot of coffee that you like.
5. The filter basket pops out.  While this hasn't been a big problem in the week I've owned this machine, my first thought was: "that will probably be the first thing to break." 
6. Did I mention the coffee isn't that great?  I wouldn't say it was weak (like a tea), but it's not strong like I prefer. (See #4)
If you are a REAL COFFEE LOVER, don't waste your time!  If you pretty much just serve coffee to your friends on occasion - it's ok for the price.  But if that's the case, you might as well just pick up a $20 coffee maker at Target.

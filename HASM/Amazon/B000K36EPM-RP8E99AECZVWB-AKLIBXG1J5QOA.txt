Title: Excellent Coffee Maker
Content:
What we like best:
- the Thermal Carafe!
- auto shut-off (120 minutes)
- water measure can be view from the front! we are short so having to look inside the coffee maker just to pour water was a hassle on our old machine.
- off switch for sound! Finally! I'm sick and tired of all the kitchen devices beeping!
Overall very please! We drink more coffee (larger mugs) and more often! We need the energy to keep up with our children.
Challenge: a couple of times we made coffee without  first cleaning the carafe. We were very use to the visual or a clear glass carafe that you can easy see that it has some left over from last brew. Problem solved after a couple of accidents.

This is the 2nd Mr. Heater Big Buddy we have bought. We loved our first one so much we wanted to get another. My wife stays a little warmer than I do so I fire up my Big Buddy when I am cold. It is able to heat the whole room. I rarely turn it above low. These heaters are the very best thing to have for everyday use and especially when the power goes out!! I bought a hose so I can use it with my 20lb. tank in case I need to burn it for a long time if the power stays off for a while. Here, we lost power for 4 days at one time. These are a life saver. Don't take my word for it,,,,, try one for yourself.

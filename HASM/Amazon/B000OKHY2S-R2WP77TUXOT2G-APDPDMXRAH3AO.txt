Title: Portable Cooler/Swamp Cooler/Air Cooler
Content:
Well, it is portable.  And, it does stir the air about somewhat.  But cooler--I don't think so.
I have known about and used evaporative coolers dating back to the 1950's and they have generally been effective.  Although properly set-up, this unit does not provide anywhere near the same level of cooling I have seen in the past from "swamp coolers".  The technological advances in this process since the 1950's is completely underwhelming.  I would not advise purchasing this product unless you are interested in a fairly expensive fan.

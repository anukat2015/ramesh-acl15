Title: Can't open the carafe
Content:
The coffee maker is fine.  Cone filter basket, thermal carafe.  All good items.  BUT the lid on the carafe is very difficult to open.  The design is such that you are supposed to insert your fingers into the groove on the top of the lid and turn.  If you are a woman with FINGERNAILS, this can't happen. If you have arthritis or just weak hands, you are going to have to call for help to get this coffee out.
The main flaw in the design of this pot is the lid on the carafe.  If Mr. Coffee can come up with a lid that's easy to open, they'll have a great system here.

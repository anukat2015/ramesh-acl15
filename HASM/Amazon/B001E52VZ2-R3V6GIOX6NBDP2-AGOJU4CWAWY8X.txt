Title: it sucks
Content:
I wanted a light weight, powerful vacuum with HEPA filter and dust collecting bag.  This vac works well for my house, since I have no carpet but wood floor and vinyls where all the dust collects in the corners.  I use the "Bear Claw" for my small wool space rags, and works very well.  I wanted the light, small vacuume to carry to the basement and to the second floor.  I am able to get all the dust bunneis on each stairs at corners where Swiffers can't get.  The weight of this vacuum is a charm for the stairs, windows and door frames and shelves.  I also wanted HEPA filters since I have four cats, and want to keep the indoor air as clean as possible for my children when I vacumm.  I also wanted the dust collecting bag, since I can not imagin how to keep the bagless canister clean, and the need to open the canister outside in a cold winter.  I like the idea of keeping the dust in a bag and toss it when full.  I like some of the attachments are on board, with long hose that is crushproof.  The only thing I wished it had was an automatic cord coil for better storage.

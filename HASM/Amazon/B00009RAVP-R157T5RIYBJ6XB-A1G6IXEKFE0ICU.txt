Title: Absolutely thrilled!
Content:
FANTASTIC PRODUCT. Need I say more? I agree with everything the other five-star reviewers have written.
 I received mine today and plugged it in... Its like a miniature sun in your home, its super quiet, extremely light to carry, efficient, the oscillating feature is just great, its very modestly price for how good it is & above all, its heats like a dream, I have not even used the 800W yet as im still loving the 400W.
The glow it emits is just so calming, just like standing infront of direct sunlight on a cold day... heats you beautifully.
I could not be happier.

Title: better than expected
Content:
I was pleasantly surprised at this vacuum! Ease of use is the first thing that I'd have to say, plus I love the feature of extending the wand when vacuuming, I am tall, and hate having to stoop over with other vacuums, it make this the most comfortable vacuum I've ever used!  Also great for reaching high places when you have the attachments in use.
The cleaning overall was superior, great suction, I just finished cleaning the carpets with my nearly brand new Hoover and was amazed at how much more this Electrolux picked up!
This vacuum is also amazingly quiet, my big old yellow lab nearly looses his doggie mind when I start up the vacuum, but this one is so quiet that he only walked over to sniff it out, then went back to living his sleepy dog's life!
Would absolutely recommend!

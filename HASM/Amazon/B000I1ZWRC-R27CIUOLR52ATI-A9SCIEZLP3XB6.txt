Title: This is simple...
Content:
If you like to go into amateur/pro photography, buy a DSLR with good glass. If you are not into doing stuff and you just want to take good pictures, easy carry and that the camera does everything for you, then buy a point and shoot.
Really hate when people start giving negatives about DSLR's or Point and Shoots when they really don't know that you can't put a Compact/Mid sized car in a race with a Ferrari F1. Logically, if you have never driven a Ferrari F1, in the beginning you are going to have awful results! Hope this helps although no technical things are explained!

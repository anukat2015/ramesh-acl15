Title: An Electronic Lemon
Content:
Coming out of the box, Creative Zen 16GB MP3 Player puts on quite an impressive show. This model is complimented with a brilliant color screen, crystal clear sound, SD card slot, FM radio, voice recorder and user friendly EQ. Like most models in this line, it only comes in black.
This unit supports a vast array of WMA, WAV, ADPCM, Audible, MP3, AAC. In video mode battery life clocked in at about 5 hours. Audio lasted for about 20 hours. PIM function will allow for the syncing of calendar, appointments, etc; via Outlook. FM radio offers auto scan with 32 preset slots.
All in all this WAS the perfect and probably the most complete player on the market. If it had not been for other problems raising their ugly head I could have easily overlooked the sticky and very cheap control pad. In short, after a few months of perfect sound and video the system simply locked up. No video, no music, no nada.
Phone tech support with Creative Labs is not what it is cracked up to be. Sending in the unit for diagnostics and repair was a month long ordeal with limited results at best. Once returned, the player worked for a awhile until the same evil gremlin raised its ugly head.
After repeated attempts at resolving this problem with an almost non-existent customer support center, I was informed the item was no longer under warranty and that I would have to foot the bill for any future repairs. The Creative Zen 16GB Mp3 Player would have been an outstanding purchase if it had only operated for at least one year before biting the dust. Bottom line is, I am left with a very overpriced paper weight.

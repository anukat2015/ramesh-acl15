Title: The Best Camera in its class
Content:
This is the best camera in its class.Canon Digic III processors are made in Japan and are used in the EOS ID Mark III professional camera, while Nikon processors are made in China. Only the  Nikon cameras that cost  over $1,500 processors are made in Japan.Why do Nikon do this?  Also the image stabilizer is built in the lens which is a better philosophy.  This camera has 12 mp and a live view. WoW!!!!

Title: Does the job for a small room
Content:
I bought this heater for my daughter's room.  It works great and I don't have to worry about her being cold at night when she kicks off her blankets.  The temperature control keeps the room from getting too hot and it's ceramic, so you can touch it and not get burned.  But when I tried using it in our living room (which is quite large), it didn't seem to make a difference.  So, this little heater is great for small rooms, especially for the price!

Title: Great for the money.
Content:
This is the second sandisk mp3 player that I have bought. The first is still working fine after more than a year, and this one has worked fine so far. I'm not sure how it's features compare to other mp3 players, but after a little practice I've figured out how to use the thing. And this is in spite of the fact that I was a complete novice when I bought my first one. It comes with a free media converter for videos which is pretty easy to use. My kids especially like them for the videos that they get to watch. The slot for extra memory is also a cool feature.

Title: Good heater, Bad controls
Content:
It works well and is a small size. It's not too noisy.
BUT, the dial controls have NO notations on them. They do not match the manual so I have no idea how to setup the option to keep from freezing. They are just dials with notches on them.
The other thing I don't like is that it doesn't turn off, off. It seems like you can only turn off the heat switch, but the fan can still be active.

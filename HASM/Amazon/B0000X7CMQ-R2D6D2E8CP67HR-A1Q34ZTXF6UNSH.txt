Title: 7 Month Lifespan
Content:
I was reasonably happy with this product until it expired in it's 7th month.  Still under warranty, yes, but their terms require you to ship the product to one of just a few 3rd party repair shops.  You must also pay them shipping and handling to ship the product back to you after they have obtained parts and hopefully fixed it.
$30 worth of shipping to fix a $50 coffee maker is hardly what I would call a warranty.
Yes, it did make very good coffee.  But the carafe lid sticking between the closed and pour positions (you have to twist it) was truly aggravating.

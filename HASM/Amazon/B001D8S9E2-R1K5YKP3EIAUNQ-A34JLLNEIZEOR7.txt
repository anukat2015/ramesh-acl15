Title: Simple the Best!
Content:
I've used PCs for about 15 years... when I switched to Mac, one year ago; I couldn't believe what I was missing! Best damn OS ever! I love the stability, the easy of use, the clean design, ALL is just perfectly design.
Before this new MacBook, I had the black MacBook, and the improvements are great! The display is awesome. Don't pay attention to those complaining about the reflections, that happens with all glossy displays, not only this new mac. The improvements on graphics performance are outstanding!. The unibody really makes the computer lighter, more robust, and it really runs cooler! I haven't even heard the fan turning on as it did with the black macbook. The track pad with gestures is just amazing too! Oh and the illuminated keyboard... incredibly necessary when working at night.
The only thing I might complain about is the lack of other peripherals ports. Only two usb ports might be not enough for some people. In my case that all I'll ever need.

Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
I've had the Oxygen for about 4 years now. I spent a lot of time researching before making the purchase, and thought I'd made a great choice.We have all hardwood floors and two area rugs. Within the first few months the tool caddy broke off so I never really used any of the attachments. The power head for carpet is great and I felt it was doing a nice job of cleaning the carpets...however, just as the warranty expired, within weeks it seemed, the power head stopped working. I took it to a local repair shop and the connectors in the wand had blown (melted plastic, as other reviewers noted.) It cost around $110 to replace this part. The hardwood floor brush is just OK, it almost seemed like it was for a different vacuum...I found it kept falling off in the beginning and was a bit awkward to use. Anyway, long story short, the power head has stopped working again. This time I was told it's the electric hose...another $90. I'm on the fence between ditching the vacuum completely and purchasing something new like the Panasonic MC-CG885....or spending the money and hoping I get another couple of years out of the Oxygen. Hmmmmm. It is pretty good when it works, but beware of costly repairs. The guy at the vacuum shop said Electrolux are some of the worst vacuums, they are basically designed to break...fatally flawed... Somehow the pretty design and featured wooed me 4 years ago.

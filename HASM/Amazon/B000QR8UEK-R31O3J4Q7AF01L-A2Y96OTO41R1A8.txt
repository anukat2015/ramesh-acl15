Title: Great little space heater
Content:
I've owned this model for a few years now and I've been very happy. I've used this heater to save on utility bills by keeping the house thermostat low and using this to deliver spot heat in just the rooms I use.  This forced-air heater will blow warm air quite a long distance and really circulates the air well.  If you are looking for a unit that can heat a room efficiently, this is your product.  If you use a heater under your desk to keep your legs warm this will do well. You will want to locate the heater somewhere behind you and point it where you want the heat.

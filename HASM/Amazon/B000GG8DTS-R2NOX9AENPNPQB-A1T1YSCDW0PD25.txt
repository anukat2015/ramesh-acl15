Title: Great little heater, but know what you're getting
Content:
This is a great little heater if you realize that it's only 300 watts and only emits heat in one direction.
Pros:
* Small
* Quiet - no fan
* Inexpensive
* Simple to use
* Direct heat in one direction - not omnidirectional
* Only 300 watts (good if you don't want a lot of heat)
* Safety switch on bottom in case unit tips over
Cons:
* Only 300 watts (bad if you want more heat)
* Only two settings - off and on - but this makes it very simple
Other:
* At "only" 300 watts, don't expect this thing to put out as much heat as a 500, 750, or 1500 watt heater

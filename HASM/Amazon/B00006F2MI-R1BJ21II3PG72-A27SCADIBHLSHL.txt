Title: This Coffee Maker is a Lemon
Content:
Maybe I just got the lemon of the bunch or maybe the others wrote their review before they owned it for a week.  I bought the more expensive chrome version.Anyhow, worked fine for 1st week.  Then coffee started to overflow around the basket and missed the carafe - made a mess.  Problem is that the coffee cannot seem to filter quickly enough through the basket with a filter when you make a more than a 7-cup pot of coffee.  The basket is a mesh filter-like container which makes a paper filter optional.   But if you do not use the paper filter small coffee grounds are let through.Another problem is that the 'pause' feature, that is when you remove the carafe to get a cup while it is still brewing, does not work at all.  You pull the carafe away and it continues to drip.I am sending my coffee maker back, and as an aside, Amazon's return polices are great and hassle-free. (first time I have ever had to return anything to Amazon).

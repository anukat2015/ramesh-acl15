Title: Died almost immediately, BUT......
Content:
I was very enthusiastic when this machine showed up at home.  Very light and very brilliant picture.  The next day, while kicking back feeling pretty content and surfing for accessories, it died.  Hmmm.....
I called up SONY and after jumping through all the normal hoops of button pressing and holding sessions I was connected with an operator who talked me through the troubleshooting process.  I was not able to complete the troubleshooting that time but when I called back to continue, expecting the same hoop-la, I was amazed to find myself fast-tracked to an actual operator.  The system recognized my phone number and that I had called recently.  As I had suspected I was not able to recover the machine and my contact information was taken for referral to a local representative.
To my surprise, within 2 business days I had a call from the local person and the next day he made the repairs at my office. I was extremely impressed with this process and even though the machine died the day after I got it I was so impressed with the process I would buy another if the need were present.
Buy this machine, it's great and the support couldn't be better.

Title: First Toshiba, very happy, perfect!!
Content:
I just received this laptop a few days ago. Wow, the monitor is huge! The laptop itself is gorgeous and shiny! I'm not a computer expert, I just want everything to run without problems and run quickly.
I was frustrated with the wireless going off and on every few minutes. I finally figured out that although the product info say it runs with 802.11 a/b/g/n, the laptop itself and the info says it runs with a/g/n, NO B. I might be wrong, but I got a new G router (compatible with my kids' older laptops), and WOW, this laptop is FAST! 
I also do a lot of documents, spreadsheets, access, and powerpoint for my classes, as well as play online games. I can have all of my work open, along with several websites, and play my games (on my break, of course) and everything works superfast.
As a computer amateur, I just want something that will plug and play with very little help from me. This was exactly what I needed! The only thing I did was uninstall the programs that I didn't need when I first received it.
Oh, and those speakers, my kids were in awe at the sound that came from those little built-in speakers when I went on to YouTube to show them some cool 80's rock!

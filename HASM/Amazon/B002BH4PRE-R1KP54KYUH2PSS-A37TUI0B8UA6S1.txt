Title: Durability
Content:
HP does not honor their warranty.  After six months the screen failed and showed many lines and some black areas.  This was just for normal operation of opening and closing the screen led.  No force or pressure applied on the screen or lid to open and close.  If you don't hold on the places that HP has not identified, you may crack the internal LCD components.  It is simply a poor quality design for expected operation.  HP blames it on the customer and does not honor their product quality.  After paying for replacement part plus labor, it will still be the same poor quality component.  Failure as the result of poor design for durability is blamed as damaged by consumer (operator).  I recommend Dell or Toshiba for much sturdier and well built design.  Would you accept this on your car warranty if the door wouldn't function and breaks after six months of normal use without any accident?  HP expects the consumer pays for their poor development.  Dealing with HP's ill-mannered customer services is another big disadvantage.  Would you take this risk for your new purchase?

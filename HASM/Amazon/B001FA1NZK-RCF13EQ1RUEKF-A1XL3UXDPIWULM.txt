Title: This actually is a fun product with functionality
Content:
This is a very simple and fun pda to use.  I like the easy connection to the internet using wifi.  I now read the paper, get up to date weather, tv and movie listings,  daily on my ipod - all with a touch of a colorful icon on the screen.  Easy to record shopping lists, count calories, read books by downloading the free apps available right to the ipod.

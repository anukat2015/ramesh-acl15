Title: Great product

I bought this for my daughter for her birthday in June. She loves it. I have barely touched it. She set it up and I have not had to help her at all. She is [...] This is simple to get music onto and simple to use. We did purchase a skin for it after reading so many reviews about scratches. It makes it look really cool, and it is a different color from her friends' so that's great. 
I do agree about battery life not being anywhere near 14 hours. It seems she charges it almost every day and she does not use it nonstop. For the steep price I think it should have come with a charger because I don't like having it hooked to the computer so often, but that is minor.

Title: leaks coffee all over the counter
Content:
My wife bought me this to replace the last cuisinart I had, one that made warm coffee and leaked all over the counter.  This model makes hotter coffee, which is nice.  But after about two weeks of use I see that this coffee maker too is leaking coffee on my countertop.  That is UNACCEPTABLE.  
After owning two of their coffee makers, and both having the same problem, I see that cuisinart doesn't care about their product.  Many many reviews have pointed out that their coffee makers leak.  Yet nothing has been done.  A bit of QA testing would have caught this design flaw.  Obviously, that hasn't taken place.
I'm going to return it for a different coffee maker, but I'll never have another Cuisinart coffee maker.

Title: Okay, I suppose...
Content:
When I got this MP3, it worked great, I got it playing music the first day. But, a few years later, I think they were two, it started to get lines in the screen. My big brother told me that means its dying. I was so upset. I loved it. But it works fine, but I can't bear to think that in any moment it will die. 
My dad has one and has had no problem with it. I think it won't die if you use it everyday. My dad uses it everyday and it's perfect. I hadn't used it for about two or three months, and, like I mentioned, suddenly it had lines in the screen.
Beside that, It's wonderful! You can change the background that's cool. I really enjoyed it but I don't like that it's dying.

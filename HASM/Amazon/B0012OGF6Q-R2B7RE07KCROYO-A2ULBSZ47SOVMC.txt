Title: Great DSLR
Content:
I purchased this camera from Amazon about ten months ago.  Even though that much time has passed, I still haven't mastered all of the functions of this camera.  Admittedly, I consider myself to be a novice.  I got this camera as an upgrade from my Canon S2 IS which offered a lot of functionality over a typical compact digital camera but not as much as I wanted.  The D60 gives me the same creative freedom that I once enjoyed from my old 1990's Canon T60 SLR (told you I was novice!).  
If you are purchasing this camera as an upgrade from a point and shoot, I suggest shooting in Manual mode, aperture priority, or shutter priority once you familiarize yourself with the controls.  Shooting in one of these three modes can really give you great results.
My only gripe is the focus ring on the 18mm-55mm kit lens.  It's way too small.  When I've switched to manual focus, it just feels weird having such a small area to grip.  Maybe that's typical for autofocus lenses, I don't know.  My only other SLR experience did not have autofocus.
One last tip: turn off the auto review option!  It's very frustrating to take a shot then get ready to take another and you're in review mode for a few moments.
Overall, though, I am very happy with this camera and I would definitely recommend it.

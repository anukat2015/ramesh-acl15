Title: heater does the job intended
Content:
We replaced a space heater for our back bedroom, 11' x 13' in size. This heater is filling the need perfectly. It has a choice of 3 heat settings. We have it set on the lowest wattage and it is providing enough heat for our needs. We especially like the programmable on/off timer. You move pegs in towards the center of a 24 hour dial to indicate a 15 minute period the heater is to be on. So we heat the room only as needed... from 7-11pm and then on again 4-8am. Couldn't be happier with the unit.

Title: Zune Vs. Ipod
Content:
OK, SO i bought a Zune to get something different from the common ipod. In short, huge mistake; I can't stand the softwere on this thing, I really tried to deal with syncing problems and non-verisility of the softwere. In the end i sold it on amazon and bought an ipod touch with so amazingly better, not as much storage, but is way better than any zune.

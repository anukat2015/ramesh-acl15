Title: This product is hot.
Content:
I love this product.  Slick, smart design.  The click wheel is very usable, although it prevents the Mini from obtaining the &quot;no moving parts&quot; solidity of the big brother.  The 4 GB capacity is ok.  I wish I could carry everything, but iTunes is darn good at getting the songs I want onto the pod.  The smart playlists let you tackle whatever logic you want for picking the songs to synch.  This is my first Apple anything, and so far it interoperates well with XP.  NO COMPLAINTS.  But it should have come with the armband and docking station.  Stop being cheap, Apple.

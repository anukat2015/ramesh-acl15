Title: Outstanding little laptop!
Content:
I first read about the Acer AS1810 in "a leading consumer magazine" (C.R.) where it received high marks for performance. I've had my laptop - the nicely done Olympic edition - about two weeks and have been very happy with it. Programs launch quickly, web browsing is fast and easy (even with downloading large video files), and the touchpad is the best I've ever used - I especially like the `press and scroll' (my own term) feature to scan pages. The large keys provide a good sense of touch, and the display is great. Did I mention that's its lightweight and has 8+ hours of battery life? An outstanding little computer!

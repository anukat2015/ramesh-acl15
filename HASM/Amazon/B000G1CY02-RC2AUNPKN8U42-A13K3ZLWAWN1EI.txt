Title: Quiet, hot, safe- NOT anymore!
Content:
This can be wall mounted, it heats up very quickly, and it's 99.5% silent.  The heat it generates is soft and cozy. The cats like it, too. I do not regret buying this and will probably get another soon. It raised the temp in a 14x22 room over 5 degrees in about an hour, from around 62 degrees to 68.
The sound is so minimal it will not disturb you unless you are used to living in the backwoods!  The other reviewer above is nitpicking. It makes a little knocking sound when it starts as the panel is heating up. It's not going to wake you or the baby or the dog or the neighbors or your roommate. It's so quiet I forget that it's on and wish it had a timer to shut off automatically. A crackling fire makes a lot more noise!
Addendum: 08/08  worked fine and quietly all last season as well as year prior. Cuts the chill.
2nd Addendum 11/08:  A unit I purchased for someone else about 1.5 years ago, and which received light use, started to short out.  The panel threw sparks and appeared to be arching.  A call to the customer service center said it was normal..... NORMAL?!?!  It was a serious fire hazard and the unit was tossed.  Not only a bummer, but customer service was useless in this situation and could have been potentially fatal if we listened to the excuses.  If you feel your unit is not working properly.... don't use it.  1 star for poor poor customer service.
3rd  addendum:  04/09 Second unit purchased is malfunctioning like the first unit.  If your unit is doing the same thing, please contact Delonghi and let them know as well as the U.S. consumer product safety commission.

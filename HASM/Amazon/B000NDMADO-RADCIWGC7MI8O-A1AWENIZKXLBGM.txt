Title: don't judge a book by it's cover
Content:
When this came yesterday, the interior box was in very rough shape. The vacuum (dyson 21 stowaway) had obviously been packed in a used box - and we all know what that means. I very, very carefully checked the machine for signs of use, considering that I had purchased it new. There were a few minor scuffs on the power head, but overall, it appeared to be brand new. With some misgivings (I had waited a while to purchase this), I finally started it up and gave it a try.
This vacuum works great. I am very pleased with the performance. The hose is sturdy, the cord tucks away (and it is long enough for me to go across an entire room), it pushes comfortably without a huge effort, and the wand  is great for cleaning the bathroom fan vent, etc. It fits under the bed with little effort (unlike my upright). It pulls dirt just fine.
I went from wanting to send it back RIGHT NOW to not wanting to part with it, ever. It works great. I would buy this product for friends (if they wouldn't get insulted that I gave them a vacuum, I mean, c'mon.). I really like it. I can't wait to clean my car next!

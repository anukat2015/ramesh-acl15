Title: Excellent percolator for the price
Content:
If you are a coffee lover this is the product for you.  Fresh percolated coffee in less time than it takes to brew a pot with a drip-type coffee brewer.  I had forgotten how good percolated coffee tastes.  The stainless steel ensures there is no unpleasent plastic after-taste with your cup of java.  Easy clean up too.  Keep the grounds out by either using a filter design for a percolator or by getting the smaller drip filters and pushing the center of the filter through the percolator's tube.  Worth every penny of the price.

Title: Rotating brush stopped working after five months
Content:
This vacuum worked well initially after purchase. However, after about five months of cleaning (and I don't clean that often!) the rotating brush or agitator stopped rotating.  I took it apart, slipped the drive belt back into place -- and it worked for less than five minutes before the belt came off again!
Without that brush rotating, this vacuum does not clean very well.

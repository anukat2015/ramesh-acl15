Title: Macbook Pro is powerful and simple to use
Content:
I've had the Macbook pro for about a month now.  Was a PC user up until now.  I'm sold on how easy the Mac is to use.  I especially like Iphoto for organizing pictures, Imovie for video clips, and even garageband for creating music and laying voice over onto karaoke songs.   All software maintains a similar look and format and is very simple to navigate. And - when you have nothing to do, taking goofy pictures with Photo Booth is fun.

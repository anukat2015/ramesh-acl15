Title: Nikon D40 - Excellent value for the money
Content:
I've been away from photography for many years and decided to get back into it. 
After a fair amount of research, bought a D40 and a couple of basic 'toys' to go with it.
A value for the money machine like this is very rare. 
Most machines are commanding a higher price, and justify it by 
adding 'features/gimmicks' that are of no interest or are of questionable value to my style of photography.
I was impressed enough that after seven months I just bought another for a backup. 
Sadly, the D40 is being replaced - and I don't see another unit that matches its price/performance.
Very good image 'out of the box', even better with minor 
post-processing with a freeware editor such as Irfanview.
I can usually nitpick something to pieces, but it's very 
hard to find any major faults with the way I use it.
All in all, a very nice machine - and at Amazon's latest price, an excellent value.

Title: Works Well
Content:
I haven't used the coffee maker much yet, but it works well.  The one issue I have with it is that you have to manually turn it off.  I would rather it shut off automatically once it's brewed since it doesn't have a warming plate like a regular coffee maker does.  I don't use the steamer since I don't like foam, so I don't know how well that works.

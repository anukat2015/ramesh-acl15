Title: Best portable media device ever made.
Content:
This new IPOD touch 64gb is by far the best media/portable internet device on the market.  Apple is well known for making quality products in pretty much every field: hardware, computer systems, Ipod's, laptops, you name it and it's quality with Apple.  This Ipod has a wonderful touch screen that is very responcive, clear, responds to movements, and has very crisp control unlike the Zune touch.  The features on the Ipod touch are a dream, it's like having a tiny mac computer with all your video's, audio etc in your pocket.  Fastest processor available for these type of devices, Safari works very fast and is by far the best browser available today, easy email checking/alerts, messenger, app store for endless apps, itunes store for buying music/video on the go, world clocks, notes, the best music/video/pic file organization I have seen, huge storage in the 64GB memory and google maps which gives you a portable GPS thats easy to use and program all right in your pocket.  This is by far the best portable device I have ever owned, flawless and worth every penny.  Forget the Zune touch it's garbage and only works with windows, the IPOD touch has a larger, clearer screen, apps, more games and way better design quality and durability than any Zune.  Awesome job Apple, very happy customer.

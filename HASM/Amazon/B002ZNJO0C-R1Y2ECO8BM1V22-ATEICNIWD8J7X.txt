Title: Pleasantly Surprised
Content:
Sadly, my fireplace was shipped without a piece, the bracket to hold the glass panel in. The panel still fits snug, and until I get the piece from Customer Service, it seems to stay in place fine anyway. The flame effect is surprisingly,very good. I did not expect it to be as life-like as it turns out. The heater is very quiet, and actually warms both my living room and dining room, an area approximately 30 x 15, to a comfortable degree. I agree with the poster above that a separate setting for the thermostat and flame would have been great. Also, since it is RF, it doesn't work with my Harmony One remote, but the remote is small and only has an "on" and an "off" button. One strange thing, I looked on the Dimplex site, and can not find this model. Even if it was a closeout, shouldn't they still list the model?

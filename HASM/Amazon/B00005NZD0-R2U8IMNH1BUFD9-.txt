Title: A bit disappointing
Content:
It does make espresso and coffee and both taste quite decent, but they're not quite hot enough.  And the the frother leaves a bit to be desired too.  I'm disappointed by the lack of measurement markings on the coffee caraffe.  So it works, but it's not as good as I expected.  I had a Krups coffee maker for years that was the best ever and I suppose I'm disappointed because I expected that sort of quality from this machine too.

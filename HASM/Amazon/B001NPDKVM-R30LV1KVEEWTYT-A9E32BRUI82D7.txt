Title: fantastic notebook for under 600 full featured too
Content:
Compaq Presario CQ60-210US
Pros: While touted as a sub notebook this offering full of features. The screen is bright crisp. Has a media slot. This offering also plays wow and lord of the rings online well. It manages some sim games as well as roller coaster tycoon well. While i would not expect it to manage graphic intensive newer games , it does manage some what dated games very well
watched a movie recently with the dvd player. It was very easy . Just put the dvd in, and media player reconized it instantly .This does play movies well and at this point this is primarly what i am using it for 
Cons: Short battery life ( under 2 hours). 3 usb slots, no hdmi ( tv out put) no web cam
The outside of lap top is shiney black and a finger print magnet. Some might prefer to keep clear plastic sheet on it to deal with that
Summary: Very surprised at all the features and the fact with the 256 meg video that it handles some games very well. I had a net book . This was a better choice for me
 Found it at stapples for 399.00 with mail in [...] from hp
 warning it does not come with product recovery disks. However for about 16.00 you can order it on line or use phone support and get them to mail a product recovery disk to you
update; a cooler fan for this unit is a must otherwise it gets way to hot.This unit is loud ( fan) 
 a little over a month use of vista the laptop is now being used as a print sever. A bit of buyers remorse, not adapting to vista well. A decent machine for a decent price

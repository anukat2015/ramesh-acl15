Title: Canister vacuum lover
Content:
My Hoover of 8 years cracked in the handle so it was time to look for a new one.  I borrowed a friends Dyson upright as she raved about it, but I didn't like the bulkiness of it, being used to a canister for so many years.  In addition, I needed something that readily reached under furniture, which was not easy with the upright.  I then began my research and ended up with the Hoover again.  I appreciate its light weight, the extension handle,tools, and maneuverability.  Not ever having adjustable suction, I find this to be one of my favorite features.  Others have complained about the plastic features but I find it to be somewhat sturdy and feel it will last for many years.

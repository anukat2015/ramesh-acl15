Title: I'm happy with my Olympus Evolt 510
Content:
After a month of having this camera, i'm very happy with it. I bought the 2 lens kit. Both lenses work really well and the images are super sharp. I haven't really used all the settings yet but the auto function works pretty well. The live view can sometimes give you a blurry result but i'd rather use the view finder. The only complaint i have is that now that i have the camera i want more lenses and the choices are slim compared to Nikon and Canon. Otherwise it's a great product.

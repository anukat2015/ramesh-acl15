Title: I love this vacuum!
Content:
This machine actually makes me want to vacuum my house!  Besides being very sleek looking and lightweight, it has incredibly strong suction and picks up things that you can't see while doing the job.  I love the fact that it is bagless, and dust can be emptied out after each use.  The attachments that come with it that are most used fit neatly onto one of the handles.  I also love the fact that the cord automatically recoils into the machine when you are finished with vacuuming.  I would most highly recommend this product.  It is wonderful that you can now order an electrolux vacuum directly through Amazon.

Title: This vacuum is fabulous!
Content:
We have had this vacuum for 3 weeks and continued to be amazed.  It has great suction and picks up our cat hair with no problem.  I love the compactness, lightness and the telescoping wand.  The only drawback I have noticed is the shortness of the cord.  I can't even get across my living room without unplugging it and replugging.  If you can live with that, this is the machine to have.  I tested a lot of vacuums before purchasing this far more expensive Dyson, and this is by far the one to own.

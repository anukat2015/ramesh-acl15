Title: Forget the Ipod video.
Content:
This little baby is better than the ipod video, not a whole lot better, but it is still better and cheaper too boot.
Pros
-colorful menus
-customizable themes
-set images as wallpaper
-delete files directly on there without having to hook it to the computer
-excellent video quality
-excellent sound quality
-easy to use interface
-voice and sound record
-radio
-acts as and organizer and note taker
-creative's software is much easier than itunes, and it takes any file format (also because it has an easy to use file converter)
-you dont have to pay to convert certain files (like the office, which you have to pay to convert with itunes)
-sleek, don't let people tell you its too chunky compared to the ipod. I prefer its more solid design anyhow.
Cons
-the battery life could be longer for the video, im not sure how it compares to the ipod video battery life though
-Ipod users may dislike the scroll wheel, but once you get used to it (which doesnt take long) it's very easy to use.
-no wall charger, needs to be hooked to computer to charge, unless you buy a separate one.
Final Note
this is a great gift for anyone this christmas, definitly a better buy than the ipod video.

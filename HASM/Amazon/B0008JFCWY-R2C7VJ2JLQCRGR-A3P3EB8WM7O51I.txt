Title: Amazing player!!!
Content:
I got this player for Christmas and it is great.  The player is about the size of a lighter and has a mirror-like surface.  I have had NO problems with the software.  As soon as I plugged the player into the computer it was ready to go.  There is a drag-and-drop program so you don't have to deal with Sonic Stage.  I tried using Sonic Stage and I didn't have a problem with it at all.  None of my music had to be converted to be put on the player like some people complain about.  The sound quality is great! The volume is quite loud, I keep it at half of the maximum volume.  The earbuds that come with it suck, but I already figured that and used ones that I liked.  I wish you were allowed to put songs back onto your computer from the player.  The buttons for the search and display are tiny.  Overall this player is great and I'm very glad that I got it.

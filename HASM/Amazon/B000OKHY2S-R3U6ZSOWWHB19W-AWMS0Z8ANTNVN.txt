Title: Great cooler for a reasonable price
Content:
This cooler works pretty well, all in all. 
The only downside is that it starts smelling after a couple of weeks. To fix this we need to drain all the water inside it, and then dry the tank. This involves unscrewing the back of the cooler & some manipulation to dry the space.
Being the man of the house, guess who's job it is....

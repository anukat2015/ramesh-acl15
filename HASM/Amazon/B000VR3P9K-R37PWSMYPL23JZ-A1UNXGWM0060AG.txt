Title: Photoshop Dream Machine Laptop
Content:
Exceptional laptop. Silent, cool & fast using Photoshop/Warcraft/DVD burning. My MacBook never froze once in 4+ years w/ not one virus even without protection software, so I jumped for another Mac laptop.
Wanted the dual graphics cards. The newest 15" MBP Uni (June, 09) doesn't have the external expansion port like this one has (for eSATA) - the 17" MBP is too big to carry around, so I opted to buy this one based not on its close-out discount, but FEATURES. 
Further, this model has the last of the owner-replaceable batteries on MacBook Pro, and I don't like to pay someone to replace a battery. 
Recommendation: Keep an eye out for this model Used when they quickly sell out. Cannot figure out why Apple didn't just keep all its connectivity features & dual graphics cards that this machine has. I may upgrade memory & hard drive in time, but it doesn't really need it even using Photoshop's memory-hog features. There's no delay time!!!

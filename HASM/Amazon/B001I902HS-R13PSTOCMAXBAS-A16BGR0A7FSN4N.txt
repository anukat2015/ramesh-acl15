Title: Really Happy with it!
Content:
Bought this vacuum because I owned one similar to it in years past and really liked it. Was looking for a light weight canister. My last vac. was a Dyson and although it picked everything up, it was too heavy and cumbersome for me. I also am not a fan of bagless vac's since they tend to get so dirty and need to be taken apart to clean so frequently. This vacuum picks up all the pet hair (2 dogs, 3 cats) and everything else. It's SO much easier to manuveur and goes under the bed easily. I really like the bags. Yeah, they're still more money than a bagless, but they've got filters built in and I feel like the air in my house is cleaner after using them (always felt that there was dust in the air from the Dyson). Very happy with my purchase!

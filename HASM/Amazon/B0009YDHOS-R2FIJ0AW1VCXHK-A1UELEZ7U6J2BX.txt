Title: needs frequent brew seal replacement
Content:
We have been enjoying a cup of Capuccino every single morning for at least 9 years. Our old model broke and needed to be replaced. We chose the Krups XP 4000 based on it's 15 bar pump setting and because our previous very old machines were from Krups and we were happy with them.
What a dissapointment! Yes, it works, but the pump is very LOUD. The biggest problem is that the Brew Head seal needs to be replaced frequently (part 620342). 
We got our machine in May 2006 and make 2 cups each morning. We are at our 3rd (!) seal; that's a seal replacement roughly every couple months. One needs a very short srewdriver to do this. I would never buy this machine again, wish I never had and regret I didn't return it when I still could.

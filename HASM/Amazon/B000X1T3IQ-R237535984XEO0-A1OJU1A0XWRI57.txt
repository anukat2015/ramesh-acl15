Title: TACK SHARP!!
Content:
What a wonderful camera!  It's a litte pricey, but the first time you use it will validate the money spent.  This is my first dSLR purchase and I couldn't be more happy with the choice.  I spent months researching cameras at local stores and online, and I don't feel I could have made a better decision in buying this product.  The product is user friendly and puts every control necessary at your fingertips.  The viewfinder is huge!  The images are absolutey breathtaking.  I will never go outside of the Olympus line if this model exemplifies the trend and commitment that they have to both product and customer.  Buy this camera, you won't rgret it.  I will update this review further after I've had the product a little while longer.

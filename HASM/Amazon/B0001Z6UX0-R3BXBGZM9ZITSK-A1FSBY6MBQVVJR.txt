Title: Great little heater
Content:
I have a small house and unfortunately a new, expensive powerful, loud forced air gas heat furnace.  I had it put in mainly for the air conditioning factor, but soon regretted the blasts of dry hot air last winter.  I missed my old hot water radiatior heaters.  I stumbled on this by accident.  I liked the looks, I know DeLonghi's reputation so I took a chance boaasting to everyone that I would never use my furnace again.  And to my surprise, I won't !!  lol  This is a great looking, quiet, safe little heater and it heats my 450 sq. ft. house well.  A nice toasty warm, natural heat, without all the dryness.  As the winter progresses and it becomes colder I may need a second heater but as of now it suits me just fine.  I have a fireplace that also provides some heat.  So my recommendation to those of you despairing over the cost of a furnace system:  Forget it.  I would have had I know about these !

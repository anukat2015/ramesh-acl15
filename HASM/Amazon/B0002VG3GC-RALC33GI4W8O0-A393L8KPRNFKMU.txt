Title: Took just over a month to arrive
Content:
Ordered Oct 13, arrived Nov 16. I haven't had time to really try it out. Rating is based on delivery time.
Added Feb 25: I finally went to use it, and there is a big weakness. You are supposed to keep the propane tank outside any building (according to legal codes). The unit has about an eight foot hose for the gas. The valve is on the top of the propane tank (outdoors) and the heating unit is, say, inside your garage. So you run outside to turn on the valve, then run inside to operate the ignitor. And of course the unit must be near the door, so if it goes up in flames it's blocking the exit. 
Ideally it would have a longer hose and valves at both ends.

Title: WOW this is great and fast
Content:
Best lap top I have every had and the price is about $500 cheaper than comparable lap tops.  Got mine at Best Buy for $899 and use it with wireless.  Processor is extremely fast, RAM is top of the line and hard drive is plenty big.  This lap top also look great.  The speakers are not very powerful so external speakers or headphones are recommended.  Battery life is very good with the power save option.  Mine came with McAfee virus protection and that works great too.  I play games, burn DVD/CDs, watch movies, upkeep my blog and load pics.  This lap top is the best on the market bar none and the price is right.  Buy it, I did :)

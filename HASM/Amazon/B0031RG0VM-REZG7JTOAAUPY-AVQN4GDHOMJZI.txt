Title: Great notebook for battery and portability
Content:
Using this laptop steadily for the last few days and the battery life has proven to be excellent. I'm consistently getting 6-7 hours of life without needing to resort to tricks like dimming the screen or avoiding certain types of applications (video, etc)
Other pros:
.Love the 500GB Hard Drive-- don't see this filling up anytime soon, even after adding lots of media files, documents and installing applications
.Processor is adequate for everything I've done so far - web surfing, videos, productivity apps- also the 4GB ram is a plus
.Incredibly light - I'm used to lugging around 15-in laptops for work, I can barely tell that this in my bag
.Screen resolution is also very good; easy to read documents and websites
.Didn't come preloaded with too much bloatware
The only con I have so far is the touch pad.  The multi-touch control is pretty useless and I find myself inadvertently zooming-in/out of open windows.   I'm mostly using an external USB mouse so this is not a major issue.   
I would highly recommend this system to anyone who wants the portability of a netbook but requires a good deal more disk space and memory.

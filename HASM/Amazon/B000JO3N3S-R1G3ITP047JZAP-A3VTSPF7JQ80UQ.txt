Title: TV output disabled--disappointed
Content:
Spent quite a bit of time looking at all the mp3/4 players out there and decided to go for a Nano classic. Has pretty much the same features as all the rest. What sold me what the TV output, which would come in handy for showing training videos on the fly.
Or so I thought. 
After buying two separate TV adapters, that the Radio Shack guy swore would work, I still had no video. 
I later find out that APPALL (thats apple) has intentionally disabled the TV output, except for their own cables, which not surprisingly are $50, compared to the $20 most 3rd party adapters go for. 
I like the Nano for its size and relative ease of use, but why needlessly anger Apple customers by intentionally frustrating them this way?
Disappointing. 
Until they come clean, buy a Zune or something from Samsung (since ipod memory is from them anyway). At least you know what you are getting.

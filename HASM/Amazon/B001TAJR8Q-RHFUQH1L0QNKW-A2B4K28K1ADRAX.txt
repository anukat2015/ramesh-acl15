Title: No Song Shuffle, Cheap Simple Player
Content:
If you want a simple cheap music player with none of the extras this is a good choice. The biggest negative there is no song shuffle and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars. I haven't tried the video part yet because I don't really care to take the time to convert video formats. I just got this because I was afraid to run with my ipod classic.

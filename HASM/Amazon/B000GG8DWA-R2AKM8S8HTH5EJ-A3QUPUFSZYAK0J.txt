Title: good heater at low price
Content:
nice little heater works well , if it holds up to daily use will be a great
deal, checked output with kil a watt meter 398 watts on low 796 watts on 
high, for the last 4 years have been using oil filled radiator heaters
have now switched to infared radiant heaters like this one, they feel
twice as warm for the same electric cost, must be within two to three feet
to get full effect from this heater, i am going on line to buy a second 
one, dont know how long the quartz tubes will last or if they are replaceable guess i will find out.

Title: The D300 is a superb camera.
Content:
I've been using the D300 for slightly over a month now and so far I haven't been disappointed in any way with how it's performed. At the beginning I wasn't getting pictures as sharp as I would have liked them but that was mostly my fault and since then I've refined my technique and I don't think I've ever seen sharper results. The camera is fast and paired with a faster CF card you can just keep shooting and never run out of buffer space shooting in raw.
If you're coming from an older camera like the D70s like I did, some of the new features may take some getting used to, the biggest change was the focus points. They did away with Closest Subject, the Dynamic Area focus is now quite complex with options for 9/21/51/51 point 3d area tracking options and the third option is "Big White Rectangle Mode" Ken Rockwell refers to it as such and since I can't remember it's actual name, I'll just refer to it that way. BWRM uses all 51 points automatically and the camera decides what should be the focus point, so far it's worked great for me, the things I want in focus are usually sharp, sometimes it gets it wrong, but since the camera can't read my mind, I don't mind really. Unfortunately the camera can sometimes be bogged down in 51 point mode if there's a really busy scene. The focus can sometimes lag before taking your initial shot but if you choose a mode with less than all 51 points then you'll never have this problem.
Battery life on a single EN-EL3e seems to be around 400-500 shots with heavy LCD usage which is much better than I thought it would be. Still, I ordered a second battery and the MB-D10 grip so I can continuously shoot without stopping to change batteries. I'll probably do an update to this review once the grip is here.
I don't think I can say anything bad about the camera, it's definitely a step up from the D70s, using the D300 exclusively then trying out the D70s makes the D70s feel like a child's toy. The D70s is still a great camera that I took some wonderful pictures with but I'd never go back to it after using the D300.

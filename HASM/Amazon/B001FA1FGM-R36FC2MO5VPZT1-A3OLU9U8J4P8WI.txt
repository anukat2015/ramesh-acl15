Title: Not for bedrooms.
Content:
We purchased this for our daughter's room which is on the west side and was the coldest room in the house.
Everytime it turned on and off during the night, it made a loud click and woke up my daughter.
If you put it on the lowest temperature thinking it would keep your room on a low heat, it still raised the temperature in the room to 80 degrees which made it too hot.
The eco-setting was worse, because it caused it to click on and off more often, waking her up more often.
The price wasn't bad, we purchased it at Lowe's and were able to return it fine. We're going to try a Delonghi next.
If you're not going to use this for a bedroom, it should be fine as long as you don't mind turning it on and off when it heats up too much.

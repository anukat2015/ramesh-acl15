Title: Amazing camera
Content:
My last camera was a 3MP that fit in my pocket.  I got this camera hoping to really take a step up from my old digital camera.  I mostly shoot famly outings and real estate.  I have gotten nothing but compliemnts from my work.  I am quick to point out that is is merely the camera that is making me look good.  Of course, owning this camera has made me want to get better at what I do.  Is it out of my league?  Maybe.  Will I outgrow it?  Not for many years to come and that whats made this a good investment for me.

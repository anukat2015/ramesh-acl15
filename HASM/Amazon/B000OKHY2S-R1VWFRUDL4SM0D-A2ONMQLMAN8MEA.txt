Title: Works But Needs Attention
Content:
This unit blows like a fan and does offer the benefit of cooler air, but only if you fill it with water on a regular basis.
We bought it for our 13 year old niece who came to stay for the summer and she is too lazy to fill it with water, so complains that it doesn't work.
If you are unlazy enough to add ice on hotter days, you're rewarded with significantly cooler air, as long as the ice lasts (maybe 1 hour).
In short, with constant attention, it's a decent, (much) cheaper alternative to a stand alone air conditioner.

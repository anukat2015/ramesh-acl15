Title: Sturdy, easy to use and clean, makes great espresso. Will buy this over Saeco Spidem Villa
Content:
Update on 10/30/09: I found the price fluctuating so much and I am compelled to update my review. Reviews are generally given for a certain price range. This is a great value under 200USD, about right at 250, and becomes expensive at over 300. In general, espresso machines are significantly more expensive than they should be.
This machine is easy to use and clean, and makes great espresso. It does not grind coffee beans so you need a stand-alone grinder or may buy ground coffee (for espresso machines). It has a small footprint and is aesthetically pleasing. At about half the price of the fully automatic Saeco Spidem Villa, this sure is a better buy.

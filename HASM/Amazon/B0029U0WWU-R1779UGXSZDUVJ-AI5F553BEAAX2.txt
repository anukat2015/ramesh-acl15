Title: Sony Alpha 230
Content:
I got the camera 2 weeks ago and so far I am very pleased. I am not a professional and I have always had a point-and-shoot cameras and this is my very first DSLR camera. For those who are looking for a DSLR camera on a budget this is a good choice! I can not afford a very expensive camera at this time, but this one is a good quality for the price you pay! Before I got it I read the revierws and I asked two professional photographers to look it up online and tell me what they think and both of them said "it is not bad at all" so I went ahead and got it. It is pretty easy to operate and I like the quality of the images and the overall appearance of the camera. I got an additional lense (70-300 mm) and I am very happy with this camera. 
Pros: decent quality for a relatively low price, good start for those who are making a transition from point-and-shoot camera to a SLR camera, you may buy additional lenses, tripods and otehr equipment and take the pictures you want, the battery life is pretty long, has many functions and settings for those who preffer manual mode and for those who do not want to mess with the manual mode. 
Cons: A230 one doesn't have a life view and it takes some getting used to, the one that has a life view is more expensive. No video. It comes without a camera case, you you will need to get one.

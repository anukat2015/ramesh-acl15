Title: Nice coffee maker but put a tray underneath!
Content:
Pros: It has a programmable timer. You can set the length of time it stays on (up to 4 hours). There's no need to have a glass carafe to worry about breaking. The coffee holder area comes out for easy cleaning. The cup holder comes out to allow taller cups.
Cons: The fill area is small and awkward. If you miss, the water will run under the coffee holder and get on the burner. If that happens the unit may not turn on and run. There is a hole in the bottom to let that water out but it goes right onto the counter underneath.  When you flip up the lid the moisture runs down the back and onto the counter causing a messy situation. Does not accept very tall cups. The pour spout is back underneath and it can be hard to see how much is in your cup.
My advice: buy the extended warranty. I had to take mine back 2 weeks before the extended warranty expired.

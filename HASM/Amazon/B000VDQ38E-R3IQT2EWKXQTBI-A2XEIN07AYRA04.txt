Title: Vacuum -After 1.5yrs smokes and dies
Content:
Have had this pet hair eraser for 1.5 years. Worked well on the carpet for my dog's pet hair for the first two months. Never really worked well on bare floors, just blew a good portion of the sand particles around and displaced them.
After two months, and exhaustive routine maintenance (constantly cleaning floor brush and turbo brush) the vacuum did not pick up as well, and the turbo brush ceased to work. I kept cleaning the turbo brush but it never worked again. Too bad because that is the tool that gets the pet hair off the stairs. The vacuum left lots of dog hair behind on the carpet, which could be seen on any article of clothing when playing with my kids on the floor.
Since I paid almost 200$ for it I kept using it. The more I used it, the louder it got. Still maintained it: cleaned it after EVERY use (what a hassle-took me longer to clean it then to actually vacuum a 2400 sq ft house), changed filters, cleaned filters. Also note (very important) every time I emptied the collected dirt a good portion of debris got everywhere.
So finally, it died. I was trying to vacuum the stairs. 6 stairs later I turned around and it was smoking. The smoke alarm went off and the kids were screaming and crying. Thanks Bissell, thanks for not picking up the pet hair, thanks for taking my 200bucks, and thanks for almost catching my house on fire. I will NEVER buy another Bissell again. And nor would I spend 500 on a dyson. Don't what I am going to buy next, but it seems like most vacuums these days are made poorly.

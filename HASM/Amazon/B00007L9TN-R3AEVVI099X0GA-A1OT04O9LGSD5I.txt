Title: Good for those with no central heat and air
Content:
Living in a house from the 60's that also has old jealousy windows (which we cover with plastic) the winters can be a pain. This heater may not "blast heat" a room up right away but it does take the edge off and make things more tolerable. As for the noise it's not an issue for me, but don't think it's really that noisy.

Title: If you don't expect it to heat the whole house, you'll love it.
Content:
One room at a time and this is the space heater for you.  I purchased two of these little fans after fighting with Vornado Heaters through two winters.  While I loved the Vornado I would never purchase one again (2 of these cost a third of the price!).  I don't have drafts anymore so I don't know how well it works if you have a drafty living area.
The ups:  Easy to use dials.  Puts out plenty of heat to take care of average sized rooms (I use one in a 15' X 10' and on in a 40' hallway).  Works well with it's own climate control settings (holds the temp where you set it), but since it's not digital you have to set it the old fashion way (letting it get as hot as you want it in the room and then slowly turning it down until it clicks off).  It also has plenty of length in the cord.  It's quiet and it's small.
The downs:  Must be unplugged to be turned off.  This is very annoying to me because I don't trust them enough to leave them on when I leave the house so it feels like I am always unplugging them.
It'll be interesting to see how well they work when the temps hit the 0 mark.

Title: Didn't like syncing.....
Content:
The product and sound were good, I didn't like the setup of itunes.  I didn't like that everytime you synced that you lost the music etc that was already on the ipod.  I use 2 computers so to add music from both I would have had to put all my music onto one computer.  I actually returned mine, now I am planning on buying a different player.

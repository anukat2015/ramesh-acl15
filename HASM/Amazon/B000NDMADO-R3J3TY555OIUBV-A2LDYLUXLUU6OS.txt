Title: Dyson Stowaway dc21    VERY dissappointed!
Content:
I have had my Dyson Stowaway for almost 2 years now and I have had to contact Dyson twice this year about the crappy hose breaking into!! I am very careful with this vacuum and only use it in my home,I have ALL hardwood floors. The last customer service agent I spoke with ask me what i did with my vacuum as they just replaced the hose in April of 2009 and that hose has already broken again and it's just November 2009. I ask the agent to make notes in my account about this continuing problem.I ask her where these hoses were made and she told me Malaysia. That may be part of the problem, who knows.They have always sent me a new hose at NO cost to me but who knows what will happen if this hose breaks again. The agent said that they will have to investigate further if it happens again! I have offered to send them the old broken hoses back and they tell me they don't want them. I also ask her if anyone else had this problem with the hose and she said that she had only had 3 complaints. Has any one else had this problem?? I'm just wondering.......thanks for any feedback.

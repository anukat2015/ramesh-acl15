Title: excellent option for high gas/propane bills
Content:
THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL!!!  I own 4 heaters and with a 2,250 sq ft house, the four heaters keep my house warm and toasty, even on the lowest fan setting.  I have had no problems at all with the heaters staying on the wall socket as stated by other buyers. (Just make sure you follow the installation instructions exactly.) As far as the extra socket, I have a lamp plugged into one of them and as long as the heater stays on low, I have no problems at all.  This is an excellent choice.  I do have one of four heaters where the fan rattles on high, but other than that, this was an excellent investment and does the trick.

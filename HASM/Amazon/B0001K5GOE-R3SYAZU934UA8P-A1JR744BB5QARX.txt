Title: good suction, but ....
Content:
The vacuum has good suction, but the powerhead is way to light to apply any pressure on the carpet, so don't expect to see your desired carpet tracks after you vacuum. Also its powerhead is small which is both advantageous and disvantageous at same time. It goes into samll spaces easily but takes too much time to cover large area. The canister body is rather unstable when you try to drag it around. Most importantly, it has got too many parts (such as telescoping wand, etc) that can break down the line (maybe after your 2 year warranty is over). Having a vacuum that has too much of sophiscated parts can impose a lot of problems. Less parts to break, better for consumers after warranty is out. For last five years, I was blessed with fantom lightning canister vacuum. the very first bagless cyclonic CANISTER vacuum was the best; durable, and strong suction is unparalleled. For the price, you should always get five stars from users.

Title: Excellent!! Just Simply Excellent
Content:
Okay I've had this ipod for 1 day and im totally loving it!! Believe me I was the last person whoever thought they would buy an ipod, but I'm extremely glad I did. 
Playback quality: 10 (Its like I can hear and experience songs like I never did previously) 
Apps: 10 (There is just so much to choose from, amazing) 
Internet: 10 (Excellent speed, the youtube app is great, and I am loving that the ipod plays flash videos.) 
Video: 10 (Crisp quality) 
Battery life: 11 (It does not take like for the iptouch to charge especially if you have purchased a wall changer. The most it will take to charge fully is about a 30 mins and that is a must especially when you are a heavy listener like me) 
Other features: 10 (I especially love the note pad and the microphone feature because I am a student and to carry tons of paper around isn't the most convenient for me. So I love the fact that I can either record what the lecturer is saying or type little notes to myself on what is going in class. Excellent!!) Plus I love reading the bible so it is really convenient when you get word from the Lord to just say it in the mic and listen back later so that you can contemplate on what he has revealed to you, but it is also lovely to just type scriptures on the note pad function and study anytime your on the go. Oh how great it is not having to carry around all those tons of paper of bible study notes and things that the Lord has revealed to me now I can just have it all in the palm of my hand. My suggestion is to get this itouch you won't regret it!!!

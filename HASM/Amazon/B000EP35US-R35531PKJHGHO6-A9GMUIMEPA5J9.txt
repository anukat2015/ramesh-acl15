Title: All My Cd's In This Little Thing???
Content:
I recently purchased this ipod and can't say enough about it. I have over 1700 songs on this which i used to have to play one at a time in my CD player. Now i can carry all of those to the Gym with me and listen to them as i work out with this little guy clipped to my side (it looks a little bigger than a stick of gum). The controls are intuitive and easy to use. Not much more you can ask for in an MP3 player...Oh yeah....it  hooks right in to my home theater system so i guess i can throw all those Cd's away...It's changed the way i listen to music. Finally...an all around practical solution for music lovers...and it never EVER skips!!

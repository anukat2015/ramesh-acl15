Title: This camera is great
Content:
I have had this camera for 5 months and love it. The main alternative was the d80 which had some advantages (bracketed exposures, front command wheel for f-stop adjustment and more dedicated buttons) The D40 feels better to small hands and is significantly lighter. The camera is very intuitive. Battery life is impressive even using the flash. The kit lenses give good images. They are light and therefore not bulletproof but you don't hesitate taking them on a hike either. This camera is great.

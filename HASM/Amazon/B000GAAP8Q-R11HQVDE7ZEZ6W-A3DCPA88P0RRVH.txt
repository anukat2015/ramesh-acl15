Title: don't buy this product as service is a nightmare
Content:
If I can prevent one person from going through Apple hell I will be happy.
My 3 month old Ipod locks up after every use, requiring rehooking it up to the computer and also recharging since it locks in the on position and drains battery.  I called customer service (always a 15 minute wait) and was told that my Ipod was out of warranty--yet it's only 3 months old!  She finally agreed I was in warranty period, told me she would send packaging for Ipod return.  14 days later I still have not received packaging, I call back and am told again I'm out of warranty.
Now I'm asked to fax proof of purchase and wait up to 5 days to hear from them.  But they won't mail me package for return until after that call.  I can see I won't have the I pod for a couple of weeks more.
I asked if I could return it to the Apple store.  Not without an appointment with a "Mac Genius".  Called the store.  Recording says I can't get an appointment over the phone.
This is not worth any product.

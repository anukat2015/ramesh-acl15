Title: Dysfunctional Vacuum!
Content:
Just like K. Dixon, I had high hopes when purchasing this vacuum.  The Pet Turbobrush is a joke.  It's not motorized but runs on the suction.  I found it to be totally useless on low pile stair runner, the main reason I bought the vacuum.  My next mistake was going from a canister type to an upright.  This vacuum is heavy, cumbersome, and requires way too much maintenance to perform well.  All too frequent cleaning of the upper and lower tanks puts lots of dust and dirt in the air, and if you don't do it, it leaves dust balls on the carpet.
Aggravation over poor performance pushed me to write this review!

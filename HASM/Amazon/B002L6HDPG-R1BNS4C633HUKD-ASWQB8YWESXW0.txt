Title: Nice iPod
Content:
What can I say, it's an iPod and I love it.
Used to have a nano 1st generation, so I bought this as a replacement, packed with functionality, except for the camera, I would've expected to take pictures but it only takes video WTF? Somehow Apple screwed on that one feature, so I hope they fix that in a future firmware release.

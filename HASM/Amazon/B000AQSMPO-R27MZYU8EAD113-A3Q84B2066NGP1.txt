Title: simple
Content:
Bought one from Bed Bath & Beyond, for only $120 with 20% coupon off list of $149.  Machine is incredibly easy to use and coffee quality is better than I expected.  My wife uses it for tea and has been quite pleased.  Only downside is quantity if you are accustomed to drinking more then one mug of at time.

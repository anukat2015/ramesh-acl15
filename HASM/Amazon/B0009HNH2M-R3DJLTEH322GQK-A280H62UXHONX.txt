Title: JUNK
Content:
Works great for about 2 weeks.  It is now sitting in the closet with all of the other JUNK vacuums I have bought over the years.  The bags do not fit properly and the canister fills with dirt.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I bought a vacuum for $40 and it works 100 times better and I have had it for 5 months.

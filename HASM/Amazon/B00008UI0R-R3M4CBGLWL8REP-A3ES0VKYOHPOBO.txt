Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
After moving into my new home with multiple floor surfaces, I decided that this vacuum would serve me best.  It had 3 suction speeds, on/off switch for the beater bar and is easy to switch as I change where I'm vacuuming.  And this vacuum really cleans!  It is easy to move around, has an adjustable wand height.  I especially like being able to empty the cup after each use and wash out all the dust that my old Oreck was not picking up.  Good on animal hair.  Would highly recommend it

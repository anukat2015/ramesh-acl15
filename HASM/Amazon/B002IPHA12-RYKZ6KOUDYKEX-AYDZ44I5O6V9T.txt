Title: Walkman
Content:
Walkman is better to use than the new Ipod Nano. My daughter has no problem using the Walkman. She loves it.  The only downfall is the battery life. It seems like we need to charge it more than we should. Overall I highly recommend the product. Alot cheaper and easy to use compared to the Nano.

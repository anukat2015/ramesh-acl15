Title: I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if i could
Content:
This is one sweet Notebook. I have not had an apple notebook since the clamshell ibook. The first one i received had some dead pixels on the screen, Amazon took it back with no problem and sent a replacement out next day delivery once they received the one i shipped back. This second one i have is perfect, Props to amazon customer service for an amazing job. The one i purchased is an intel core 2 duo, 2.5 ghz, 2 gb ram, 250 gb hard drive, 15.4' Matte screen, I would have preferred the glossy screen but it was not available from amazon and the price i bought it for was almost a grand cheaper than newegg. Build quality and design is excellent. I was so satisfied with this MBP and the service i got from amazon i bought a white macbook 2.4ghz, 2gb ram, 160gb hard drive to use for business. The best bonus of these notebooks is they simply work, i do not spend anymore time on fixing problems with my operating system or worrying about viruses and purchasing software to keep my system running right. I am back to using Apple for good, the operating system was so easy to pickup on coming from vista.

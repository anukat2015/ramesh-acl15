Title: Incredible for the price
Content:
I had a Compaq v2000 and a Dell Vostro for two years each before they crashed.  It didn't make sense to get ANOTHER expensive machine ($700+) because, for me, laptops just don't last.  
For a while, I was deciding between the Lenovo S12 and the Samsung NC20.  Both were around $450 - $500.  I actually placed an order for the new s12 with NVidia Ion and thought I was getting a great deal for the price. 
Then, I stumbled across this little machine.  Instead of getting a very slow atom processor, I was getting a DUAL CORE machine at a sub $400 price point with no tax and free shipping!  The choice was clear.
I've had this machine for a few weeks now and I'm loving it.  They keyboard took a little while to get used to (I prefer raised keys), but after some practice, I'm flying.  It didn't come with bluetooth, but I echo what the previous reviewer said about installing an internal module.  Of course, you need to be VERY careful doing this, but I'm so glad I did.  The hardest part for me was taking out the screws.  They are REALLY stuck in there.
Also, the HDMI out is a great feature.  I'm able to easily output to my HDTV and watch streaming videos from Hulu.
If you're looking for an inexpensive laptop that you can use for web browsing, youtube, hulu, word docs, etc. then you'll be very happy with the Acer Aspire 1410.

Content:
This camera takes great photographs, and after two years of taking it everywhere with me, I don't have a single complaint.  Though it should be noted that getting the best results from this camera may occasionally required an incredibly steady hand(no image stabilizer) and a pretty in depth technical understanding (lots of manual features).

Title: Product review
Content:
I purchased this item with the intention of recording my professors at school and some additional studies I am involved in.  It's a fair purchase for the price.  The manual is a download, this is okay, but when you can't figure something out and you can't find it in the manual, it becomes frustrating.  I have a friend who has the same unit, he has helped me navigate.  Function keys are tiny.  Screen is tiny with tiny print.  Music download playback sound is fantastic.  Audio has a lot of background noise.  Ear phones are not the best, but they are functional.

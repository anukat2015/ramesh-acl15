Title: Finally!
Content:
Reading the other reviews of this product I realized I had to write one of my own to help potential purchases realize they will really be missing out if they bypass this heater. This is the fourth space heater I've purchased in the last two months and finally one I can keep.
My living room has three sets of glass french doors, high ceilings, and lots of windows. It is very hard to heat it, but there is no central heating system, so I have to rely on space heaters. I tried the expensive Vornado (over $100), which didn't make a dent in the cold, the noisy Honeywell oscillator (which not only gave me a headache it was so loud, but also didn't provide quite enough heat, though it heated better than the Vornado), and the WindChaser radiant heater (which left the room freezing cold but made me sweat at the same time, extremely unpleasant). Finally I found this item.
It heats the room to the point where it actually shuts off sometimes, having reached the desired 65 degrees at night or 70 degrees in the day. The fan is as quiet as the Vornado when on high and is even quieter when on low. The quietest heater I've ever found. And as for the cord, while my oil filled heater does have a thicker cord and I do notice that this cord gets warm where that one doesn't, after 96 hours of continuous usage, it is just barely warm. Hardly anything I would worry about starting a fire, though a thicker cord would be a good investment for the manufacturer to make.
Given the natural limitations of space heaters, I think you simply can't do better than this one. If this heater doesn't work for you, then an electric space heater isn't going to do it for you and you should be looking at other heating options entirely.

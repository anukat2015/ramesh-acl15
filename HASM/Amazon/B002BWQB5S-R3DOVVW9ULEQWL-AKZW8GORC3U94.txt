Title: compaqs are bad
Content:
Had a CQ60 computer for a little over a year and the battery gets to 40% and the computer dies.  Warranty expired 2 weeks ago and HP can't help me.  I went online to buy a new battery and surprise, everyone says the battery sucks.  My previous Compaq, the AC adapter died after 2 weeks and HP sent a replacement.  My brother's Compaq, the battery died after a year and he bought a new one after his wireless card died too.  This is the last Compaq I buy ever.

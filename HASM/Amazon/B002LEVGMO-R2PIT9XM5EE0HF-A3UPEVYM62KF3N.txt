Title: Everything I heard in reviews but
Content:
Everything I heard in the reviews so far is what I have experienced.  You want to ensure you have the configuration for the 1410-xxxx, the xxxx will determine how the specs are implemented i.e., 2 gb ram is 2/0 versus 1/1 meaning a 2 gb chip in one slot versus 1 gb chip in 2 slots.  Also the headphone jack does not seem to work but have not taken te time to see if the set up is correct or if it is a defect.

Title: Great MP3 Player, I highly Recommend
Content:
I owned an IPOD 60 GB before this MP3 player.  I really like the ZEN.  My favorite feature is that it doesn't require Itunes to upload music, you can just use Windows Explorer and it's that simple.  You don't even need any drivers installed, at least while using it with Windows XP.  The battery life is pretty long (haven't really measure it), the unit is small and light, and the sound is very good.  Another feature that I love that this unit has over the IPOD is the ability to add SDHC cards to expand the memory.  This is a great feature that I don't understand why Apple doesn't do.  I also prefer the type of headphones supplied with the Zen over other units since they fit better and silence out the surroundings.
Here's a few things that I wish they had improved on:
- The buttons need a back light, it's difficult to see what you are pressing esecially when there are nine little buttons right next to each other in the dark.  
- I wish the album cover could be displayed in some of the menus to make it easier for which album to choose.
- The power button should be move from the back of the unit, I think it's an awkward location.  
These are minor faults for me and the pro's out weigh the cons for my decision to purchase this unit.

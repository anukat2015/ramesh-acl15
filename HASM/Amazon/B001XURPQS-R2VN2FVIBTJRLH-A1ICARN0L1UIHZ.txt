Title: Review for the non-newbies
Content:
I'll tell you - when my wife first gave me the okay to upgrade from my Rebel Xti, I didn't know whether to hug her or take her to the hospital. Then came the greatest question of all time - which one?
Luckily, all options were available to me since the 7D had already shipped. My budget was $3K so, cost (to some extent) wasn't a issue. So began my journey.
I looked at the following camera bodies:
1. Canon 5D Mark II - Too pricey. Bulky and can't use my 10-22 EF-S UWA.
2. Canon 5D - Can't use my 10-22 EF-S UWA.
3. Canon 7D - Great camera w/ Video, APS-C sensor, two (count em TWO) Digic4 processor, 100% coverage pentaprism viewfinder, totally upgraded AF system, it Brand Spankin NEW!
4. Canon 50D - This camera was obsolete as soon as it was introduced. No thanks.
5. Canon T1i - What's with the stupid name? (Thanks Agassi, jerk.) Same sensor as 50D, Video, 920K screen, light weight, more $$ leftover for lenses.
6. Nikon D700 - Too pricey, control are too difficult to learn (I'm sorry, but to me IT IS).
7. Nikon D300s - Too pricey for using APS-C sensor. Might as well get the 7D.
8. Nikon D5000 - Nice IQ, but no motor on body, 230K screen, swivel screen sucks.
* Also, Nikon is no doubt a great camera company, but I still prefer the different lenses available through Canon.
So, after two months of going back-and-forth between the 7D and T1i - I decided to pick the T1i and spend the extra $1k on the sweet new 100mm f2.8L IS macro. The more and more I think about it, more and more it becomes clear that camera's ability is pretty limited to the operator's talent & imagination. And since camera bodies don't hold their value so well, I figure I can upgrade to the 7D or 5D Mk2 in a couple of years at a fraction of the price.
This is what I had for the last 3 years:
Canon Rebel Xti, 18-55 kit lens, 10-22mm EF-S UWA, 50mm f1.8
This is what I have now:
Canon Rebel X1i, 18-55 IS kit lens (which is awesome), 10-22mm EF-S UWA, 50mm f1.8, 100mm f2.8L IS macro, 70-200mm f4L IS
I can say with confidence that I'm happy with my decision. Although the 7D might of given me bragging rights, I'd much rather have an L lens.
--- edit ---
Okay, after a month of playing with this thing I can honestly say that the IQ is waaaaaaay too soft. I don't know if Canon is doing that to reduce the ISO noise, but even @ ISO 200 I can't get a clean shot (I'm using 50mm f1.8, 100mm f2.8L IS, 70-200mm f2.8L IS so I KNOW it's not the glass). This camera is crap, and the video feature is gimmicky at best.
If you're considering this garbage, do yourself a favor and save a few hundred bucks and get the Rebel Xti(you'll get a much sharper picture) or spend a bit more and get the 50D.

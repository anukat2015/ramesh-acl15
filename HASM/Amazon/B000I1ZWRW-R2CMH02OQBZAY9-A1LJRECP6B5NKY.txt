Title: Digital Rebel XTi
Content:
This is a very nice beginning digital SLR camera for the serious amateur and budding professional.  Lots of features and quite capable of taking very nice pictures.  The lens in the kit is okay though it is a step below the camera.  I did get several USM lenses and they work just fine with the XTI.
I did order the battery grip along with the camera and I would suggest it to everyone as the camera, though very capable, is on the smallish side without it.

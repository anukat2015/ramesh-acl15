Title: Proctor-Silex 48574 Automatic Drip Coffeemaker
Content:
It makes coffee. I am not a coffee expert but I have tasted better brewed coffee. Since buying this coffeemaker I have discovered I like the cone shaped filters better than the flat bottomed bowl shaped filter that this coffeemaker uses. It is an OK coffeemaker. It still is working after a year and for the price that is good.

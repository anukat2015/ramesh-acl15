Title: Finally!  Warm, comfy feet!
Content:
I work for an HVAC contractor so you'd think I would be warm in my office being that my office is located in the same room as the furnace! But I always had a problem keeping my feet warm which would always leave me feeling cold.  I keep this little space heater under my desk and it really keeps me warm all day.  It has two levels of heat so if I'm really cold, I can turn it up to the higher level.  The thermostat works well, too.  I really recommend this for a small space or room.

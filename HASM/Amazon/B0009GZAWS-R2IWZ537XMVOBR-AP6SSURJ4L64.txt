Title: Great Camera
Content:
Great pictures, and easy to use, including the menu. Can just point and shoot, plus much additional customization. I added a Patriot 4 Gbyte high speed SD memory chip and can take 2200+ jpeg quality pictures, although the battery will require charging before running out of memory.

Title: Great dSLR!
Content:
This camera is still the best bang for your buck dSLR on the market unless you go with the upgraded 'Super' K100D which they released recently. Bought the [Body Only] model because I have a whole bunch of lenses from my Pentax SF1 SLR that I used before.  All of the lenses and filters that I have for the old camera fit directly on this one with no adapter required!  I've always been partial to Pentax and this camera works great and meets all of my expectations as usual.  I can fit over 550 pics on a 2GB SD card in the highest .jpg resolution. If you prefer RAW format, this camera does it too, but with much more space required per picture.  You can take professional pictures quickly and easily with this camera.  The only complaint that I have about this camera is the relatively slow Buffer/Memory Writer that disallows you from taking really rapid continuous shots.  Otherwise, pair this camera with some NiMH batteries from Sony w/ charger (19.99 on amazon) and I've taken over 3000 pictures with flash before the Low Battery indicator started flashing!  Would recommend this camera to everyone unless you plan on taking rapid fire pictures, in which case I'd say to go with the Nikon D40 or the Canon Digital Rebel XT (both of which cost more).

Title: a good and reliable laptop
Content:
I own this laptop for over a year now. It works just fine. As any Vaio it comes with lots of Sony software that is very useful. Despite the fact that this laptop came with Vista which nowadays it is an old (and sometime soon extinct) OS it is a reliable laptop, has worked fine so far, no common blue screens despite it happens anyway, but I totally recommend it because a good reliable performance.

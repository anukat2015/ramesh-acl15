Title: Bargain Price, Quality Purchase
Content:
This is a fantastic product! I have had this product for about 9 months and I use it to make my morning coffee every day. It is easy and fast to use. It is ideal for living in a college dorm because it allows me to make hot water for other food items as well.
My only possible complaint is that although the wire mesh filter is handy because it never needs to be replaced, I found that it let some coffee grounds through. #1 size coffee filters work well in addition to the permanent filter. They can be bought at most grocery stores. 
Despite my one complaint, this product has been extremely reliable and considering the price, it simply cannot be beat.
Update: Less than a year after buying this product, I bought a keurig coffee maker. Although it cost much more than this product, it was well worth the money. I no longer use this coffee maker. I still think it's a good product for the money, but not worth keeping forever.

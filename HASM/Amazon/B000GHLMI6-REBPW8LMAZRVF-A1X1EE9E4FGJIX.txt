Title: Wonderful!!!
Content:
This is by far the best coffee maker I have ever owned!!  It is great not to have a dripping carafe and no more rust on a hot plate.  This coffee maker is easy to use and very neat.  The whole coffee tank comes out, making it easy to fill with water by your sink. There is also a spout at the corner which makes it very simple to pour that water into the water reservoir.  It's wonderful to be able to simply press your mug up to coffee dispense bar, and have your coffee without any spills or dripping!!!!  Love It!!!

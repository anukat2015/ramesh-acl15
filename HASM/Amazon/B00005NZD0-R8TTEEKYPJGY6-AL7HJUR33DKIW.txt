Title: Great machine, I like it
Content:
I purchased this machine just over a year ago (January 2003) and have never had any problems with it.  It is a huge space saver on the kitchen counter, compared to having separate espresso and coffee machines.  The frother does require cleaning after use, this is to be expected from any frother.  My only wish is that it had been shipped with a frother cup and a tamper, as these things are useful accessories for the machine which I ended up purchasing separately.

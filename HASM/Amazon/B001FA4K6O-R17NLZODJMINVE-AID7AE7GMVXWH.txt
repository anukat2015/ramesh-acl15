Title: Keeps a room warm
Content:
We tend to keep our central heating set pretty low (65 during the day, 61 overnight), but we have a newborn so we wanted to keep one of the rooms really warm. This unit does a good job of keeping a 14x12 ft. room warm during the day and overnight. As the other reviews say, it doesn't heat up a cold room very quickly, but it does a good job of maintaining a temperature once it get to its target temp.
pro: it seems to do a good job maintaing a temperature once you figure out the right dial positions. It doesn't keep swinging between too cold and too hot.
cons:
1. No temperature degrees markings -  I'd really prefer to be able to turn the dial to 70 degrees and know that it'll shut off at 70. The way it is now, I had to turn the dial all the way up, wait for the room to get too hot, turn it down a little, then a little more, etc. until it finally kept the room at a comfortable temperature.
2. Timer - it'd be nice if it had a built in timer so it would turn on/off at preset times. Right now we just have to switch it off and then *hope* we remember to switch it on a few hours before we want the room to be warm.

Content:
I had an older 3G nano whose screen went black in a relatively short amount of time, so I was a bit hesitant on trusting another ipod. So far, this one has worked out great for me and has all the features I use such as, video, podcasts, FM radio and even a video camera. I use it on all my runs, almost everyday. I love the green version I purchased.

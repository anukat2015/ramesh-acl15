Title: Great Canister aspirator
Content:
I have this vacuum cleaner now approx. 1 month and I can only say good things. Works great and was very easy to install. Took me 5 min to get it out from the box and push the bottom and it worked! 
The only reason I do not give five stars is because the accessories are really small and they are looking like toys to me, nevertheless they work fine! I am also concerned about the wheels which do not look very solid to me. Maybe I am wrong and the futur will tell me more about the quality of this vacuum cleaner. For the moment he works perfect. 
New to me was also the Bagless system: It is a bit weard and you better put on some gloves. :o) BUT...You really see everything what's going in and this is a lot(I was amazed the first time, we have two dogs and it fills up very quickly). I clean mostly each time after using the vacuum cleaner and can be sure that the suction is and stays perfect. 
 The aspirator is very light and easy to handle! I had a Kenmoore before which was much more heavier. This little sucker beats him easily. I am from Europe and prefer definetely these Canister aspirators than the heavy American stand up's.Good job Hoover!
Great item, go for it with NO hesitation!

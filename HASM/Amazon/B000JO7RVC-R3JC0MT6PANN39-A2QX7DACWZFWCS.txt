Title: iPod 160 review
Content:
I expected it better. I have already two of 60 Gb and one of 80 Gb. A first negative comment, it does not work with iPOD2iPOD and it is not possible to transfer the content of the 80 Gb to the new one. A second one I have the feeling that the battery lasts less than the 80 Gb.
They could have include FM radio and Recording. On the other side, the positive thing, is the big disk space, nothing else.

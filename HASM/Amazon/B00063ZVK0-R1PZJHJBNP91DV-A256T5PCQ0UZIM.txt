Title: It's OK but a previous model is better
Content:
I have an 8-year old BVH model Vornado that is still going strong, and needed another for another room, so I bought this DVH model. I'll keep it, but it is a let down. Here's why. The BVH model had a thermostat control that continuously varies heat and fan speed to maintain temperature. The DVH, however, cycles abruptly between high and low to maintain temperature. Plus, when it cycles to low, there is an annoying 60-cycle buzz, such as you might hear from a transformer. I have my doubts about the usefulness of the digital display -- with the heat and vibration, I expect the display will be the first part to fail in a year or so. 
It's OK and I'll keep it, but I would rather have another BVH, and think it is no longer made. Both models do, indeed, distribute heat in a room more evenly than those radiator-style electric heaters or small heaters that have a small, loud, fan.

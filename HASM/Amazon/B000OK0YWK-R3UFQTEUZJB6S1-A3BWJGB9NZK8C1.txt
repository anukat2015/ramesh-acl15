Title: Zune is awesome
Content:
The Zune is awesome and I am so happy I did not fall for the Ipod trend or hype. This small device is a joy to listen to. My words cannot describe how much I love this thing. It even comes with preloaded music and videos that if you don't like you can always delete. The Zune pass subscription is awesome if you can afford it. I have been missing the benefits of being a Zune pass member.  You can listen to full songs and albums to choose to put on your Zune at will. Love it, but be warned because once you cancel or stop paying your monthly subscription fee you lose all your songs and none of the files can be played on your Zune, so I recommend buying Zune gift cards to buy songs from the marketplace once in a while especially if you just rip and convert all your music like I do and it also maybe handy once Microsoft starts adding podcasts and movies to the Zune marketplace. Also I think Zune pass members can keep content from the Zune marketplace if you do not download much music and most of your content is comedy albums.

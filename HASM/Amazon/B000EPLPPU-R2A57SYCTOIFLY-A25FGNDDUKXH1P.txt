Title: Perfect for exercising!
Content:
I own a 30gb iPod with video, which holds all my music, but when I started working out at the gym, I really wanted something smaller that I could have more of an upbeat playlist for.  I went for the iPod shuffle instead of the Nano, because of the very small size of the shuffle and because of the shuffling of songs.  I decided the Nano held too much for what I wanted to use it for, especially when I already have the iPod with video.  I like the fact that the Shuffle has no screen, and it is great to just be able to clip it on to your shirt or pocket, while everyone else has their clunky iPod Nano or iPod with video strapped to their arm.
I love this thing!

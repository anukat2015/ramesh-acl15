Title: Nice coffeemaker, but....
Content:
I received this coffeemaker as a gift.  I really like the ease of the function controls and I like having a thermal carafe.  The problem - the coffee isn't hot enough.  I end up putting my cup in the microwave for a bit just to get the temp up.  According to the instruction book, Kitchenaid recommends that you heat the thermal carafe with hot water before making coffee in order to get a hotter brew.  Well, that's great if you're making it right then, however, I like to set up the coffeemaker to come on in the mornings so I don't have to get up and make it which means the carafe will be cold when the coffee is brewing.  This, of course, means I don't get coffee as hot as I'd like.  Coffee temp aside, this is a really good machine, easy to use controls and coffee tastes really good.

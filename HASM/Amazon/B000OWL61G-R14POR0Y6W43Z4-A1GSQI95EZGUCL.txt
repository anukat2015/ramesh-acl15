Title: Expensive piece of junk
Content:
We purchased this coffeemaker because it had a large capacity pot (we drink a LOT of coffee) and was in a red color that would match our kitchen. I was willing to pay $99 for a coffeemaker with good features, but this item isn't worth 5 cents. It is all style and no substance. A coffeemaker should do two things - brew coffee and get it in the carafe. This does neither. After two days of more coffee on the countertop than in the pot, it was boxed up and returned to the store. While I have no great love for Mr. Coffee brand, we did find a Mr. Coffee model that had the exact same features of this Kitchenaid for 1/3 the cost and we're now happily using that with no problems. Stay away from the Kitchenaid. I've given this item one star ONLY because Amazon wouldn't let me give it zero.

Title: I love this laptop!
Content:
I've been using my new Sony Vaio 510 for about three weeks now and I'm very pleased with it.  I love how light and fast it is and I especially like the feel of the keyboard.  Perhaps the sound could be a bit better and it would be great if the battery power lasted longer (mine lasts about 2 hours and 45 minutes), but this laptop is such a major improvement over my cruddy Toshiba that those things don't bother me at all.  I'm really happy that I went with this Vaio.

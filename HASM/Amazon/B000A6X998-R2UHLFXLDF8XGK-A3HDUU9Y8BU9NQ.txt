Title: Scary heater
Content:
I am originally from Maine and I now reside in San Antonio, Texas, where we are experiencing some very unusual cold weather and I felt the need to break down and buy a heater.  I just bought this heater at Target based on Consumer Reports recommendation.  Scary.  I plugged it in, billows of smoke appeared, and a small flame shot out from one of the heating elements.  I immediately turned it off and inspected the heater.  One of the elements was broken in three different places.  This is a brand-new heater, folks.  I read another review listed here of someone who had the same problem.  It sounds like a serious safety recall notification is in order from Holmes.  Be careful.

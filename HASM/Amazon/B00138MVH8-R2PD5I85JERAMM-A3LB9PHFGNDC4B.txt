Title: great camera, but........
Content:
great camera. The one thing I wasn't expecting was that it takes so great pictures that it will make an inexpensive lens look cheap. These Kit lenses were fine for my smaller processor cameras and gave some very good pictures but this one simply shows any and all imperfections in my older, inexpensive lenses........tried one of the newer, more expensive lens, made for this model, and took great pictures.... guess I learned my lesson that if I'm going to use a great camera, don't try to shoot cheap... the pictures will tell the story... new lenses coming to my collection, soon.

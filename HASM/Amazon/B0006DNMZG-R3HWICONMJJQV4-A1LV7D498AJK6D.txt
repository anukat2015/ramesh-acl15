Title: Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround Heater
Content:
I bought this little heater because my dorm room was way too cold or way too warm. During the cold weather the heater did wonders and my dorm room is a decent sized room not a really small one. Also since the weather is becoming really nice the fan is doing a really great job as well! I definitely recommend this heater. It is a bit loud though, but once you get used to it, it's really not a big deal at all. I'd rather have some background noise than be freezing. All in all the heater provides a good source of heat.

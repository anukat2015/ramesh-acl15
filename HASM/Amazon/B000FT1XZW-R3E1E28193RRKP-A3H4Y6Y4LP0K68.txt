Title: best oil-filled heater
Content:
This is a steady-performing, stably thermostat-controlled (I mostly use setting #3) and economical heater. I prefer this model to DeLonghi "Dragon" because it's more efficient if you use it on the first floor and have stairs to the 2nd. The  "Dragon" thing is pumping hot air very actively upstairs while this model have very reasonable lateral heat distribution. It's not for warming you up while you sit nearby, but for warming the entire room when you have the unit steadily on.  
Other obvious advantages -- no noise, only gentle clicking sounds when thermostate turns heating elements on/off and no initial burning smells reported by others (maybe just my luck). Pretty elegant looking thing. Perfect for a large closed  bedroom, though I use it also in a living room permanently open to the stairs.

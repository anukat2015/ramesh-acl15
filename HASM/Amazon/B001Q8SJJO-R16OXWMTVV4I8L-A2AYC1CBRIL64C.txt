Title: The Answer to Shop Cooling
Content:
My shop is located in the SE part of the country so heat and humidity are a real problem, especially when working outdoors.  
While looking for a solution, I started to wonder if the "swamp coolers" I saw on the side lines at football games might be the ticket.  I was skeptical, due to the fact that the inherent high humidity would diminish the evaporative cooling that enables these devices to work.  Still I saw these things everywhere, so I was interested.  After a little research  I found that the current models overcome a lot of the evaporative cooling/humidity issue via modern design.
My hopes were dashed when I started pricing these coolers, BIG BUCKS!  I could install a separate AC system for the same price.    Then by "divine intervention", I saw a portable version, when I walked into my local NAPA store.  The salesman told me the way they market these coolers, is to drop them off at local garages during the day and then pick them up after it gets hot.  Once people see the difference they make, they're sold.  I was sold too when I got a great deal on the end of season model.
I'm impressed with the Port-a-Cool.  Temps have only been in the 80's with low humidity, but the cooling is noticeable.  The fan is big enough to make a "breeze" even sitting on the driveway.  It's easy to move around can be used during any outdoor activity. So far this has been a great and cost effective cooling solution.  
Tip:  Add ice to the reservoir for even greater cooling effect.

Title: Not worth even one star
Content:
It's three o'clock in the morning and I haven't been to sleep yet because of the noise of my brand new unit. It sounds like I'm on a small jet just about to take off. And with all the noise, one would think the temperature would drop--but no, it's been 80 degrees since I turned it on high 10 HOURS AGO!!
I am angry and disappointed. This is getting returned today.

Title: Awesome Value!
Content:
There were several reasons I settled on the Olympus E-500, some of which were due to the customer reviews from this site.  I researched and read reviews, visited web sites from Canon, Fuji, Sony and Nikon.  I also read reviews about the various lower-end DSLRs from those respective sites.  For the price and features and quality/bang-for-the-buck - there could be no other choice but the E-500.  I received mine on Jan. 18 of '07.  The very first picture I took (camera on full auto) was my goofy face.  I was stunned to see skin pores and little hairs I never knew existed!  For better or worse, the detail I have seen with the two lenses are amazing.  My other buddies (who also have more money than I) have a Canon, Sony and Pentax. I feel that the crispness and color are much better than the aforementioned DSLRs.  This camera kit rocks!  I received so much more for my $$s spent.  Excellent!

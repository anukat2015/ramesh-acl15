Title: It is always on?!
Content:
I recently purchased this coffee maker based on the rave reviews.  I do think it makes coffee astoundingly quickly, however, I did not realize that was because the coffee maker is ALWAYS on (unless you turn it off) in order to keep water hot in the tank all the time.  I only make one pot of coffee per day, in the a.m., so keeping water warm ALL the time doesn't seem very efficient, kind to my electric bill, or kind to the environment.  If you turn it off, there is a series of steps to go through to turn it back on in order for the water to heat and the unit to work correctly, it is not as simple as flipping a switch.  If you make several pots of coffee a day, I think this is better suited for you.

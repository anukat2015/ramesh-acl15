Title: No Problems
Content:
I got this player for my 5 year old and so far we have had no problems with it. She uses it often and its great for travel. She is able to operate it and the fact that it has a speaker is great so that she doesn't have to use head phones. I use a mac so loading music was a simple drag and drop onto the player.

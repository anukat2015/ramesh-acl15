Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
Excellent review after several weeks using the Capresso. I was actually a little concerned about the spilling issue after reading some of the previous reviews, but honestly you really need to be careless to let it happen - just align the carafe well and it works flawlessly (not a single spill and making coffe twice a day now for almost a month).
Key pros: carafe mantains coffee temperature really well; coffee is hot and nice upon brewing; strength is also very good, and responds very well to variations in ground coffee quantity; maker and carafe look nice in the kitchen; timer works really well to let the coffe ready in the morning.
Minor con: every time you unplug it you have to adjust the clock again - should have a battery backup.
All in all extremely satisfied with the purchase, strongly recommend it.

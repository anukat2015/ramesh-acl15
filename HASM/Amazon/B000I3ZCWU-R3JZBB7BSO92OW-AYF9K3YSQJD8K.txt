Title: Sweet Mercy its a great shot
Content:
So far so good, after many reviews and trying to make a good decision on my part to purchase and now a few days of pictures I could not be more pleased.  Camera takes great shots, great detail, speed, and most of all my kid can aim and shoot and get great results as well as leaving me the freedom of very good artistic control of everything. The difference between this camera and a $300 small digital camera is well, no comparison.  Spend the extra $ and get a real camera like this. :)

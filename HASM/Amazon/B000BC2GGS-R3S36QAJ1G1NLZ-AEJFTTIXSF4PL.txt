Title: Works well, in a large space
Content:
This heater works well, but gosh is it big! We purchased it to heat a small bedroom, but that turned out to be impossible. It is about 3 feet long, and the safety instructions indicate it must be at least 3 feet from any other item in the room - walls, furniture, anything! Completely impractical for a small 10 x 10 bedroom. However, we ended up using it to heat our garage during a construction project, and it worked well for that. The low profile makes it easy to store when not in use, but it does take up a lot of space when it is being used. Controls are easy to use and program for time/temp. So I'd recommend it, but only for large spaces where it wouldn't be a fire hazard near drapes or furniture.

Title: An excellent coffee maker
Content:
This coffee maker has been excellent.  Delivers really hot, delicious coffee in just a few minutes, even with the gold filter (I usually prefer paper filters).  Coffee stays hot for over an hour, and you can take the carafe anywhere.  I've been pleasantly surprised, because I got a great deal at Peet's on it ($35).  Would gladly have paid twice as much.  One small complaint is that the cup markers are hard to read without my glasses.

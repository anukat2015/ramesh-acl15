Title: Very nice small heater
Content:
Bought two about a month ago. Then bought another two within a week because we like them so much. They are compact, low power consumption, quiet (actually no sound), effective and safe (not too hot besides the safety shut off mechanism when fall). They are perfect for heating a small area in a big room which you can not afford to heat up. I have a huge office in my basement which is very cold (~52 degrees). With the small heater about 2 feet in front of my feet, I feel really very comfortable. My feet used to be very cold and uncomfortable before I bought these heaters and now I feel really good. Yes, it has no thermostat, but is not a problem for me. Its plastic body seems pretty solid for me and it is light and compact to move around. Comparing to my other 1300-1500 W heaters, this 300 W heater makes me happy to run anytime I want without worrying about my electric bill (less than 5 cents/hour for each of the heaters).

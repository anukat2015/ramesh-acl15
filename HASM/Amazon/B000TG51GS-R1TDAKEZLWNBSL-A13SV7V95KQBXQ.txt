Title: It's a utility fan! Loud & shaky...
Content:
DeLonghi puts this under Ceramic Heater (instead of Utility Heater which is one of their other categories) but Lowe's calls it a Ceramic Utility Heater which is more accurate.  This thing is quite loud & shaky.  If you use this on a carpet, that will muffle the vibrating sound, if you use this on hard flooring, the vibrating noise may be too loud for you.

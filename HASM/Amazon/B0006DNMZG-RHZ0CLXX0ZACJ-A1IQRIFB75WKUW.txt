Title: stopped working after a year of light duty
Content:
I bought this heater last winter to use in my bathroom, because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports for function and price. I used it daily for about 3 months, typically less than an hour per day, and it performed as expected. 
This winter, I began using it the same way. It was fine for several months until a few days after it passed the one-year purchase anniversary. Then it abruptly stopped working. I suspect that the on-off dial failed, since the unit is still getting power. Most of time, I unplugged it rather than using the dial, since I don't like to leave a heater plugged in, but this time I used the dial and the heater never warmed up again.
Last year when I bought this heater, the Amazon price was very low and included Prime shipping. I might have considered buying another at a similar price and hoping that it would prove more durable. But now the price has gone up by around $20 and it is only available from an outside merchant, with extra shipping. It doesn't seem worth it for a product that only functioned for about 6 months of light duty. I'm looking for another small heater.

Title: 4G 16GB ipod nano needs minor improvements
Content:
I really enjoy this ipod nano. Several features such as Genius and Shake to shuffle. You have the option of turning these features off. Crystal screen is extremely clear with good picture quality. Some minor improvements need to be made such as the volume being audible even when you turn it all the way down. Some skipping takes place during music burning. Need an updated Itunes to make the most of this nano.

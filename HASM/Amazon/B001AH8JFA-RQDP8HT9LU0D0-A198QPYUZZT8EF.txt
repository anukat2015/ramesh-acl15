Title: Very comfortable and quite
Content:
This heater is very confortable, quite. With oil filled radiators I recommend putting a small fan in front of them.This way the heat is distributed to the room quicker, and more even. This product is very nicely designed , and does it's job very well.I highly recommend this heater. I am especially very impressed with excellent and fast service of Geroy's. The item arrived in 2 days via UPS.

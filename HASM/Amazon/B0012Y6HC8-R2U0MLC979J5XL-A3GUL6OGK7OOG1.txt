Title: Very Good - but learning curve for great
Content:
I bought this camera because of a recommendation by Consumer Reports. I had a 35mm SLR in the past and was looking forward to a digital SLR. My first day out, I stuck to the 'Full Automatic' mode and reviewed the photos with some disappointment. While some were very nice, others weren't. The wide range for the auto focus points often stole the focus from a more distant object to a closer one. This was not easy to overcome in full auto mode. After reading the manual I selected 'Program Mode' and was able to program the auto focus point to just use the one I wanted. These photos came out much, much better. I also played around with some of the other settings and found that the close-up mode works very nicely. I have not yet played around with some of the more technical aspects of the camera, but it gives lots of room to grow. I'm very happy with the camera and glad I bought it.
Bottom Line: this is not a 'point-and-shoot' camera and should not be considered a high end replacement for one. This camera is great for a weekend photographer, or photo hobbyist. Just be prepared to spend some time learning the camera, the menus and settings. Then take a few hundred pictures and find its limitations and possibilities.

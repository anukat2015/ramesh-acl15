Title: Image Quality
Content:
Pretty darn good camera for it's price.  Image quality is very good. Have to zoom in pretty far to see any blurring or pixelization. Ease of operation is very good as well. Had qiute a bit of it figured out in a couple of days, to get me rolling, and I haven't even scratched the surface on what it may do.
Unfortunately the optional telephoto lenses from 300mm to 600mm range in price from around $1700 to almost $9500 respectively.  So I'll stick to what I have.

Title: awful experience
Content:
This product,DeLonghi 700T,was about the worst purchase that I have ever made.The unit ran for 10 mins and then shut off.After several attempts,we finally found the service center that replaced the fan motor--after a 4 month wait for the part.But that did not fix the problem--the unit shuts down after a short run.Because all of this has taken so long,Delonghi says that the warranty is now limited and that I have to take the unit to a service center 50 miles away.It has been close to 2 years and I still do not have a functioning air conditioner.

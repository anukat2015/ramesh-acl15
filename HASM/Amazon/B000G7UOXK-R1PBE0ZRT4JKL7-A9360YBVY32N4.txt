Title: Fine as a fan, but doesn't cool
Content:
It has everything you want of a fan - timer, 3 speed, variable direction, remote control, but don't think this will in any way reduce the temperature in the room - at best you get a fan with built-in humidifier.
It comes with ice packs, but using these doesn't make any difference either, and good luck getting them back out after using them - the hole you have to drop them in is the same size as the ice pack, so once you get your hand in there and get a grip on them, you can't get your hand back out.
Update: Died after less that two years.

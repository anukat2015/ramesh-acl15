Title: Does the job...
Content:
It is what it is...a long handled cordless hand vacuum.  Works well, moves effortlessly, eats dust bunnies. I can zip it around entire downstairs hadwood floor area (800sq/ft) quickly picking up all the little debri that I track in on my boots. I got a really good price for mine at $50.00. Not sure if it I would spend a whole lot more than that for one though.

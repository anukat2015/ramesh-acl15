Title: Fantastic camera for the price. Amatuer and pros alike will find useful.
Content:
Fantastic small form factor in a surprisingly high-quality image. Have been using this camera for travel assignments and on-the-go when I need to spend a lot of time wandering around, and is an excellent light-weight and inconspicuous body. Still works with many Nikon lenses, though you'll need to manual focus with some of them.
Highly recommended, I plan on using this till 2012. A++

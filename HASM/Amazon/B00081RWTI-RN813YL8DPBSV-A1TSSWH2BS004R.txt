Title: Great product
Content:
No complaints, but one thing you should keep in mind:
If you're used to the classic "dump grounds here, dump water here, flip this switch, wait" coffee maker, be prepared for a bit more maintenance.  Nothing difficult, but you need to clean the grinder between each use and remember to swap the water filter once a month.  Also, it's a lot easier to forget things that are obvious on a simpler machine.  For instance, if you leave used grounds in the basket and add new beans to the grinder or fill the reservoir without emptying the carafe, you'll have quite a mess on your hands (I wish I could say this hasn't happened to me).

Title: Cheap and expensive
Content:
My recommendation is to wait for the next generation or even two for the Zune.  I experienced the Zune and iPod for the first time during the last couple of weeks.  The Zune felt cheap and clunky compared to the iPod.  I thought the iPod had better screen resolution and seemed like better quality.  The Zune is still working out bugs finally working with Vista but the wireless seems quarky.  No one has the Zune yet so no one to share with.  The FM doesn't seem to work very well on the Zune having a lot of static with the stations it connects with.  It would seem Microsoft would put better quality FM with the Zune since it is one of the features iPod doesn't have.  
The iPod seemed better polished and the interfaces worked better.  I would wait if I were you for a year or so before getting a Zune.  Don't throw your money away at a first generation product that still has to many bugs to work out.

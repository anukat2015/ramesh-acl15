Title: Horrible overpriced player
Content:
Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player. It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files. It forces you to use the dumb Sony software. It costs more than an IPOD.. In short.. buy something else. Sony get your act together.. You invented this category and now you have lost it

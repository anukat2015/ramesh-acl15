Title: Very good, inexpensive dSLR
Content:
This is my first dSLR camera. While most stores display the XTi and eventually the XSi, the XT is adequate for my needs. I believe I do not need the potentially ineffective sensor cleaning feature, live view, eye proximity detector, extra focal points, or the extra resolution. I ordered the XT with the EF-S 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 IS lens for only around $180. After buying the 4 GB Sandisk CF card I spent less than $700 total. A few years ago, I would only be a able to buy a high-end point and shoot camera. In the near future, I plan to buy the EF 50mm 1.8 II prime lens as well. 
Pros:
-Inexpensive
-Compact; great for traveling, even fits in my backpack with my 18-55mm IS attached.
-Very good ISO performance from 100-800. 1600 is OK
-Handy back-lit monochrome LCD display
-Built-in flash for starting out in dSLR photography and hot-shoe for future external flash
-Very fast response
-Shutter, aperture, and focus point display in viewfinder.
-Custom functions allow some tweaking. 
Cons:
-Changing white balance, ISO, AF mode, and light metering requires use of the color LCD screen that is hard to see in sunlight. I wish the shortcut buttons just toggle through the settings and that I could see the resulting changes on the monochrome LCD.
-No spot metering
-Thumb wheel is too firm to easily rotate
-CF pins may be easy to bend resulting in expensive repairs

Title: Nikon D200 Rocks
Content:
Since I bought My Nikon D70 as my first Digital SLR. I did became a Nikon products loyal fan. My Personal opinion on Canon vs Nikon, they are both good company. So it just a matter of personal preference. I finally bought the Nikon D200 with 55-200mm VR lens. Just like all the reviews here said. What a wonderful piece of equipment perform excellent and flawlessly. I decided to keep my D70 as back up. I'am a happy camper.

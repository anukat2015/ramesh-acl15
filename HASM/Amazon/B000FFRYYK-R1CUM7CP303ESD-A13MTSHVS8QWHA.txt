Title: Excellent coffee maker
Content:
We've had our Bunn BTX-B for several weeks now and have been very pleased with it.  Initial set up is easy enough, just be sure to follow instructions carefully.  The thermal carafe keeps the coffee piping hot for several hours if you warm the pot before brewing (as recommended with any thermal container).  
Potential buyers need to be aware that this does not operate like a traditional coffee maker.  One pot of brewing water is always being kept hot and ready to pour through the filtered grounds (which is why it can brew a pot in 3 minutes).  Consequently, this is a coffee maker that needs to be regularly used to keep the hot water reservoir from evaporating some of the water away, or plan to simply run a pot of water through it every couple of days.
I do recommend using the Bunn filters.  The extra height of Bunn filters is used by the quick-filling/brewing filter reservoir and while other brands might work some of the time, some of the time they will allow the grounds to run over the top of the filter.
No problems with the lip of the carafe and leaking while pouring, as some have experienced.  Keeping the carafe clean, with attention to oil build up on the plastic pour spout appears to do the trick.
Great tasting coffee, keeps it hot for hours without "cooking" it, very easy to use and clean, and makes a full pot of coffee in 3 minutes.  What's not to like?

Title: It keeps on percolating.
Content:
I've had this Percolator for several years.  It's great and very fast.  I lost the plug-in due to a recent move and had no trouble at all replacing it.  Hamilton Beach also sent me a list of all the replacement parts available for this Model 40616 - should I need them at a later date.  My coffee stays hot and fresh and never scorched.  If I ever have to replace it (which I doubt), I'll get the exact replacement.  It's the best coffee maker I've ever had.  Sincerely,
Carol Markham, Texas

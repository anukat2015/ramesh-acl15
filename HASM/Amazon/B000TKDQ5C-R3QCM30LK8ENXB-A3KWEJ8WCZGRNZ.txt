Title: I'm finally warm!
Content:
So after two longs months of me turning on the heat and then my roommates turning off the heat i finally decided i needed a space heater (bad circulation of heat in our apartment). This space heater was not only very affordable but its small and very modern looking. It warmed up my room in about five minutes. Apart from the noise (kinda like a fan) its perfect!
Finally I can be warm during the long Chicago winter!

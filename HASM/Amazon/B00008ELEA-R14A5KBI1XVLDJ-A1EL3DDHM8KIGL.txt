Title: Percolators are the best
Content:
I am very pleased with this product. I researched the internet so much on deciding what type of coffee maker I wanted. I was going to treat myself and get some massive set up like a kitchenaid coffee pot with a built in bean grinder....the whole 9 yards. After reading many reviews, I decided the percolator was the only way to go. Where a regular drip allows the water to go straight through the filter, percolators allow the water to continuously boil over the grinds, making a flavorful pot of coffee. Farberware is a very trustworthy brand, too. It did take me a few days to determine the grinds to water ratio, but that would be for anyone since we all have different tastes in coffee strength. I highly recommend this product. You will NOT be displeased. :)

Title: Good deal if you need a portable A/C
Content:
Consumer Reports says this portable air conditioner is much less efficient than a comparable window unit.  It's definitely more expensive than a window air conditioner (probably at least double the cost); you're paying for appearance and convenience, not functionality.  (It's easy to disconnect this unit and roll it away into a corner or closet.)
I bought two of these for two rooms with sliding casement windows that posed problems for window units -- and I didn't want to bother with installing and then removing bulky window units every season.  One of the rooms is a very large bedroom with a cathedral ceiling, and the Frigidaire portable air conditioner has no problem keeping it cool.  Your options for placing the unit are rather limited -- there is a somewhat flexible duct that must be run from the back of the unit to a window (or a hole through an exterior wall), and you also need a nearby electrical outlet, preferably on an isolated circuit.

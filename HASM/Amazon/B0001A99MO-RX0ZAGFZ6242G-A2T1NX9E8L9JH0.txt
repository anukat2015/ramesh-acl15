Title: iPod Mini
Content:
I got a pink iPod mini for my birthday in April, and the only problem I had was this: On the way to Florida on the plane, my ipod just started skipping through songs and wouldn't play anything. So we got to Florida,I charged my ipod up (the battery was dead, too) with the wall charger, and it worked fine.. until the flight home. Same thing happened. I reset it with holding down the menu and select buttons, and it worked fine. Until about 2 weeks ago. I left my ipod mini in my glove compartment of my car for about an hour (I live in Wisconsin and it's really cold right now in December). I got back in my car and tried to get it to play, and no luck. I reset it and figured it would be fine, but I looked and the battery was dead even though I charged it before I left. So I recharged my ipod for a few hours when I got home, but ever since it's been working half the time and just freezing up the other half. I'm so fed up I'm thinking about buying a new iPod.. maybe the nano but I hear the screen cracks. Hmm.

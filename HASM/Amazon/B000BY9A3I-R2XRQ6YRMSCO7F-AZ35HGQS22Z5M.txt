Title: Great vac!
Content:
I just received this vacuum today and instantly vacuumed the house in less than 30 minutes. Very light-weight, attractive and smart.
I didn't even open the manual guide and figured all the features out right away. The things I really like is the swivel vacuum head which absolutely fits and turns into every corner and angle,the ease of emptying the canister, the power slider at your fingertip, retractable power cord and the extendable handle that has many different slots for different heights.
Overall, excellent vacuum for $130!!!

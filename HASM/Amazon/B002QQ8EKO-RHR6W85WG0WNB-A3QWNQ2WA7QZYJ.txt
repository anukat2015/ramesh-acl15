Title: Much better deal than a macbook pro.
Content:
Shop around.  You might find this for $800.  If you can find it for $800 it so much better than paying the extra for a Macbook Pro.  I can't tell you where I got it for $800 (MicroCenter).
Why I like it:
-cheaper than a macbook pro but with a bigger hard drive
-thin and light
-long battery life, both in hours of charge and years of use
-does not get hot like most laptops
-nice casing...although it is plastic, it is not worth spending the exrta for aluminum
Why I don't like it:
-still expensive compared to what you can get for a Windows based system
-still does not play certain Windows apps
-does not have firewire input (only an issue if you want to pull video off of a Camcorder from the first decade of the new century)
-does not have a memory card slot (for SD or other cards)

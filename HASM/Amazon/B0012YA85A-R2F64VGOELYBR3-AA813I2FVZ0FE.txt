Title: Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP SLR Camera
Content:
We love this camera!  It's a bit complicated to learn, but has a lot of features and the quality is great.  I'm anxious to get some other lenses to use now. We purchased it mainly because our daughter is taking an advanced photography class, but I'm also having fun playing around with the settings and learning digital photography.  I wouldn't say it's professional, but it's a very good camera to start out with.

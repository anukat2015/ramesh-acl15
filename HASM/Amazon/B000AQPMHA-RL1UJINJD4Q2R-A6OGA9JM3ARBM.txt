Title: best ever!!
Content:
this is the best coffee maker that I have ever used. I was little worried about the level of noise it makes. But mine makes very minimum noise. Cup sizes are perfect. I was almost get B60 for three cup sizes. But I do not need other fancy features of B60 and B40 is just simple and perfect for me. And I was also little concerned about watery taste of coffee since I drink Starbucks coffee black, but dark k-cups taste very good. I will recommend this to other buyers who is looking for simple but great way to make your own coffee at home.

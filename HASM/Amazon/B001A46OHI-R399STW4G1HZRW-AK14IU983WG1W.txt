Title: Great heater at an inexpensive price
Content:
On the night that the temperature dipped to 19 degrees, my furnace cut out.  We were in a bind on a very cold night, so I quickly checked Lowes and compared the heaters they had to the reviews on Amazon.  I needed a heater immediately so could not wait to have one sent to me.  I decided to take a chance on this little heater even though, at the time, there were only two reviews on it (but each giving it five stars).
We made a trip to Lowes and came home with three of these little nuggets and I have to tell you, I was shocked at the performance.  I have had much more expensive heaters that did not do the job this does.  One heater will heat a small room (approximately 10X12) with no problem.  I purchased three and they heated One large room and two smaller ones; all with open spaces.  
The thermostats don't seem to be accurate as someone mentioned, but I didn't care, it helped me out of a bad spot, and at a bargain price.  I would highly recommend this product.

Title: Must Have for New Parents
Content:
Tired of always missing my new baby's smiles because of shutter-lag, I researched DSLR's and found this one to be the best one for our new family.  The Nikon D40 was also in the running, but because I had friends and other family with this Canon XT, I thought I could get more help if I ran into trouble with it.  
This camera is so easy to use and the photos are brilliant.  I never read the book or any instruction, just pulled it out of the box and started taking pics with it.  The colors are super-vibrant and the clarity of the photos is excellent.
This is also a very fast camera.  There is virtually NO lag when pressing the button and only a very short lag while it is writing to the disk.  I think that this could be sped up though by adjusting the photo size and other properties on the camera.
For the price, I think this is a great entry level DSLR and I would  highly recommend it.  
FYI-we decided not to get the newer XTI with 10 megapixles because we would rather invest less money into the camera body and spend more on a better lens to go with the camera.  That was just our preference, but at only six hundred dollars, I feel this was a steal.
Thank you for reading this.

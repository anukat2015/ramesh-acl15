Title: 2 serious problems over the old one
Content:
Two disappoints which caused me to return the new ipod nano.
1) poorer battery life compared with the 3rd generation
2) not compatible with the ipod accessories such as speaker systems.
Apple, with its ipod success is not concerned about customers who have invested $$ in accessories. I talked to the apples sales and tech  support and their attitude was unacceptable. Apple is becoming worse than microsoft.
Apple can fix this by providing a free adapter that converts from new to old plug format. Will they? I hope so.

Title: works great
Content:
This portable heater works well, and it is very easy to roll from place to place.  It will definitely heat a room. If I shut the bedroom doors, it heats my living, dining and kitchen areas (about 700 sq feet.)  I don't know yet if my electricity bill is going to go down, but I know when I turn this heater on it does not cause a little spike in my surge protector like the little space heater does.  I recommend it.

Title: Worked only 3 weeks
Content:
I'm very disappointed with this heater. It did heat fine, but it quit working after only 3 weeks. The quality is poor and it's a waste of money. The remote was very hard to read unless you hold it under a bright light. The heater also gave off an unpleasant odor while it was running. Don't waste your time or money on this unit.

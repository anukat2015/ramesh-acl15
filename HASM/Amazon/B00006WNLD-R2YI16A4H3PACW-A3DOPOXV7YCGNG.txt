Title: Worth every cup
Content:
This product is worth more than the $14.00 that black and decker is charging(I'm sorry $13.77)As far as I'm concerned the pot has already paid for itself because there's no more waste.I set up the coffee pot for my wife everynight all she does is press the button in the morning and presto one cup of coffee.I've taken the advice from another review and use the number one filter,although it has a built in filter.I purchased several items from amazon,but this is by far the best bang for your buck.

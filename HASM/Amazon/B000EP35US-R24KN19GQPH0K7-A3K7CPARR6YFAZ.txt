Title: Excellent product!!
Content:
I received this product as a gift from my company Christmas party!  I was a little nervous since I am a PC person.  WOW! It was very easy to get set up.  This is a very nice MP3 player for someone who is looking for a music player only without a lot of bells and whistles.  My only complaint would be with the ear buds; they sound great but do not fit in my ears properly.  Certainly not a reason to send it back!!

Title: Zune 16 GB
Content:
After owning a video iPod for a few years, I finally decided to get a Zune after getting tired of terrible Apple customer support and product reliability.  First of all, the interface is very easy to use and moves very quickly.  The touch pad works flawlessly and the two buttons are in well placed positions.  The audio playback is very good quality and plenty loud, and included headphones are also very nice and comfortable in comparison to others (iPod).  Watching videos is nice and smooth, although the small screen makes them a bit harder to watch.  The 2 new games included are a very nice feature, with Hexic being one of the greatest things to ever come to a handheld device.  All the new wireless features also work very well and have a decent range, and the radio works its purpose excellently.  I would definitely recommended this over any iPod thanks to the better features, software, and pricing.
5/5

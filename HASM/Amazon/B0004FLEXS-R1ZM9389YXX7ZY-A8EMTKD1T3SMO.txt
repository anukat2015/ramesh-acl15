Title: Almost Perfect
Content:
This is the second one of these coffeemakers that I have owned and used.  I love the no-drip spout and the unit's overall performance.  The only glitch was that the plastic clips that secure the lid to the pot were broken upon arrival, but it is still functional in this condition.  I will buy another one of this exact model in the future if one is still available.

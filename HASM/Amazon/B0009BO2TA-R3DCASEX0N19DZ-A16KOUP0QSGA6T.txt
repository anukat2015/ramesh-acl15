Title: Love this little cutey
Content:
We got this vacuum after a long search for a low priced canister. It was adorable, which caught my eye, and a Hoover which caught my husbands. 
 We had wall to wall carpeting in our house then and it performed far better than we expected. It cleans up all pet hair, plus you can clean hard surfaces in a breeze. 
 The handle does come off easily, which can be good and can be very frustrating. The bags are also kind of obnoxious, you have to order them from Hoovers web site. But theyre inexpensive and really great for allergies. My husband and I have both noticed a marked improvement in our dust allergy since getting this. 
 I would definitely reccomend it to friends and family.

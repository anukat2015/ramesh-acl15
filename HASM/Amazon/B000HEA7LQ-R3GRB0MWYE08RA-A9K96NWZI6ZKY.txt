Title: Fantastic
Content:
We were looking for a solution for heating a 700 sq. ft. guest space with high ceilings. It's an architectural house, as they say, which means you can do odd things (like putting a garage heater into a living space) and everyone accepts it as part of the master design.
Prior to Mr. Heater, we tried two other heating solutions for the space. One was a glass-front heater that looked like a wood burning stove, and the other was a gas baseboard heater. The first one worked well. It heated the space in about twenty minutes. The problem was that it took up too much floor space. The baseboard heater was a bust; our portable heaters did a better job.
Mr. Heater is, as it says in the summary above, fantastic. It can heat the room by 11-degrees in about five minutes. It's not nearly as quiet as our first heater but, oddly, it's much quieter than our failed baseboard heater. Whatever noise it makes isn't annoying, unlike the baseboard heater that generated an odd pitch and vibration.
Given how fast Mr. Heater heats the space, we have no need to preheat the room and we can run it for short stretches.
Point of reference: We live in Los Angeles, so 50-degrees is freezing on our scale. 
p.s. We called the factory before buying the unit. The reps were quite helpful.

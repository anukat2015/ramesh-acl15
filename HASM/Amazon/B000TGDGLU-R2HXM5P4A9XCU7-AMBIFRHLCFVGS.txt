Title: Okay if it's not too cold
Content:
During our recent cold weather here in the NW, my furnace broke so I had to rely on my oil-filled DeLonghi radiator and a smaller Honeywell ceramic heater to keep warm. The DeLonghi does okay keeping a small room warm - unless the temps get into the teens and below, which has been the case here - where I really couldn't tell it was putting out heat unless I was standing right next to it.  Also, although this heater has been running continuously for a couple of weeks, that "new oil" smell has not dissipated and it is very irritating to the nose.  The other DeLonghi I have (the more expensive model) burned through that odor in two or three days so I thought this one would do the same.  It hasn't.  I also find the ComforTemp heat control confusing and difficult to set, as opposed to the thermostat setting on the DeLonghi TRD0715T which is much more intuitive.
For extremely cold weather (it was 2 degrees on my deck yesterday morning), the smaller Honeywell ceramic heater that has a fan does a much better job of reaching and maintaining a comfortable level of warmth in the room I use the most often which is a long, narrow room approx. 25'x 10'.

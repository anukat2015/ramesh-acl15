Title: Great little heater
Content:
I've been using this heater for over a month and highly recommend it.  I use it in my bathroom in the morning and it heats the room nicely as long as the door is closed as the heater is not made to heat a large area.  Once the room is heated you can lower the setting and this keeps the room comfortable.

Title: Terrible machine
Content:
This vacuum is a joke. It spits out everyhting you vacuum a half a second after it picks it up. I have dogs and if it gets one strand of pet hair in it, it clogs up. It is a terrible product. I read the positive reviews so I expected so much better. What a shame to have wasted 220 on an item that is a worthless piece of junk!

Title: Expanding the great Canon Digital SLR line
Content:
I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels "too light"...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves.
Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price.
No downsides that I can think of...

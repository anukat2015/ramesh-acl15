Title: Best coffee maker at any price
Content:
This is the best coffee maker that I have ever owned. It's easy to program, the pot does not drip, and makes great coffee. The low price is an added bonus. 
One modification I did make is to remove the little lever under the grounds basket, as I never use the sneak a cup feature. It could be a potential source of overflow problems. 
I highly recommend this coffee maker.

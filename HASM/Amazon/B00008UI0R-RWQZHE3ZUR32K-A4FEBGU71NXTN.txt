Title: buy this vac
Content:
I bought this vacuum as a "touch up", in between the cleaning crew, vacuum.  I have Kirbys and Hoovers and Kenmores.  This little thing  out performs them all.  I was not expecting such performance.  I have only had it for a week so I cannot speak on long term satisfaction but I can say my expectations were very much surpassed.

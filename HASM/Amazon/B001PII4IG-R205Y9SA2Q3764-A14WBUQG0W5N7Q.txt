Title: Sony Vaio - all sony vaio's ive seen (lack of a latch!)
Content:
I purchased this item and immediately noticed it had no latch! no magnet, and no way to keep it shut. Knowing this would be a problem I went to return it at bestbuy and they wanted a 15% restocking fee so I ended up keeping it. God what a mistake that was, I was on my way to class, I'm a college student and I have a lot of paperwork mind you, and I went to open my laptop and the screen was scratched, because apparently a cd got wedged in between the screen and the keyboard! - I called sony and asked for a replacement screen and they said that this was an outside of warranty issue. Heres my problem with this, I spent all this money on a laptop, only to realize that it didn't come with a latch! even after the salesperson sold it to me telling me it had a way "some how" to latch, and then after the first year of owning it, keep in mind my screen is now scratched... the hinges have come loose! - so stuff gets in the computer even more now... This computer would be great, if sony didn't have such a crappy warranty policy about replacing a damaged product, clearly caused by an idiot engineer that DIDN'T want to put a latch on my laptop! Thanks for nothing guys...

Title: Ceramic Heater
Content:
Purchased the electronic space heater with remote via Amazon.com!  (on sale for just $25 bucks!  You know I'm excited, right?!!)  Who knew you could purchase other items besides books via amazon!  Have enjoyed the use of the heater thus far.  No issues what so ever.  Heats a small room efficiently; even heats a large basement!  Heats fine. Remote works well.  If you knock the heater over, its auto turn off works!  This is the third honeywell heater  I've purchased!  I'm happy and you will be also!!
p.s.  a thief stold one of my honeywell heaters and I'm sure he's enjoying its use, too!

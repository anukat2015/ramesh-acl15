Title: Love this i-Pod!
Content:
I have had this iPod for 2 weeks now, and at first the only thing we had to complain about was my Dad's  software for his iPod was already on our computer, so when we downloaded my software for it, his songs were already in my iTunes.....but we fixed it. Before i had this iPod i had the iPod shuffle (1st generation) and it wouldnt store enough songs and i wanted something bigger, so me and my parents decided to split the cost for this one! I already have 234 songs on it, and ALOT of pictures! Today i am going to put videos/movies/tv shows on it! All in all I love this iPod!

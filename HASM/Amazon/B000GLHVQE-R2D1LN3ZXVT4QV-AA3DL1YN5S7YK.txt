Title: Great Heater
Content:
Great little heater.  We use it to heat our whole apartment in place of the baseboard heating we have.  It heats fine and costs a lot less.  It looks great, works great, is light and doesn't become hot to the touch.  We run it nearly 24/7 and it never shuts off from overheating.  Grab one.

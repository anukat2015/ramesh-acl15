Title: Travel in a Vehicle with a Dog - Then Buy This!
Content:
I have a Black Lab/Beagle mix who goes with me everywhere I can take him.  He's 15 and as active as a 5 year old.  His hair gets on everything and my shop-vac only gets some of the hair off my seats and floor of my F150 truck.  I saw this advertised at Target with the "motorized pet brush" and figured I'd give it shot.  It works great!  It picks up all the dog hair that seems to be inbedded in the upolstry of my truck.  All you have to do is open the dump basket and see the amount of hair and dust that it has picked up to realize how good this really is. You have to make sure that the power brush is flush to the area you are vacuming otherwise it will not pick up anything.  The only downside is that the full charge doesn't last too long.  It was good enough for a complete vacuming of the front bench seat but started to die down after that.  It still had enough power to do the back seat and floor.  I would guess that it stays at full power with continuous use for about 15-20 minutes and then it starts to slow down.  I never let it completely discharge - I don't trust that instruction; so when I have used at length or it has been sitting for awhile I will put it back on the charger until the charging light comes up green again.  If you are going to some type of formal gathering and don't have time to pull out the shop-vac and clean your vehicle -or you forget, then this little gem can be worth its weight in gold.

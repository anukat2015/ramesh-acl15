Title: I love this in my kitchen
Content:
I got this lovely coffeemaker as a Deal of the Day for $149, but I think it's worth it for $199.  I'm the only coffee drinker in my household.  It's great to get up in the morning, see the blue lights of the Keurig, pop in a pod, and have a fantastic cup of coffee in a minute.  Nothing to clean up.  No wasted half pot of coffee to throw away or microwave cold.  I need some caffeine when I wake up, and this a pleasant easy way to get my coffee.  I feel somewhat bad about throwing away the little K-Cups, but on the other hand I'm not throwing away coffee I don't drink.  This is a great concept, makes my life more pleasant.

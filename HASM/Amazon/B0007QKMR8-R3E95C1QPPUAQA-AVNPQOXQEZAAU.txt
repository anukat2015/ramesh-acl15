Title: Love-Hate Relationship
Content:
I love the size and potiential of this camera.  The fact that I could use my old lens was what caused me to only look at Canon Cameras.  
PROBLEM:  White Balance was way off. When I took pictures, the blues did not come through. For example, I took one picture of a fortress in Corfu, Greece that had a background of a blue sky with a few white clouds with the new Canon XT and my wife's $300 5mp Sony.  The Sony showed blue skies and white clouds and the Canon showed all grey skies.  No distinction between the clouds and the sky.  I shoot this in the automatic (green square) mode.  
I worked with the professional photogragher on our cruise ship and he agreed there was a problem.  I returned the camera and obtained a refund.  I was disappointed.  One final comment:  I am not a professional photographer so this could be pilot error!

Title: Great for a small space heater.
Content:
This space heater is a lot like a camp fire.  It's too warm if you're too close, too cold if you're too far, but if you stand the right distance away and turn in place a lot, I imagine you can keep pretty comfortable.  I bought it for emergency warmth and to replace a similar space heater that was hot air based.  It warms a small room as well as the hot air based one (which means not well at all) but at least it warms from a greater distance and can possibly warm several people at once if they stand in the right spot relative to it.  My comfort zone was between 2 and 6 feet from it, depending on the temperature of the room.  At 10 feet away it made me feel like the room was 4 degrees hotter.  At 6 feet away it was more like 10 degrees hotter.  And at 2 feet away it was like 50 degrees hotter (Fahrenheit).
Pros: Works to take the chill off a slightly chilly room.  Silent.  Seems safe.
Cons: Poor quality control.  My unit was not symetrical in the spacing of seams.  Some seams between the parts that comprise this heater were wider on one side of it than the other.  Poor quality control means a product that may or may not fail right out of the box, or in a dangerous way.  There were at least three irregularities in my unit.  As a result, I will never leave this on without close supervision.  I am still very glad I bought it and it works fine, but this isn't exactly six sigma.  I am just very careful with hot electricity guzzling appliances that look poorly slapped together.

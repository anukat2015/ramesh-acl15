Title: Archos 604 wifi
Content:
Once through the learning pains, the unit proves its worth.  The wifi is the most singularly important feature to me, since I can play downloaded movies and songs from my computer's hard drive without transferring them to the archos.  You will need the DVR adapter and the two codecs that Archos sells to make it work.  I think it's a ripoff for Archos to sell these piecemill since you need them to make the unit work, but they never ask me for advice anyway.  Don't forget, that there's a secretly hidden reset switch under the battery.  They must have thought hard and long before deciding where to hide that little gem.

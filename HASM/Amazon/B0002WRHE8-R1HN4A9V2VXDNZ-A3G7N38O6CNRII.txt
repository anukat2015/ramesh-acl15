Title: Overpriced, under accessorized
Content:
In addition to the price listed here, be prepared to spend $30-50 more.  This uses a 1# propane tank that lasts a few hours (I haven't wasted my time finding out just how much time though).  If you want to use this as a heater for your garage or outbuilding, you need an adapter hose to connect to a 20# tank (17#, 18#, etc) that Mr. Heater conveniently offers for over $20.  And to run the fan you need either 4 'D' batteries (that's 4 more batteries everytime these die) or an AC adapter that is not included, for another $20.  
Look for other brands and models before buying this one.

Title: Great w/ an addtl. fan but water is a hassle to change.
Content:
It gets really hot in our S. Californian Apt (no air conditioner) and I bought this to help with that.. It does lower the air temperature by about 3-4 degrees with straight tap water. The only problem is it's not easy to drain this unit & it has to be drained or water changed every 2 days. The fan aspect works okay at blowing cool air at the spot it's set to. I recommend using this in conjunction with another fan like a Lasko and you will cool the room even more. That's how I use it and it works!

Title: Lots of storage, nice display
Content:
I like the 160 storage capacity. It can be used as a high capacity portable drive while having plenty of room for all my music. Battery seems to charge faster.
I wish the entire iPod series had better fidelity.
The new classic models won't fit in the earlier series clickwheel charging bases, so line-out is not available to hook up to your stereo. I rate it minus one star that I have to use the headphone jack to hook up to my hi-fi unless I pay more money to apple.
Wish it had come with a wall charger, though it does charge quickly on the USB wire.

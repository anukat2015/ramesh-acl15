Title: Gone Digital
Content:
Finally went big time digital.  Have a Canon FTb 35mm w/lenses(don't fit this new camera)
tired of film processing by outside companies.  Now I can take the shot, see what I have , adjust if necessary.  On auto mode, it's a point and shoot that's pretty well fool proof for just general shooting.  I've had it for a week plus and just starting to use some of the features.  Short learning the curve.  I bought the kit and the lenses is very usable.  Just ordered a Sigma APO 70-300mm lenses to increase my capabilities.
The camera was easy, the lenses are a bear!!!  So many choices and so many price ranges.
Overall I've taken and enjoyed more pictures this week then in the last year. Have a point and shoot that wasn't reallly what I wanted, but will remain a fine edition to my camera bag.  My recommendation - GO FOR IT.  Best in it's class (this week any way)

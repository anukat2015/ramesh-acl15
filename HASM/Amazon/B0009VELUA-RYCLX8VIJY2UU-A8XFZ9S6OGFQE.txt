Title: Warning!  Do Not Buy!
Content:
At first I thought this coffee maker would be the ideal product for my wife and me, so we splurged and blew $99.  The first problem appeared readily when we filled the reservoir.  If you don't heed my warning, and you purchase this item, make sure you also obtain a large funnel or at least own something that can pour accurately into a 1 inch wide opening.  Otherwise, place the machine on a towel as water drips behind and under it as you attempt to fill the reservoir.  After 4 months we found that the program auto-on no longer functioned.  Then 6 months later my wife said she had to turn the "on" switch  twice to get the coffee maker to function.  When this happened to me as well, I realized that we might not have coffee for breakfast much longer.  Sure enough, a few weeks later, the switch failed completely.
After looking up the warranty, which is a 3-yr one by the way, I called the 800 number to see if there were any service centers near me, which of course there weren't.  The customer service representative was only concerned  with whether we had used the charcoal filter (which we had even though all of our drinking water is already filtered), and whether we had cleaned the maker with vinegar.  Somehow I fail to see how cleaning the machine has anything to do with an electronic switch failure.  At any rate, I finally cried "uncle" and hurled the offending appliance into the dumpster, along with the worthless warranty.  Then we purchased a Hamilton Beach with all the same functions not to mention a one-hand dispensing feature and simpler programming at half the price.  It may not be a ritzy stainless steel cube, but it works fine, so far.

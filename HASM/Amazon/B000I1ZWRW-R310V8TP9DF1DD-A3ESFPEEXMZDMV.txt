Title: Useless LCD Display
Content:
Please note that the LCD display can only be used to check camara settings and play back images.  You can not use the LCD display as a view finder.  In other words you can not frame your pictures using the LCD display. This is a mayor inconvenience for those of us that use the LCD display to compose the pictures.
In my opinion there is no need to have such a large LCD for changing camera settings.  This feature waists battery power.

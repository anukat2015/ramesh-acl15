Title: Great coffeemaker . . . if it worked
Content:
Overall, I was impressed with this coffee maker, except that it had one terminal flaw.  The filter housing swivels out for easy access.  However, the catch mechanism is flawed.  It is flimsy plastic and on the first coffeemaker it broke off.  On the replacement pot it appeared to work fine, until you started brewing coffee.  Then, as water dripped into the coffee+filter, the catch would pop due to the added weight, swing open dribbling coffee all over the counter top.
The company I dealt with was great to do business with.  I explained my problems.  They provided return shipping both times and gave me a full refund.  I would consider a newer model of Braun coffeemaker, but I would want to see the reviews first, to see if they addressed this problem.

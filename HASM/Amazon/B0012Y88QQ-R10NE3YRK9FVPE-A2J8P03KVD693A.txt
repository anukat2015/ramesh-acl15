Title: I Love This Camera
Content:
I have been searching for a good all around camera that will take great Portrait/Sport pictures and is very user friendly. I absolutely found it with the Canon Rebel XSi. I purchased it from Amazon at a great price along with the EF-S 18-55 IS lens which is a very good lens for the price.  I will be looking to buy the Canon EF 70-200 F4L IS and the  50mm in the very neir future to complete my collection.  There is nothing bad I can say about this camera.  Great Job Canon!!!!!

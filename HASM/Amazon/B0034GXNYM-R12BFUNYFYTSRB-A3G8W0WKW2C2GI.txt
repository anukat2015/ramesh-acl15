Title: good purchase
Content:
You won't find any laptop better for $970 without tax. I've searched high and low for the best one and this is what I got.
Pros:
Very strong graphics card, fairly new (couple months old), can handle new games easy
Very quiet, you might think a disc tray may make noise but I assure you it's quiet
Extremely fast, quad core i7, 7200rpm HDD, 4gb ddr3 ram
Great viewing angles for LED screen
VERY good quality built-in microphone, most laptops built-in mics are terrible
Numpad
Cons:
ATI drivers suck, need 3rd party programs to get into advance settings (unlike nvidia)
Base idle heat of about 60, which is kinda high. But expected for a quad core i7.
Somewhat low height of resolution for a 16" screen.
Alot of useless ASUS bloatware
Wish the numpad was a little bigger
Overall the best you could get for the price, you won't find anything near this systems specs for this price.

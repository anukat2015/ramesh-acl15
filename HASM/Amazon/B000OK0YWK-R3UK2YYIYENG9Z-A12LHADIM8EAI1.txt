Title: Screen Self Destructs
Content:
Bought one in Feb.  Last week the screen spontaneously cracked.  Hadn't been dropped or banged.  Googled the issue and found A LOT of other people having same problem.  Called zune and they said nothing about the screen is covered under warranty.  I now have a 30gb paper weight.  Thanks microsoft.

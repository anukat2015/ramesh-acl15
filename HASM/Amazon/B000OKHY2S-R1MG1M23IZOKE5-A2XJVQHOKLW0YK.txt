Title: Inexpensive Cool Air
Content:
I use this unit in Los Angeles, CA.  I have a 500 sq ft 2nd floor apt.  At 4:30 pm, I put two trays of ice in the unit along with 1/3 tank water.  At 6:40 pm, after running the unit for 2 hours, the inside air temp is 85 degrees with a humidity of 34%.  The ouside temp is currently 82 degrees at 22% humidity.  It is normally about 5 degrees warmer and more humid inside my apt than outside at this hour, so while it is possible that this unit has dropped the overall air temp slightly, it should probably not substitute for your air conditioner. When the unit is blowing directly on me, the air temp is comfortable.  I think the air is cooler than a fan, but another in my household thinks it is the same as a fan.  Admittedly, it is close.  The swamp cooler is much less expensive to operate than an air conditioner.  Using a P4460 Kill A Watt electricity meter, this unit uses 0.040 kWh per hour.  My 12,000 btu Sharp room air conditioner uses 1.040 kWh per hour.  At the LA rate of .1236 per Kilowatt Hour, if I were to use each unit 8 hours a day for 30 days, the air conditioner would cost $30.85 per month.  This unit would cost $1.19 per month.

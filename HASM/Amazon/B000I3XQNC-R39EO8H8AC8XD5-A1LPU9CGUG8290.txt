Title: Great Buy
Content:
Bought the Canon Ati body to replace my older EOS 35mm. I can use my existing Canon 28/80mm and Quantaray 100/300mm AF lenses and so saved a bunch of money and have a real good camera with great features. I've fitted a 4GB card and am able to store around 850 full size pictures which will be great for our proposed 2 week safari in Africa without computer.
Thanks Amazon - super service.

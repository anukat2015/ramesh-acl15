Title: Quiet and Effective
Content:
We purchased this refurbed vacuum because our daughter has one and often uses it at night after the kids are in bed. It is one of the quietest machines we have ever used. Although it is no longer available new, the refurbished version looks and acts like new, and for us it is completely satisfactory for everyday jobs.  We have a much heavier upright machine which we used to use for heavy-duty carpet cleaning, but it was noisy and not as convenient for switching between upright and hose nozzle, and was very hard to use on the carpeted stairs.  Don't be put off by comments that the Electrolux Harmony Ultra Silencer is only good for bare floors; we found the included turbo nozzle does the job on carpets quite well, and with the HEPA filter there is no odor of escaping dust like we got from the upright.  We also especially like the feature that allows you to store the "business end" of the hose by slipping it into a little groove in either of 2 places on the body of the machine, thus solving the problem of what to do with the awkward hose when storing it in the closet.  Also the feature that rewinds the cord simply by stepping on a button.  All in all, we made the right choice with this machine.

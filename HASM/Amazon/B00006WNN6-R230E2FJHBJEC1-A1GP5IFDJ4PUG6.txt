Title: Excellent Performance for the Price
Content:
What can you say for a $15 heater? 
Does it work? Yes. 
Does it keep my feet warm? Yes. 
What about general area? I can feel the heat past my desk particularly if I let it run all day. If I place it above the desk then it does a better job for the area.
Reliable? so far so good
How well do the multiple settings work? Great overall. I use the fan and the first heat setting. The fan is nice when the air is off in the building. The heater is perfect for a small area or my feet. However, I have a number of items plugged to one power strip and the second setting trips the power strip. Therefore, all of my comments are based on the lowest heat setting. If I had a seperate power strip/plug-in for this heater then the heat would be even better.
Temperature setting? Works reliably but I tend to change the setting manually.
Overall? $15 bucks gets you what you need for a personal heater (versus a room heater).

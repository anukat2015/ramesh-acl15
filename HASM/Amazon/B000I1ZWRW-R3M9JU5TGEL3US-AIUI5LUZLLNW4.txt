Title: Great price for a greater camera
Content:
It may be at the lower end of Canon's Digital SLR series but it is a great camera in itself which I believe even some professionals use. 
The kit lens is useless. Do yourself a favor and buy a nice lens of your choice with the camera. (I bought the Tamron 17-50 f/2.8)

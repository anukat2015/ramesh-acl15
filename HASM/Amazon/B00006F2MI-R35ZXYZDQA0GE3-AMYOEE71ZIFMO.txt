Title: Too expensive for the hassel
Content:
I received this coffee maker for my birthday. I was so excited. Until I started using it. I am a vet student so I drink a lot of coffee and was looking forward to having fresh ground coffee every morning and evening (gotta study!). Well, everytime I turn the machine on to make a pot, the grinder basket is drenched in steam which creates a kind of coffee grind paste. Then when ever I try to pour fluid out of the carafe, water/coffee spills all over the place (regardless of whether the top is on or not). I will give kudos to the cuisineart folks for customer service. I was so frustrated w/ the carafe spillage that I wrote them a letter and they promptly sent me a new carafe free of charge. It worked great for a week until it started to spill everything again. Next add the fact that there are 6 parts that you have to remove after every use to clean/rinse out and you get a coffee maker that just ends up being a pain in the tush! I gave this machine two stars; 1 star for the fact that the carafe is great at keeping the coffee hot, and 1 star for the fact that it does make a good cup of coffee. I would not recommend this machine except to someone w/ a lot of time available for cleaning up after themselves. I am currently desperately searching for a new machine as I am ready to throw this one out of the window!

Title: We really like the Honeywell Mini Tower Surround Heater
Content:
We really like the Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround Heater for use in different areas of the house and/or garage (next to husband's workbench or when working on cars).  Shortly after receiving 2 of them through Amazon in Nov 2009, we bought 1 more heater from Wal-Mart.  We like the portability, size, heat output, simplicity of use and the price, of course.  It does not make much noise when running, allowing conversation, TV viewing or music to be heard.  The heater is small and light-weight, storing easily in a small spot when not in use.  It's short and attractive enough to not be an eye-sore, yet powerful enough for a single heater unit to heat our large Family Room w/ its cathedral-ceiling.  Because hot air rises, we usually set the ceiling fan to spin in the direction that pushes the newly-heated air back down toward the floor where we can continue to enjoy it.

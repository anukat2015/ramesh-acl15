Title: GREAT FOR THE $$$
Content:
I bought this at Sam's Club last year ($42.25 with tax) - used all winter in our small house to save on the gas bill- it worked Great.....I only had to use a smaller heater in the laundry room (where water lines and animals are) as a supplement...the furnace NEVER came on...right now it is 22 outside and 65 (furthest away around corners to other rooms)-68 inside....have it on low (after 3-4 hours of high in TV time)...we have to run a furnace in the garage so this heater has saved us Alot- highest bill last winter was $205!!
    This year I went a step further and bought an electric fireplace at Lowe's for $200...Fell for all the hype on these darn things-WRONG CHOICE.....it pulls so much electricity the TV went out every time the fan came on...I couldn't even switch back to this Optimus heater with the TV on till tonight when everything COOLED down.
    Remote works perfect- cats love it (they didn't like the fireplace)- couldn't do better than this heater!! and the price is Great at SAM'S!
   UPDATE: wrote this review last night- it QUIT on me tonight!! the alarm light went on and out it went..problem seems to be in the tip over switch...going to see if Sam's will exchange it????
SAM's exchanged it for a new one! SAM'S was Great and I Love this heater!!!!!!

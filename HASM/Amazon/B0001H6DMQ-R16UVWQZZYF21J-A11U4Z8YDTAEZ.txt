Title: A powerful little canister
Content:
I was amazed at the suction power and the versatility of this well designed canister.  It is lightweight and convenient, especially on stairs, while cleaning as well as an upright. When my previous vacuum cleaner became inoperable, I sought recomendations from a leading consumer magazine.  It lead me to this and I am so glad I followed their suggestion.  And what a price from Amazon saving me over $100.00 from the price at a local department store. You won't be sorry.

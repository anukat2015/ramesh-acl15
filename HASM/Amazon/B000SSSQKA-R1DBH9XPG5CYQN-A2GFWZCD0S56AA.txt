Title: Great for what it's made for!
Content:
We bought this vacuum to use on one specific job in our cleaning business.  They have a lot of ceramic type tile that needs to be cleaned and mopped regularly.   The rotating brush works great and suction on this unit is very good.  It really makes cleaning a hard floor thorough and quick.  We liked it so much that we got another to use on oriental rugs.  If rugs are the really thing they are very expensive and you want to be gentle with them.  The rotating bristles on the head are soft and do not rotate extremely fast.  For cleaning a lot of regular carpet, this vacuum would be a bad choice but it's great for what it's made for!

Title: Excellent value for outstanding product
Content:
I am very satisfied with both the product and the service that I received from CPO-Electrolux.  My vacuum shipped very quickly and does a great job of cleaning my carpet.  I also love the attachments conveniently located on the handle.  The  dust compartment is very easy to empty and the self-cleaning filter is very convenient.  No bags or filters to buy.  There is no reason to spend $600 at a store for this vacuum, when the refurbished from CPO-Electrlux comes with a 30 day money back guarantee in addition to a one-year factory warranty from Electrolux.  I have been ripped off with refurbished products in the past, and was a little uneasy about purchasing refurbished again, but I would definently buy from CPO-Electrolux again with confidence.

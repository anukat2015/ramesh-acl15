Title: Zune 30gb
Content:
Bought one last Christmas and I have loved it. I have had no problems with the player. I use it mostly for music and podcasts, but like the games and viewing movies when traveling. The FM workes great and was my news source during hurricane Ike. The Zune software is good for discovering new music and is not buggy like I-Tunes.

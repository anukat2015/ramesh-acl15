Title: Great iPod Shuffle Alternative and Awesome DAP!
Content:
I'm a survivor of two RCA Lyra Micro Jukeboxes.  They both were good for their time (less than a year), but it was time to move on.  I've always admired the SanDisk Sansa Clip from afar, like a pretty girl I was too shy to talk to.
However, I found an incredible deal at Buy.com which allowed me, through Google Checkout, ten dollars off the price.  I ended paying only $61 for my 4GB Clip.  After dealing with the ineptitude of UPS, I got my silver beauty after eight days of desparate waiting and tooth-gnashing.
The Clip is an incredible digital audio player, with amazing sound for its tiny size.  After perusing the official SanDisk forums, I discovered that the Clip catalogues music (in my case, mp3s) by ID tags, I used the fine freeware program MP3Tag to re-tag all of my music files.  After getting my Clip, I dragged and dropped on to the player, and I don't even use playlists.  I just use the "Album" and "Artist" categories to play my mp3s.
I would recommend getting other headphones, as the included earbuds aren't all that great.  I'm using Sony Psyc Stereo clip-on headphones.  I'm carrying the Clip and my headphones in a brand new Case Logic digital camera case I got from Wal-Mart.
I'd also recommend a silicone case to protect the Clip not just from scratches and dings, but from smudges, smears, and fingerprints.  I got one from eforcity on eBay.
All in all, the 4GB Clip is an awesome DAP and a great alternative to the iPod shuffle and most of the other more expensive mp3 players out there.

Title: Over priced & over glorified.
Content:
Step out of Bunn for great coffee. There are many out there. We were shopping for a Bunn & the employee told us, "yes they are good but there's better out there for the price." She gave us a few names & we found our favorite. My husband & i LOVE our Capresso coffee maker which we purchased online. We have had it 4yrs without 1 problem & you get rid of paper filters which we always seemed to run out of or they always let grinds into the pot . Unless you are in a office or need 4 pots a day it's very over priced. Look at the problems people have had. Leaks, grinds in your pot, ect. My father  asked for a new Bunn for xmas then asked me about my Capresso. He assumed it cost alot more than it did. Not only great coffee but attractive as well.  It's fast, dishwasher safe & the carafe is great. For guest it's great to have a second carafe on hand.  Bunn is a good maker but not great. With the cons i've read & seen i wouldn't spend $150 on it.

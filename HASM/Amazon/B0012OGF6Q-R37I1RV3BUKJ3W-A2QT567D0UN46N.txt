Title: Great camera!  Great Price
Content:
This is an excellent camera.  For the price, you get a camera that can do just about anything.  It is fast and the pictures are spectacular.  The only thing I wish it came with was a lense that had greater zoom capacity, but there are so many lenses made for this camera that I just plan to buy another.  This will last us for a number of years.  You can't go wrong with Nikon!

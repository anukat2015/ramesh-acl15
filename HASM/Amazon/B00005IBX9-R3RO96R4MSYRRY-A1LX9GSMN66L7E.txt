Title: Much preferred over other Cuisinart models
Content:
We got a Cuisinart Grind & Brew Thermal (DBG-600) as a gift but returned it and got this DCC-1200 model instead, largely on the weight of reviews that consistently reported difficulties in cleaning the inside grind/brew area of the DGB-600. But we've realized other important differences as well.
A timer's pointless for us, since the kids (and therefore us) wake up at variable times. And a grinder might wake them up earlier than natural.
The DCC-1200, like the DGB-600), has a 24-hour programmable timer and brew-pause function (neither of which we use), a charcoal water filter (which does, indeed, make a taste difference), and a smaller portion brewing option (forcing water through at a different rate, to maximize flavor in less water but the same size grounds container and pot).
The DCC-1200 lacks the grinder we wouldn't use, and a double-walled caraffe that might be nice (both of which the DGB-600 have), but includes a decalcification indicator, a heat-adjustable warming plate (I don't like my coffee HOT, just very warm), and a programmable shut-off (1, 2, or 4 hours) rather than an auto shutoff (which would leave coffee cold before I got to my 2nd cup). 
Also, with a larger grounds bin and caraffe, the DCC-1200 holds 20% more grounds and could make 20% more coffee (60 oz vs 50) - though I tend to make fewer stronger cups.
Fine machine, great coffee, and easy to clean - yahoo. :)

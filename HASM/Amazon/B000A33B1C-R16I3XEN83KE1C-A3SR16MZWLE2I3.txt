Title: Great product, great value.
Content:
I was avoiding turning my heat on for as long as possible. The day I could see my breath in my own house was the day! Luckily, my Delonghi Radiator came in the same day. I was curious as to how well it worked. So, before I actually turned my heater on, I plugged the radiator in. The directions were a little confusing as to how to work the thermostat, but I was able to figure it out. As the oil heated up, I did notice a faint smell and some crackling, but it did not last for long. Here is the greatest part. My home's thermostat, which is across the room from where I placed the radiator, said it was 48 degrees. After about an hour and a half, it had risen to 56 degrees. Once it hit about 62 degrees, I lowered the power level on the radiator. (I had it on high just to get the warmth moving.) I turned my home's heat on, and I noticed already that it is only kicking on about half the time. The house is keeping a much more constant temperature and it's much more comfortable. I was so impressed with this machine, I actually ordered one for my bedroom too! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is sick of the high fuel prices in the winter and need an easy way to supplement their main heating source. This is a wonderful product at an affordable price!!

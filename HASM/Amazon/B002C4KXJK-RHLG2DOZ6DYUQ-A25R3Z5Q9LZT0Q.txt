Title: LinuxBook Air?
Content:
Other than the keyboard, I absolutely love this machine.  The LED screen is bright and crisp just as my MacBook Pro.  I was just about to buy MBA before I read about this laptop.
I installed Ubuntu 9.04 and with minor tweaks (mostly to xorg.conf for the weird screen resolution), got everything working correctly.  I need to use Unix as I'm a software engineer and the performance of this does not disappoint.  It is now the portable machine for the RubyHead.

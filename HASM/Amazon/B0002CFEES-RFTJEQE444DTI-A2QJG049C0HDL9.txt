Title: Toasty warm heater, but blows your fuses
Content:
If you want direct heat and you want it now, buy this heater. It is good for a confined space. My son used it in the bathroom (or should I say reading room).  However, you have to make sure you have an isolated plug as this heater draws the juice. It's nice a quiet. I'd recommend an oil filled heater if you are looking to keep a room warm for a long period of time. This is just a heat-me-up-now type of heater.

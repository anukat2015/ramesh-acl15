Title: disappointing
Content:
I was thrilled to finally find a coffee maker without a carafe.  However, Cuisinart on Demand made the worst tasting cup of coffee I've ever had!  I tried different brands of coffee hoping it would finally produce a good cup of coffee.  No luck!  Every cup tasted like plastic even though all instructions in the manual were followed before use.  Very disappointing.  It's being returned to the store today.

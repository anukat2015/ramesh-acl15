Title: Stop, stop, stop... do not buy!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for a little less than a year. It is a great vacuum, when it works. There is a flaw in the wand or switch wiring that causes the vacuum to shut off and stop working requiring parts replacement to fix. It has happened twice in 6 months on my unit. Looking around online I see a lot of people complaining of the exact same problem... touch the wand extension while the vacuum is running and it shorts out requiring warranty service. This is a major flaw and inconvenience for a $300 vacuum. Do not buy unless you want to be constantly dropping it off and picking it up for service. If your intent on buying... at least look around online first, search for user reports on this vacuum and see how many you find complaining of units that mysteriously stop working.

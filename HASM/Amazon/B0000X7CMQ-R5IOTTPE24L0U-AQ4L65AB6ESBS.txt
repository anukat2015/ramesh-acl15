Title: Most Excellent
Content:
The Honda Accord of coffee makers.  It's very accurate in that the coffee is great every morning, it's very easy to clean and maintain with simple no nonsense controls.  Coffee stays hot in the carafe at least 2 hours (as long as I've kept it there.)  Easy on the eyes in the kitchen, although a red model would fit in better with our countertop appliances.  My old Mr. Coffee carafe had a rim around it that caught coffee when poured which then dribbled down the carafe and made a mess of things and I couldn't keep the machine itself clean.  Maybe a 12 cup model soon?

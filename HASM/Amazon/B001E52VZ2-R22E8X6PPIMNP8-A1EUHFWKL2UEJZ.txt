Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
I bought the Eureka 3670G Boss Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum Cleaner for my son (he is in college and lives in a house with other students). The vacuum cleaner does it basic job well, which is all I expected given the price. The biggest negative for me is the very loud noise it makes. It doesn't come with any bells and whistles - but again, I cannot really complain given the price. I wish there were more canister vacuums that don't have expensive electronic brush attachments meant for carpeting.  Now the choice seems to be between a very expensive (and excellent) Miele model and the basic stripped down version like this one.

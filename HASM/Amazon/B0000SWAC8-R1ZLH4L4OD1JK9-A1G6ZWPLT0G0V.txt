Title: Not the Electrolux you're familiar with...
Content:
buyer beware. the electrolux company that has been doing business in the united states since 1924 has sold the copyright to the name and is currently under the names "aerus" or "lux". go do your research and you'll see what i mean. the 'since 1919' deal that this company mentions means the company has been known as electrolux overseas since then. they are a sweedish/chinese company. not sure why consumer reports gave this machine such a good review. it has decent suction but wow...the parts are VERY cheap. the hose feels cheap. no service stations to get your warranty honored (you've got to mail your machine off which will cost you in shipping). set this machine next to any aerus canister and decide for yourselves. don't just read reviews. go out. look. compare on what you've seen and you'll see what i mean.

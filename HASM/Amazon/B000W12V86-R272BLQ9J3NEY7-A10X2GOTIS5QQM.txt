Title: Very Nice Computer
Content:
This is my 4th laptop and by far the best one I've had yet. The only reason that it received 4 out of 5 stars is the size of it is sometimes too bulky and it is quite a bit heavier then any of my previous laptops so be prepared to have some sort of stand or table to set it on while you are working or your knees will pay for it. This computer came with everything you need to do some serious Video to DVD creations. If you don't plan on packing this computer around much, then you will absolutley love it!

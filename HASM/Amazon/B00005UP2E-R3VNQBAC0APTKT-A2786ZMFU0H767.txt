Title: EXCELLENT!!!! THE BEST!
Content:
I bought this for my mother,and she LOVES it!
(And I've used it myself -Just to test it out compared to my present vacuum cleaner-also well rated & purchased from Amazon.)
It has Fantastic ergonomically designed tools.The Ease of use,is  PERFECT!
Since it's bag less, Emptying & cleaning the dirt collector couldn't be easier! The tools on board are sturdy and effective.
Cons- the carpet cleaner part isn't at strong as others, but it does a very good job cleaning carpets, nevertheless.
Another Con- The hose is a little stiff, & inflexible and maybe prone to cracks and breaks.(If it had a little more rubber it would be perfect.)
GREAT VACUUM! GREAT SUCTION! GREAT PORTABILITY! GREAT EASE OF USE!GREAT PRODUCT!GREAT PRICE!

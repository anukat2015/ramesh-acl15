Title: Been buying Hot Shots for years
Content:
I found this to be the fastest way to heat water for coffee, hot chocolate, instant soup, etc. From experience they last for years. I give HotShots as gifts to my friends who drink cocoa and instant coffee. Sunbeam has made a great product even better! (I have owned  a Hot Shot, the original, and a Hot Shot II. This one was improved by making it easier to dispense into a regular cup.  Don't hesitate to buy this item!!

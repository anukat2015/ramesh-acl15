Title: Nearly perfect no-drip machine!
Content:
I bought this machine to replace a much cheaper Black & Decker coffee maker that had the worst carafe I've ever used. That thing could not pour coffee without dribbling and spilling and I got tired of the constant mess. This Hamilton Beach machine solves that problem completely. I've been using it diligently for a week now and I am very happy with it. I particularly like the adjustable turn-off time and the adjustable strength feature. It keeps my coffee fresh and hot without burning it and since I am home job hunting, it is getting a work out.
It has just one fault that I have found and that is somebody decided to save 10 cents by leaving off an extra (neccesary) foot of power cord. The cord on this is so short that the machine almost must be pushed undeneath the overhead cabinets to reach the power outlet yet the machine is so tall that you can't open it or fill it without pulling it out to the edge of the counter. That puts the power cable up in the air instead of tucked behind my toaster. One extra foot of power cord would have solved this problem. Other than that, it is a great machine. It is tall but the footprint on the counter is smaller than most coffee makers which is a bonus on my too small countertop.
Highly recommended.

Title: Fabulous except for one thing...
Content:
I love this vacuum.  It is perfect for bare floors.  The only downside is that the cord isn't long enough. Those of you with big houses will have to keep unplugging it and moving the plug to another outlet.  Not horrible but inconvenient nonetheless.

Title: Great Canister for the $
Content:
This little Eureka Boss has great suction power.  If you use an upright, but need a canister for furniture, wall carpet corners, window sills, cobwebs, and tight spots under furniture, this Eureka Boss is for you! You can adjust the suction power on the hose handle for delicate curtain jobs which is also great. It's lightweight, versatile, and handles fantastic!  It has a 20' long cord for large rooms, and reaching ceilings is a snap.  I would highly recommend the Eureka Boss for those jobs that your upright won't address!

Title: Economical and efficient heater
Content:
I bought this heater for our bird cage to keep them warm during cool season.  Its radiant model works just great, zero noise, distributes the heat evenly and does not disturb the birds like the regular fan heater models that not only not energy efficient but also really noisy.  And best of all, it uses only 100W - try to compare it to any other regular heater that would eat 750W-1000W minimum.  Got it amortized in less than two months.  The overall dimension is about 16"x22"x1" so it can be placed anywhere.  I'm glad I found this one and Amazon is the best and least expensive place to buy from.

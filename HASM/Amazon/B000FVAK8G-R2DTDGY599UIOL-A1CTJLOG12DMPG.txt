Title: Unreliable at best.
Content:
I purchased this radiator at Target and it worked ok for about a month.  After that the temperature setting malfunctioned and it wouldn't stay where I set it.  It would overheat, sometimes getting to 90 degrees.  This morning it must have shorted out and actually was on fire.  Could be a faulty machine, but if the thermostat starts malfunctioning I'd return it right away.

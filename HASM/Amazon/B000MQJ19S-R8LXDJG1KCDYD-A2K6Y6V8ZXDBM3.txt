Title: Clear navigation & comfortable size, but  quirky performance
Content:
This SanDisk Sansa e250 2 GB MP3 Player with microSD Expansion Slot (Black) came to me as a gift, and was much appreciated, but it's not my favorite player. I use many other SanDisk products, which may be why I expected better performance. 
The positives are plenty: sharp image screen, ease of navigation, compact size, and a microdisk slot for expansion. I add music, videos and pictures by loading a microdisk because tansfering these files is far easier to deal with than using the SanDisk software that came with the device (which is supposed to allow drag-n-drop, though this hasn't worked for me). 
The negatives are a nuisance: sometimes the player just won't turn off, so I must let the battery run down entirely (that took over 24-hours in one occaision). Recharging the built-in battery takes up precious time and one of the limited USB slots on my laptop. While the navigation wheel makes it quicker to switch between functions, it is a nuisance when shoved in a pocket when I'm on the move because any friction seems to change programs or increase volume when least expected.
It's a fine tool for displaying pictures and videos, and the voice notes do come in handy from time to time. The music player itself is good, but the built in equalizer doesn't make much difference in sound quality, at least to my ear. The fat ear buds that came with the Sansa are far too big for my petite ears, so are useless to me. Worst of all, it will not play audio certain files, and I adore books on tape from Audible. 
 My far less expensive RCA MP3 player recognizes a broader range of files, and runs about 10 hours on one rechageable AAA battery, so gets loads more use.

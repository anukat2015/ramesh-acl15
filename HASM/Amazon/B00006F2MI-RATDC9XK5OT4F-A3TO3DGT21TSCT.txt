Title: Easy to clean, great coffee!
Content:
Almost did not buy because I thought, based on other reviews, that it must pour at a glacial rate and be a real pain to clean.  It is no more labor intensive to clean than any other machine and a cup pours in a couple of seconds.  Even my coffee addiction can wait that long!  Best kitchen purchase in years - I love it.

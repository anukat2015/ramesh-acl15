Title: Toasty warm bedroom now
Content:
Bought this heater for my boys room that is always cold since it is located directly above the garage.  The heater we had prior to this one dried out the air which was never good for my allergy/asthma boy.  This heater gives a nice warm feel to the air without drying out.  
Great price.  I am considering buying a second one for the basement.

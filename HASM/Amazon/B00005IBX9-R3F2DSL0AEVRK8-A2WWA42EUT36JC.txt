Title: Just can't get enough
Content:
That's right, I can't get enough of this coffee maker.  Sure, I thought it was a little pricey, but it's been a big hit.  My husband is a major coffee drinker, often drinking 2 pots a day (yes he has a problem).  However, when searching for the new coffee maker I was torn.  The Braun costing approx. $40 dollars less or the Cuisinart.  I have been happy with the choice.  The stronger glass on the pot was a huge selling point especially for clumsy morning hands.  The other was appearance, this metal finish was perfect for my husband who loves the look of industrial.  The coffee is superior, flavorful, strong, and very HOT!  (One promise by the manuf. is that this pot will deliver the hottest coffee with the most flavor).  We love the features my fav is the beep at the end of the brew cycle.  Helps get the husband out of bed.  Downsides:  Small pour opening for water and the lack of ability to adust the strength of the brew which is a feat. in the Braun.  Advantages:  It looks sexy, the adjustable warming time and temp, and according to my checks the filters for this comaired to the Braun are less expensive (saving a little dough & they can be picked up at Bed Bath & Beyond) & the fact that we love it!!

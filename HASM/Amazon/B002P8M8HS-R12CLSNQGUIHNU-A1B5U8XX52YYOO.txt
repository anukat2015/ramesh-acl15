Title: So-So Laptop, would not recommend
Content:
We've had this laptop for 3 months now.  I don't like it.  The keyboard is really weird and the delete button is not easy to get to.  The wireless card cuts out randomly.  The touchpad is not very smooth and makes your hand sore.
It also gets hot on my lap and is a little noisy with the fan.
Plus, I'm not a huge fan of windows 7.  
For the price, it's great.  But if you are not getting a fantastic deal, avoid this laptop and get something better.  My other laptop is a Toshiba Core Duo is much quieter, cold to the touch, and never has problems with the wireless card.  Get a better laptop if you can afford it.

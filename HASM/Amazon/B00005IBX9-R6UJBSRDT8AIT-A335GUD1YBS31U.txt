Title: Makes Excellent Coffee
Content:
There are others who can opine on the walter filter and the programming and the temperature features.  For me, I needed a new coffee maker, and this could get here quick through Amazon.com and was in the right price range.  
Well, I've had it for a few days now, and the coffee is excellent.  I'd recently bought freshly roasted beans and had been using in my old coffee maker.  I thought the coffee was okay, and maybe I just havent' found the right beans.  Well, that coffee maker broke, and I tried those same beans with this maker and Wooooaaaaah, what a difference.  
This coffee-maker makes good coffee.  That's all I need, and that's what it does.

Title: it leaks
Content:
I have purchased (2) of these coffee makers in the past year.  I love the coffee maker, but after owning it for a short period of time, it starts leaking all over the counter.  I have followed the instructions, but it still leaks all over the counter.  If it wasn't for that the coffee maker would be great.  I loved my first one, but it leaked, so I thought I would give it another chance, but it happened again.

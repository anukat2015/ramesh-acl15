This heater is meant to warm the air in an enclosed room, creating a warm and toasty bedroom for me after taking a shower;)  For those who want to "really feel the heat" a microthermic-type heater would be a better choice (e.g. the direct heat produced by outdoor heat lamps at restaurants/cafes, etc.)  I haven't worried about it tipping over as it is very stable.  This is not a chrome heater as it appears in the photo, but a durable, metal-type substance similar to DVD players or stero systems.  If you are seeking a very stylish and retro-looking heater big into into design, this is the one.  This unit does not look cheap, and is affordably priced with a minimalistic design; even its on/off switch + HIGH/LOW switch (1500/700) and a knob for heat intensity (1-6) is just so simple--works for me.  4 1/2 stars only because the picture on amazon.com does not reflect how the unit looks in real life.

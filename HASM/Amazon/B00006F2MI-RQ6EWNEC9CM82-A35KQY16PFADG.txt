Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
Have had the coffee maker for a couple of months now and I love it.  I really like not having to use a separate grinder.  The thermal carafe is great - I have never had any trouble with it.  One reviewer mentioned it clogging up if you don't clean it each morning.  Not sure about this.  I prefer brewing coffee with clean equipment each morning so it has not been an issue for me.  Best of all, it makes great tasting coffee.  It is a little noisy when grinding the coffee but is definitely a keeper!!

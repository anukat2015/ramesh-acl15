In my quest for the perfect cup of coffee, I am very disappointed with this unit.  First, the coffee is warm, not hot.  The thermal carafe is a joke.  Coffee needs to be warmed in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Second, the filter basket is so small, that if you like robust coffee, you can only make 4-5 cups at a time.  No way can you brew 10 cups unless you like weak coffee.  My $15 Toast Master makes better coffee.  I'm returning the unit.

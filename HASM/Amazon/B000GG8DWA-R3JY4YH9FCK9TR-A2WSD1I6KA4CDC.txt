Title: Dead Quiet
Content:
I just received my new heater today and it's everything it's cracked up to be. It's dead silent and warms up the room quickly. I can bring it in any small to medium size room and it works great. I use it by my desk at 400 and it keeps me warm. Great product for the price.

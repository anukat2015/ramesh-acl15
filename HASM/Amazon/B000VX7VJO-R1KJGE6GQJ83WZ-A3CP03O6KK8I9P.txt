Title: THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!!!
Content:
OK...  I've tried them all.  Started with a $2000+ Seaco Super Automatic.  2 of those broke on me within the first 6 months.  On to a much cheaper Senseo.  Made so-so-coffee, but nothing to write home about.  With the Senseo I could never depend on a fool-proof cup.  Sometimes it was too watery and not at all hot.  Then I tried the more expensive Silver (look) Deluxe Senseo.  Pay more, get a better product, right?  NOT!  Even worse than the cheap-o Senseo.  
I spotted the Breville at Williams-Sonoma and was immediately drawn to its sleek good looks.  It would look beautiful in my new (all stainless) kitchen.  :-)  But I really didn't want to get into a K-Cup situation because it reminded me too much of the dreaded PODS from the Senseo.  
However, when I saw the Breville on eBay (New, Unopened Box) for $199.00 (a full $100 less than Retail stores!), I decided to take a leap of faith.  WOW!  Am I GLAD I did!  Perfect coffee every time and super hot - just as I like it.  I am one happy coffee-drinker!  Don't hesitate to try out this little beauty.  You'll be glad you did.  :-)

Title: Great Heater For Your Money!!!
Content:
After much research I decided to buy this little space heater for my cube at work.  I have to say on the low setting this thing really puts off some heat!  The noise isn't too loud, so I am still able to talk on conference calls etc.  In fact the noise sounds more like background noise which gives my cube neighbors and myself a little more privacy with our paper thin cube walls.  I like how the heater doesn't move back and forth on it's own.  You can decide how to angle it and it just sits there and heats.  Also, you can set the temperature you want it to kick on at using a series of buttons on the top.  It's a great buy for your money.
There was only 1 thing that I wasn't too happy with and it has nothing to do with the heater, so I'm not going to take a star away for it. The shipper, shipped the heater in it's own orignal box.  When it got here, there was a huge gash in the box probably because the box cardboard was so thin and I was concerned that my heater would be broken before I got it.  Whoever decides on the packaging for shipping, should really look into putting the heater with it's original box, into a crush proof box for actual shipping to ensure the heaters safe arrival.

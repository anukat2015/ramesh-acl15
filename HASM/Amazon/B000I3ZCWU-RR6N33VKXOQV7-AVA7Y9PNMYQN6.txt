Title: Best All Around Digital Camera
Content:
I did my homework, here it is. After comparing the Rebel XTI with the Powershot G7 I decided to buy the Rebel XTI becuase I wanted a camera, which had great reviews in terms of battery life, compactness, picture quality  and  durability. 
All in All the Rebel XTI is the best digital camera i've ever owned. It has all the above qualities to suit my novice camera needs, offering a professional image, except I will purchase the new Sigma 28mm-200mm lens featuring the optical stabilizer becuase its an all around lens--for close up shots and those farther away. At $899. for the camera and $550 for the Sigma lens this is not a poor man's camera. I saved for it. I figured the amount of money i'll save in film will pay for itself. 
Additionally, the G7 is not so bad. In comparance with the Rebel XTI (both Canon digital cameras) at $450 it features good battery life, a lens comparable with the 28mm-200mm all around lens, and a built in stabilizer. Its bulkier than the average digital camera but it picture quality parallels the Rebel XTI.

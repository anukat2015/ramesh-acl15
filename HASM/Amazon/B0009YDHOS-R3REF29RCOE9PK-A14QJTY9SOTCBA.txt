Title: Solid Machine and Well Worth Every Penny

******Update August 6 *******
THE REVIEWER THAT SAID THAT THE XP4000 IS DISCONTINUED IS A LIAR.  I JUST WENT TO THE KRUPS WEBSITE AND IT IS AVAILABLE. ALL THIS NEGATIVE REVIEW OF A GOOD PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN USING FOR NEARLY 2 MONTHS WITH NO PROBLEM AT ALL MAKES ME WONDER IF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWERS WORK FOR STARBUCKS OR A COMPETING ESPRESSO MAKER COMPANY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
It is a real pleasure to write a review for the Krups XP 4000 Espresso machine. My reason for buying this one is that I have become spoiled by the ease of use of my Keurig single serve coffee maker and wanted the same convenience of using pre-measured pods in an espresso machine. The XP 4000 allows you to use "E.S.E." or Easy Serving Espresso pods. It comes with the pod holder right in the package so there is nothing else to buy except the pods. The nice thing about ESE pods is that they are standardized; meaning that if the package of espresso pods has E.S.E. stamped on it you know it will work in your machine. This is something that single serving coffee machines have not been able to do. Of course you can also use your own custom ground espresso in the XP 4000 by using the included single and double cup filter baskets. I just happen to love the convenience of popping in a pod and tossing it away when finished with nothing to clean up. As for the machine itself the first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box is that it is very heavy and solidly built. The selector knob feels very solid and definitively locks into each position. I had been thinking about a low price Hamilton Beach model that accepts ESE pods but the reviews on it said that it was pretty flimsy so I am very glad I chose the Krups XP 4000. It was easy to set up and I filled the reservoir and ran the suggested two tanks of water through it to flush out the internals. Then I snapped the E.S.E. pod holder into the porta-filter handle and inserted a Starbucks espresso pod and was quickly brewing my first shot of espresso from my new machine. I must say that contrary to some reviews I read the espresso comes out quite hot; the perfect temperature I would say. The starbucks espresso tasted excellent slightly caramelly and bitter-sweet with plenty of Crema! I did do two simple things that I've learned from experience using single serve pod coffee makers. By following the pre-use flush instructions the machine and all components were quite pre-heated and I would always recommend running several ounces of water through the machine without espresso first to warm it up. Secondly when I put the pod in the holder, I poured a little water on it to wet the grounds. This does two things; it prepares the grounds to release their oils and flavor for a fuller bodied shot with lots of Crema and it also swells the pod slightly to ensure a tight fit in the holder and prevent water from leaking around the pod. This morning I did just that, ran a few ounces of water through to warm it up and this time I used Illy pods. It was a real treat. The shot looked like a freshly drawn glass of Guinness draft with all of the rich foamy Crema and was just superb! Some people have commented on the pump noise but having used my pump driven Keurig coffee maker and others for several years now I am used to hearing a pump run and the Krups pump is no louder than any of the others I have used. I didn't notice any appreciable vibration either. I haven't used the frothing function because I like my lattes over ice in the hot summer months but it looks well designed. I'll give it a try and add to my review at some point in the future. In conclusion, I am very pleased with this purchase and I am sure that you will be too. Even if you have $500.00 to $700.00 burning a hole in your pocket (as I sure didn't) I'm not sure you will get that much better of a machine. It is a real bargain at $148.00 and Amazon offers free shipping and a $25.00 discount as a promotion. 
*****UPDATE July 26, 2006******
Had to update my review. First of all the reviewer that said the machine leaks internally is wrong. The water reservoir outlet has an "O" ring seal that fits very tightly. I've used mine for over 2 weeks with not one drop of water inside the machine as they wrongly state. I would suggest to "gently" push the reservoir down until you feel the seal engaging. 
Also the machine makes just fine frothed milk. Go to the Krups website and view the videos on how to use the frothing attachment. I have never seen a Barista put a pitcher of milk under the nozzle before turning on the steam. Put an empty pitcher or glass under the nozzle after the light has gone out and turn on the steam. You WILL get some water initially. Steam condenses. Remember grade school science? Until the nozzle warms up to steam temperature the steam will condense. This only takes 3 seconds and you will get nice dry steam. Then put the pitcher under. I frothed milk to 140 degrees in under one minute. Also I think most people use way too much milk. Even with the double basket, a double shot of espresso is only supposed to be 4 ounces so you should only be trying to froth 4 to 6 ounces of milk at a time at the most. I personally prefer the taste of good espresso and routinely have to ask for my cappuccinno "very dry" when going out for a coffee drink. I think most places (starbucks especially) consider a cappuccinno to be a latte and a latte to be coffee flavored warm milk. Just my personal preferences. I stand by my first review. It's a solid machine for the money and a good buy. Also check out some of the ESE pods available. You can even get pure Kona or Jamaica Blue Mountain pods delivered right to your door. The fact that this is a reasonable priced ESE pod adaptable brewer makes it worth the price alone. Enjoy!

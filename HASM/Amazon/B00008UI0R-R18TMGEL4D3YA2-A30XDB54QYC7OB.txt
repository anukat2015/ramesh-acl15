Title: easy to use and powerful
Content:
The first canister I've used since my Mom's old electrolux 45 years ago.  Very powerful, easy to use. Love the retractable cord, show through dust container.  I have concrete floors and it picks up all the dog hair and dirt from outside.  It's ALMOST fun to vacuum

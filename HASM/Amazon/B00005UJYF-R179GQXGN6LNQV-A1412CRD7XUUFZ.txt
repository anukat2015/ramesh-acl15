Title: simple reliable, heavy, expandable device that runs XP just
Content:
siple, reliable, heavy device with big sharp screen....need to upgrade the paltry 128 megs of memory but it runs xp just fine as is... use it for reports at work and home but it has &quot;play potential&quot; with more memory..Just ordered a linksys wireless access point for my desk top and a card for the laptop so I can cruise the net while lying in bed with my spouse while she watches her murder mysteries... that should be a gas if I get it working and apparrently some folks find it a no-brainer while others run into frustrations. I tehd to have the latter but am tenacious enough to get it set up overr a weekend. If signal strength is good, the potential pf work play outside on a chaise lounge during warm months is worth the small price of admission for this used reconditioned system. The battery only lasts about 20 minutes now but I have an outdooe ground-fault outlet near an old gazebo that is live and safe. Cannot wait !

Title: Perfect addition to the kitchen.
Content:
Pros: Coffee Quality, ease of use, great choices in k-cups (coffee, tea, hot chocolate), many features (including brew temp), heats water quickly.
Cons: Noise is a bit loud, not terrible, but noticeable.  It is a bit large, but fit just fine where my old coffee maker sat.  
Great single cup coffee maker.  I purchased from a local warehouse store...contained some extra k-cups, including the "my k-cup".  I've tried about 5 different types so far, only one I didn't care for.  The others have been perfect.  Also tried a couple teas and hot coco, yummy stuff.  Also used this to fill my cast iron teapot with hot water, so easy.  I haven't tried the "my k-cup" yet, looks like it will work fine.
Only problem so far was hot chocolate getting cold, and setting up inside the release holes.  I went to brew some coffee the next morning, only one of the four holes were flowing.  The brew shut down, started blinking only on the large cup.  I took the k-cup out, put a large cup in, hit the large cup button, it did a water wash that took care of the problem.  Smart little device.  According to the manual, it also knows when to DeScale itself...and a message pops up, upon which you are supposed to process with vinegar.   
Also bought the carousel, perfect.Keurig 5060 27-Cup-Capacity K-Cup Spinning Carousel, Chrome

Title: nothing good about a broken vacuum
Content:
I confess that I originally bought it because it was cute and available at a store near my house.  Once home it seemed lightweight but strong.  The design made it a bit clumsy (tilting over when you moved) and the very first thing to break was the retractable cord...it got stuck and stayed put with a a 12" lead.  Fine, a month later and the thing has a permanent extension cord devoted to it.  Six months later and the bugger just won't turn on.  We live in one of these tiny NYC apartments so it's not like we've got excessive vacuuming needs.  Just one that works.  We went back to our little rechargeable Eureka Boss stick that's worked for years and rue the day when we've got to replace it.

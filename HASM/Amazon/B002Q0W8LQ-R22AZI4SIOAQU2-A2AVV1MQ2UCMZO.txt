Title: Amazing Price, Amazing Notebook
Content:
Great laptop great price, 7/10 build quality compared to Dell. the only bad thing is the preloaded windows & services  dosen't allow you to configure your windows in the way you like or partition your hard drive the way you like. (WINDOWS 7 IS AMAZING & SOLID) but if you're a basic user you will not have much truble. 
finally I would love to thank Amazon.com for their GREAT customer support. My first choice will always be Amazon.com

Title: What if you get a defective Heater ?
Content:
It's not a bad little heater but I had a problem with the front knob falling off.
I bought it from "heaterusa", through Amazon.com.
I have yet to receive any help from anyone, warranty or not.
Amazon.com could not help, the company? "heaterusa" seems totally non-existant.
I tried e-mailing them through Amazon, I tried to access them through the internet directly, I could not find a web site.
I assume Amazon.com checked them out before bringing them onboard.
I called the 800 number on the heater, I did get a recording that gave an international no., Tiwan ?  It didn't work either.
So...there's my two cents worth on this product.

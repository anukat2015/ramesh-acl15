Title: Worked fine for me..
Content:
From what I've heard of the reviews, guess I'm one of the lucky ones that received a functional product.
Bought the laptop 5 months ago, and havn't had any major problem with it so far.  the webcam however has compatibility issues, but once I installed a different webcam driver problem solved.
Overall, I do not regret buying this laptop, though I know there are better ones out there for the same price, I am particularly fond of the appearance of this laptop..

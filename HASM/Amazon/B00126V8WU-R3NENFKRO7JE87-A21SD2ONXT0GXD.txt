Title: Love it, but the earphones are already stripped
Content:
This has been a joy to have - it seems to keep it's charge longer than my husband's IPOD but it takes longer to charge.  I'm enjoying the music I downloaded from CD's we already had and downloading NPR's comedy programming.  I am disappointed in the fact that the earphone cable up near the plug is already stripped after just about a month, but we have some others around (with less good sound quality) so I'm still enjoying my Sansa.

Title: My Cleaning lady's choice
Content:
I don't know much or expect to learn much from vacuum, but I figured I'd pass my recent experience on...my cleaning lady had asked me to buy a canister vacuum so that she wouldn't have to lug hers up and down the stairs when she cleaned my place. She had told me to buy the Electrolux Oxygen, which in her opinion was great. After being turned off by the price and reading some of the reviews on-line for several hours, I decided to buy the Hoover WindTunnel Anniversary Edition. I told the cleaning lady that I didn't get vacuum she wanted, but that I saved $200 and that I hoped that it worked out. In a delightful twist, after getting to use the new vacuum, she just called me to tell me she loves the vacuum and if I could order her one of these vacuums. That's worth 5 stars in my opinion.

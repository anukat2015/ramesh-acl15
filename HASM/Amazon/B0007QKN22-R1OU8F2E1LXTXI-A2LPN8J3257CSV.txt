Title: Excellent camera at a bargain price!
Content:
I am new to the SLR world and have quite a bit to learn;however, I have to say that this camera is easy to operate and learn about from the booklet that comes with it.  I am very happy with the pictures I have taken so far.  I think that one of the best features is that you can take so many pictures, so quickly.  The macro feature has been fun also (taking close ups of flowers or of lemons on the tree).  I still have a lot to learn but this is the perfect intro to the SLR world I think and it won't cost you an arm and a leg to do so. The camera does not come with a memory card so you do have to buy that separately---Just know that so you can get that before your camera arrives.  Overall, excellent value!

Title: It's no I-Pod...
Content:
But it is still a good device. With 5 Gig for space you can fill this thing up! It's very sensitive when you get it so you may have to adjust the Touch Pad like I did.
*Pros
-Cheaper than an I-Pod and holds more (for the price, that is)
-Nice, modern look
-Add songs and delete them easily
-FM Radio (I don't use it so it's just extra)
-12 hours of playtime
-Displays song name, album title and singer name
-Has an alarm that automatically turns on device (I can't turn it off! [Not the device but the alarm!])
*Cons
-Way too sensitive on default Touch Pad settings
I own one of these but there isn't much else I can say about it. Oh yeah, it glows blue!!! Sweet!

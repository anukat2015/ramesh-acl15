Title: *Almost* Perfect
Content:
Works as advertised: quiet; produces heat. If it doesn't heat up the room fast enough, turn on the ceiling fan -- this works wonders (and you should do it anyway).
My only complaints are regarding the user interface: the thermostat and timer work, but the thermostat seems to set the heater to a *heat level*, rather than to a temperature, and the timer is not easy to override. I use the timer to turn the heater on from 4am-6pm, so that the bedroom warms up before I wake up at 6 and stays warm until the evening. If it's an especially cold day and I want the heater to stay on later, this is difficult to accomplish. I find it easier to use a separate, smaller heater for this purpose. For temperature, I use a digital thermometer that I had already to decide when to set the "heat level" on the thermostat.
If you want to avoid these things, you might consider one with a real programmable thermostat (with a digital display, I imagine).

Title: Doesn't work with Macs (and I'm an idiot)
Content:
I bought the Zune for my daughter for Christmas, she really wanted to have one.  After I got home and read the packaging it states that only Windows(tm) operating system can be used with the Zune.  Back to the store, get a refund, and finally bought an iPod.  Stupid Microsoft® and stupid me for not even thinking that Microsoft® would be stupid.

Title: great netbook
Content:
Started right up with no problems.  Brilliant screen with excellent resolution, easy to read, easy on the eyes. Battery life exceeds 6 hours. Very comfortable big key keyboard. Very good wireless Internet connectivity. 3 USB ports and chip reader provide versatility. In use about 6 weeks.
Combination of screen size, memory, disk size and processor speed with Windows 7 Home premium make this an excellent value.
Only complaint is terrible documentation both printed and online.

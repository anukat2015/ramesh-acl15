Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
The biggest reason I bought this camera was to save money in my conversion from 35mm to digital.  I use my two rebel x lenses and they work fine with the new camera.
The pictures are great, and I love it
I was leary of how long the delay was going to be, but there is virtually none, in fact I am taking pictures faster then my old rebel x.  
I am extrememly satisfied with this camera and would recommend for anyone to purchase it.

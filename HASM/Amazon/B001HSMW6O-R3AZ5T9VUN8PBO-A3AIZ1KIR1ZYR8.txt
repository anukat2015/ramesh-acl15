Title: Dealer 5 star Product 3 star.
Content:
Dealer fast and excellent service. Product much less than expected and extremely expensive. Black n Decker has lost their touch on this one. If you want coffee to stay warm for hours do not buy this one. It has a non heated insulated careff. holds heat for about 2 hours or less. Set timer and if you get up later than expected you get luke warm coffee. My old one was B&D and lasted 10 years. But with the warmer coffee stayed warm for 3 hours and with the flip of switch would heat another 3 hours. It was 12 cup and this is 8 cup. Not mentioned in ad. Guess quality and features are a thing of the past with B&D. Must admit though it is a slight bit prettier and slightly more compact.

Title: Finally, something that works!
Content:
This is about the 6th different kind of space heater I have purchased in the last two years, and is by far the best.  It takes the chill off our kid's (large - 15X20) bedroom that has no primary heat source.  After about 3 weeks of constant use, it has proven to be reliable, safe, quiet, and odor free.  I would definitely recommend it!

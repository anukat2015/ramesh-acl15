Title: 40D - First DSLR, couldn't be happier
Content:
I bought this kit nearly 4 months ago and couldn't be happier.
The learning curve was a little steep, being that this was my first DSLR, but once picking it up and shooting regularly and reading everything I could get my hands on, I feel pretty comfortable with it.
Interchangeable lenses is my favorite part about DSLRs. Moving from wide angle to zoom is easy and worth the hassle for the image quality you get from the canon 40d.
I originally purchased this camera for its burst capabilities for sports shooting and have since paired it with a 70-200 f/4 L. I am extremely happy with the results.

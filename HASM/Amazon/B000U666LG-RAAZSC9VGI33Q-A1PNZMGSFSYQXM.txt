Title: Honeywell HZ-7200 Cool Touch Oscillating Heater
Content:
It is currently heating a 20x30 room with adjacent kitchen and some of the heat is going up stairs to a bedroom. The room is usually about 70 deg. F and my nephew sits at his computer in his pajamas.
It replaced a $200 eBay EdenPure (EP) which almost caught fire. The EP had a broken fan, fried thermostat and bearing problem then it tried to commit suicide. The Honeywell sits on top of the EP. LOL. :-(
If the other EP dies I will get another Honeywell.

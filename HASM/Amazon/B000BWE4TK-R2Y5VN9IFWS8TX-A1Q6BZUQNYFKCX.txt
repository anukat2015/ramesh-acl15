Title: Spectacular
Content:
Spectaculer camera! I recently upgraded from a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 to the Nikon D50, and it was definitely worth the investment. Picture quality is simple wonderful. I chose the D50 over a KonicaMinolta and Canon models in large part because of the very low noise the camera produces even at high ISOs. Noise at high ISOs was a major issue with the Lumix I had previously. I also chose this over the Canon Digital Rebel XT because the Rebel is actually too small. The buttons get crammed and are easly pressed by mistake, and with a good lens (the kit lens for the Rebel isn't too spectacular) the balance of the camera is way off. Neither of these is an issue with the D50. The D50 is very quick to focus in automatic mode, controls are easy to use, shot to shot time is wonderful. Battery life, which often seems to be an issue with digital cameras, is not with the D50. My father has a Canon Digital Rebel, and claims that this camera (the D50) is nicer, and the built in flash especially impressed him. The only thing is that while the two included lenses are quite good, neither makes a good general purpose lens. The 18-55 mm is often too short, and the 55-200mm one is often too long, so you need to swap lenses a lot. That said, this being an SLR, I plan on picking up a third lens in the future that ranges from say 28 mm to 200 or 300 mm. 
Highly recommended camera!

Content:
I an not sure if i will use Amazon again as the ear phones for my ipod not not work and frankly I would not of said anything because I do not have the time....if i purchased from local store I could of returned and got new earphones.....but that's what I will do as I do no want to wait weeks for a return on a defective item.....i'm learnong now.  Bu the way the Ipod is fine and you should send me new earphones and I may consider to use your services again.

Title: Reconditioned units
Content:
I too received a reconditioned unit from Amazon and am sorely disappointed. So I can't comment on the quality of the item because I'm sending it back. (Had to give it something, so I gave it a 3.) I just wouldn't trust a heater, particularly one that burns propane, that had once been "defective." I've never had a problem with Amazon before. Why they are doing this without informing the purchaser is beyond me.
(So much for staying warm on my camping trip this weekend.)

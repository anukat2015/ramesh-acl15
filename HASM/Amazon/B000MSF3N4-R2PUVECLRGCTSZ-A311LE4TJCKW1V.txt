Title: Warms via radiance quickly, whole room not so much
Content:
Bought this to replace a Vornado forced hot air fan.  Warms instantly if your near it but doesn't warm the whole bathroom as well as the Vornado.  My wife prefers the Holmes Quartz better. Controls are good and temp settings.  Great for warming area where she sits and puts on makeup. Does most of its heating by radiant heat and not much by forced air.  If you need to heat the whole room go with the Vornado but if you need to heat yourself the Holmes is best.

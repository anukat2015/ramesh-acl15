Title: Poorly Served
Content:
Nikon d700 "new" (though I have my doubts) arrived with all its cutting edge technology, its bells and whistles, its superlative reviews. I charged up a battery and attached a brand new Nikor 24-120mm lens, inserted an 8gb flashcard, formatted same, enabled "liveview" mode, removed the lens cover turned on the camera pointed and...stared, open-mouthed, at a blank dark monitor...now I am a novice, I don't deny it, so I was sure that I had missed a switch, a button, a lever, a trigger, a step, a sequence, a cryptic gesture, a password or a mantra which all but the most hopelessly untutored DSLR users already know and perform automatically and without thinking. So I read the "Quick-Start" over and over, searching for the hidden nuance, hoping it would suddenly jump out in front of me and I'd shout, "Oh for Pete's sake, of course, you have to blow on the flash bulb and tighten the camera strap first before the monitor turns on. How dense can I be?" But I came to no such epiphany, and so I called the Nikon 800 number and I was told, "You have a bad camera, Joe," and though my name is not Joe, I thanked the man for the bad news. The camera is on its way, as we chat, to NV whence it came and I am left wondering what kind of shoddy quality control placed Nikon's name on that camera neatly packed in that box with all of its accessories and cables and operating manuals, for me, the unsuspecting and very disappointed would-be user to discover that oh, it doesn't work.Nikon D700 12.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)

Title: I do not like it, Sam I am!
Content:
I bought this 3 years ago to use on tile & terrazzo floors.  The floor attachment is badly designed so it suctions to the floor!  The hose is cheaply made & kinks often.  For even my low pile area rugs I have to scrub to get even the minimum trash up.  UGH!  I can't wait to replace it.

Title: Battery dies after 2 minutes of use
Content:
This vacuum worked wonderfully for the first week or so.  We always keep it on the charger so it's "ready" whenever the need arises.  Now, when I turn it on, the battery starts dying within 2 minutes of use, and of course there is no suction when this happens.  I have only used it approximately 10 times.  Also, there is no place to purchase new filters.  I had to do this online and pay a shipping fee.

Title: Ipod touch is AMAZING, but...
Content:
This is for the ipod touch Apple iPod touch 32 GB (2nd Generation), and for the yearly "update".
First of all the Pro's of the Apple iPod touch 2G vs the 1G.
2G, volume control, thinner, speakers, etc.
Cons:
Headphone button next to the ipod to US.
Overall, the iPod touch is fantastic. It has all of the apps and things you can need, "It's more of a pocket PDA than an MP3 Player." I now see this.
This is a great buy for people without any iPod, and highly recommended, or, if you have a very old ipod, this is what you should get.
But, be warned, this is WAY more advanced than a regular mp3 player. If you are just going to listen to music, get a shuffle, or a nano. This is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more than that.
If you have an older version of iPod touch,
I do NOT recommend this. I have heard rumors of an ipod 3G/ bluetooth/ 64GB (or something like that) to come out in a few months. I do not know if it's going to be that much different, or if it will be much better, or if it will just be a memory increase. What I do think is that once that comes out, the prices will be:
8GB Touch, $199 (or dropped)
16GB Touch, $229-$249
32GB Touch $299-$349
64GB Touch $399-$499
This is my GUESS. I do not know if this is true, or just a rumor.
All in All, this new iPod touch is better than the first generation, but not worth buying it if you have the 1G.
UPDATES FROM SEPT 9/ YEARLY UPDATE.
Ipod touch:
OK upgrades. Most i said above.
Ipod Shuffle:
None really, just colors.
Ipod Classic:
I don't think this changed at all for good. The 160GB Classic was dropped... and the 80GB became a 120GB, for the same price. Yes, that is good, but for the MAX memory that people want, this was a bad choice.
Ipod Nano:
HUGE Upgrade.
Accelerometer, new look, new everything really, this was good and bad. I actually prefer the 2nd generation look, although this 3G nano is pretty cool.
RUMORS:
64GB iPod Touch
3G iPod Touch
160-240GB classic
I haven't heard anything else.
Well thats my review.

Title: Just purchased this $231 at Sears
Content:
Everything written in the reviews is true.  I wanted to go back to a canister and was looking around at Sears and saw this model clearanced at $231.  I was a little nervous buying it because I had done zero research on the product.  I've used electrolux in the past and always liked it.  I've also used Kirby and Hoover uprights.  I am thrilled with the electrolux.   It's powerful, lightweight and maneuvers beautifully under beds, around corners and tight spots.  For the price I paid, I am beyond excited.

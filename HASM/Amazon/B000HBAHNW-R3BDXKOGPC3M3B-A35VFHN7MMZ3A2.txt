Title: Great vacuum
Content:
This vacuum has been great so far.  It is very quiet and although I did not consider noise level to be important, I wish that I had a Miele when my children were small (napping).  I use this along with a Roomba and my floors have never been cleaner.  DO NOT BUY AN ELECTROLUX.  I have always owned them but they sold their name to another company.  Sadly, I own two newer ones.  They are junk now and will be going into the trash.  I  cannot speak to the longevity of the Miele, but I can tell you it is very well made and it is the best vacuum for hardwood floors I have ever used.  I did not get the "turbo" brush so I do have to push a little harder when cleaning rugs, but it is gooD exercise!

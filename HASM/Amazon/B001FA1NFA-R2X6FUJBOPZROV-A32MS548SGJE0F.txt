Title: Apple iPod Nano 8GB Pink
Content:
I have a Apple iPod nano 8 GB Pink (4th Generation, and I love it.  I can put so many songs on it, and they all sound great!  Plus it is so easy to carry pictures around in this small Nano as opposed to a photo album. I can listen to Country, Easy Listening, and motivated music for walking fast!!  So Great!  Yes I would buy another, and I recommend to anyone looking for simular device!

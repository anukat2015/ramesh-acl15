Title: Poor Design
Content:
This is a heads up to Amazon customers interested in purchasing an Olympus E Volt 300.  It could be a great camera but it has a serious design flaw that should make you pause and consider the competition before buying.  The remote release (RM-CB 1) will not plug into the camera body.  You have to buy this HLD-3 "adapter" for almost $100 just to "adapt" the remote release to the camera body.  Couple that "surpise" with the $75 or so for the RM-CB 1 remote release and one is faced with $175+ just for a remote shutter release. What adds insult to injury is that the "adapter" is really "clunky" on top of that.  Check out what the competition has to offer before you purchase the Olympus E Volt 300.

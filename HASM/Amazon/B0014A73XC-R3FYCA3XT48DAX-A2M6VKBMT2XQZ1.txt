Title: Great if you buy a new laptop every year...
Content:
I admit up front I bought this laptop based on its looks. I was warned that HP have loads of weaknesses, but I was determined. I had an ASUS before which is still in use after 4 years. However, this laptop was just filled with problems from day one. First of all, the mouse pad: often the mouse just started wandering around and I could not control it for several minutes. The keys began sticking and breaking within 5-6 months. Lastly, and most seriously, the hinge broke and over time became worse and worse. I tried to fix it, but after that repair, soon after the whole screen snapped and the laptop was dead. Last time I buy an HP.

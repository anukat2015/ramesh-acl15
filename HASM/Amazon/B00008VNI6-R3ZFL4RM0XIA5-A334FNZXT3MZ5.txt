Title: Great Coffee Maker!
Content:
I have a talent for smashing coffee carafes, usually while I'm cleaning them.  I almost never made coffee for myself at home because I hated cleaning the carafe.  I researched (though my husband would say obsessed, and he may be right) carafe-less options and decided the Keurig would be a bad choice for us because of the pods.  Found this one, and had to consider that I have a low clearance between my countertop and upper cabinets -- only about 14 1/2 ".  This fits just fine, and makes great coffee.  Cleanup is a breeze.  The inside is a bit stained, but lemon juice should take care of that when it bothers me enough.  Also gave one to my parents for Christmas, and they have not had any problems.

Title: Do Not Purchase!
Content:
Yes it looks good. We bought one for our conference room in our office, thinking that clients would appreciate the nice-looking coffee machine.
Unfortunately, the machine is very poorly designed. After setting it up, we poured coffee into the grinder, and it ground away. And away. And away. You see, it doesn't stop automatically, or ever, apparently. So, we turned off the machine. Then you turn it BACK ON to actually make the coffee.
The manual states that if you want 'hot coffee' you should run hot water into the carafe for a while before you make coffee. This is idiotic... every time you make coffee you have to make two trips to the water supply, then turn the machine on and off TWICE.
To make matters worse, the insides of the machine get splattered with coffee grounds. This was after TWO USES. And, water condenses inside the coffee bean holder, which means the grinder is grinding wet beans, unless of course you clean and dry the insides between every pot of coffee.
Roasting my own beans and grinding them with a hand-operated mill and then making coffee in a French Press is easier.
Did I mention that the coffee didn't taste good? And I used just-roasted Peet's House Blend so it wasn't the fault of the beans.
Get something else. I suspect the positive reviews are written by Cuisinart employees.

Title: works great...
Content:
this heater works good.. you need to "break it in" first. it's best to do that outdoors..i think it took my heater about 6 hrs. maybe a little more. can't remember..i know it doesn't make sense to have a heater outdoors but if you do that inside you get burning metal, paint curing smell??,some of the shiny metal parts will change color. that is supposed to happen..
it was putting out so much heat it would make my ceiling fan twirl.. you must learn how to adjust flame and what the flame should look like. only buy the best kerosene available.. 
only smells are at start-up and shut down. once it gets up to operating temperature no smell at all. not even a little..
full tank does last 12 hrs.. not sure what happened to the other reviewer.
i would recommend this to buy.. but only if you would use it wisely..
the only reason i didn't give it all stars was the handle that all kerosene heaters have.. seems that they can be engineered better. the handle works but seems kinda flimsy..
i would buy another one but one is enough.. i had a hard time finding a kerosene heater and hurried up and grabbed this one when i found it at an ace hardware store..

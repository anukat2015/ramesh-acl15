Title: Defective On Switch???
Content:
Purchased this and used it for approx 2 weeks...  woke up one morning, tried to make coffee and I could not get the brewer to turn on.... tried another outlet and other appliance worked on the outlet I was using.   The brewer just stopped functioning...  the 2 weeks I used it I thought the product was "ok".. wasn't thrilled with it and decided to keep it anyway..then it broke.    The cup size was very small, the coffee filter that comes with the product is very flimsy...but I was going to try to live with  all that.    Trying a bit more expensive brewer...  glad it stopped working before my 30 days expired to return it.      The concept is great... just one cup at a time using your own coffee..I also own a Senseo - and wanted to switch to my own coffee for awhile to use up my supply before it goes stale.   Going to try the Cuisanart 4 cup brewer ... hopefully it will last me for years instead of weeks.   I would not recommend the above product to a friend.

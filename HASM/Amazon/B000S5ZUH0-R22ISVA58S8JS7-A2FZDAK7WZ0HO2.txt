Title: Archos 605 Wi-Fi 160GB
Content:
The Archos 605 Wi-Fi 160GB is a great personal media player, but there are a few design flaws that need to be addressed. I'm afraid that the design of the control buttons that are along the right side are fragile enough to be accidentally pulled loose under the right conditions, and to replace the battery, you need to send the unit in. The pullout stand on the back of the unit is a little weak, but works great. The interface is a little slow, and i'm still trying to figure out all the functions. The instruction manual is in 5 languages, but still doesn't give you all the information you need. However, the screen is awesome for both pics and video, and it hold my whole CD collection with lots of room to spare for video and pictures. The headphones sound great, but the exteral speaker is a little weak. Definately would recommend, but would probably save my money and get the 30GB if I had to do over again and if the price is right.

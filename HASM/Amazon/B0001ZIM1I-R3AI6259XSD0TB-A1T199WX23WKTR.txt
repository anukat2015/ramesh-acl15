Title: Commenting on what  A Home & Garden Enthusiast Said
Content:
Dear H&G Enthusiast,
I too was disapointed by the results that I obtained.  I used the PAC260 for almost 8 years, 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I got immediated relief when I turned it on.  I got 20-35 degrees of temperature relief and 20-45% humidity releif from this machine.  it to 20-30minutes to get this relief.  I never used the water in my PAC290 and got this kind of releif.  I was told that the PAC260 and the PAC290 as I used it were the same.  they clearly are not the same.  Another issue that you did not adress which I hope you will address if the air filter provided with the machine.  In my old PAC290 the filter would be caked with particles after a week.  This one is as clean as th eday I got th emachine installed several days ago.  Are you finding this to be the case, I would appreciate knowing your result.  It is a great machine, but does not quite live up to the PAC290 that I purchased in 1995.

We were disappointed to find out after purchasing this unit that it takes a long time to cool a room. It's not like a window unit that pumps out frigid air for quick relief. For the 150-square-foot office in our home, it takes 6-8 hours to lower the temperature from the 80s to the low 70s. But none of this machine's slow-cooling characteristics are mentioned in any of the materials.

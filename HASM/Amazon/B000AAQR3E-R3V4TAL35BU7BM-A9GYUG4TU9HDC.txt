Title: I like the old design better
Content:
Great suction power.  Tools are well designed with swivelling angles to the heads.  The manual turn dial is easy. Small and light.  The clip-on holder for the telescoping wand makes this easy to hoist around the house.  It is quiet.  The retractable cord is pure genius.  So is the HEPA filter.
Design-wise, I prefer the old Miele design better.  This S4 series has no bumpers around the edge, the accessory tools are not "on-board" (i.e. integrated into canister) but clips onto the telescoping wand which can get awkward.  I guess curvy designs are in, but I'm not a fan of the zeitgeisty bubbly designs.  The old boxy configuration is more my taste.
NOTE:  If you have high-pile, thick carpeting in the house consider purchasing a Miele with an electric hose.  This particular model is for tile, parquet floors and light carpeting - the hose attachment has no electric wire so the floor tools are not powered electrically.

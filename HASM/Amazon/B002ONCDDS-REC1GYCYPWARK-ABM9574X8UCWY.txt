Title: My computer doesn't work
Content:
I bought the computer in the internet, in amazon.com. It arrived yesterday, I turned it on and all I see is a message NO BOOTABLE DEVICE. INSERT BOOT DISK AND PRESS ANY KEY. I dont know what to do,it is written in the box that Windows 7 is already installed. There wasnt any cd in the box. The computer arrived perfectly but I cant start Windows because this message is always appearing. 
I sent an email to HP and they gave me a few solutions that didn't work and I still can't use my computer because the Windows 7 doesn't start. I am waiting for a solution from the store.

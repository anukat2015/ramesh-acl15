Title: super camera
Content:
I have a Digital Rebel XT that I love. I needed a second camera so I purchased the XTi, another great camera.
Beware ordering this camera from Adorama. I placed an online order with them for the XTi. After I placed the order I got a call from one of their sales people. He informed me of specials that were available with the purchase of the XTi. I agreed to one of the specials, but didn't receive everything I was told over the phone.

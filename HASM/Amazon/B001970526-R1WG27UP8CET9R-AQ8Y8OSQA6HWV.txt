Title: Like being stressed out?  Then buy this Dell craptop...
Content:
Highly unstable computer.  Dell's customer service reps are totally ignorant and lied to me over and over again about my warranty.  The reps all sounded like broken records.  Stuck with a lemon now after years of good products and service from Dell.  Dell Computer is not the high quality company it used to be and I'm betting it never will be again.  Look for this company to go bankrupt along with any company that doesn't understand that poor treatment of customers leads to poor sales and eventually bankrupcy.

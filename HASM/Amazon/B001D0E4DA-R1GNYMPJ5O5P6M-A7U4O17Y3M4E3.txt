Title: Doesn't work after Digital TV Transition in the U.S. on June 12, 2009.
Content:
I am very disappointed with Archos customer support. My Archos became unusable after Digital TV Transition in the U.S. on June 12, 2009. When attempted to record TV shows from Direct TV onto my Archos. The sound became staticky. I make sure I downloaded the latest firmware and still couldn't get it to work again. I called and email Archos customer support multiple times but their staffs are not knowledge about product. All the questions asked they have gave me incorrect answers. They are only good for taking your information if you have to file an RMA. In addition, don't expect the TV Guide that comes with your docking DVR adapter to work. Archos customer service told me it hasn't been working for the last 3 months because they can't afford a new server. 
This is a terrible experience; I wasted $400 for a piece of junk.

Title: Nice Little Heater
Content:
I've had mine for 3 years now and run it during the 4 coldest months of the year in my not-very-well-insulated bathroom. The heater raises the temperature about 10-15 degrees above the rest of the back of the house (from 55 in the bedroom to 65-70 in the bath).  For under 30 bucks this heater does a nice job, but it obviously won't replace a good heating system.  It also works well under a cool desk. As for the smell, if there are chemicals present in the area, the heater (like any electric element or gas heat source) will cause a nasty smell. A good way to see if you'll get a smell is to use a hair drier on the highest setting in the area you wish to heat and if you get a smell from that, you'll get a smell from the heater. This doesn't heat a cold room... it adds a little warmth to a cool room in a specific area, like to warm the toilet area in the bathroom on a cold morning. For the price... a good value! (especially if you're a sitter, not a stander!)

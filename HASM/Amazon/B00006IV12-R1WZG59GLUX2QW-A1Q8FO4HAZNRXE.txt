Title: Luck of the draw
Content:
We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead.
The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting. 
End result: Don't waste your money. There's no way of knowing if you'll get a dud.

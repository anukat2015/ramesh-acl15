Title: you get what you pay for...
Content:
Nice packaging, convenient canister design is very easy to use adn lightweight, BUT:1.  You have to empty the canister about every 10 minutes in order to maintain decent suction,2.  Emptying it is a pain, you get covered in dust and practically have to use your fingers to get debris out of the filter.We resold ours and opted for a Dyson instead, which cost almost 4 times as much but worked like a dream!

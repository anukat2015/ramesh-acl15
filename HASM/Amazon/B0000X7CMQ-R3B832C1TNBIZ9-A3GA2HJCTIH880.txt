Title: great coffee
Content:
This coffee maker gives me the best cup of coffee I have ever been able to make at home and does it quickly.  I have ground my beans and bought good coffee for years and finally enjoy the result.  It is easy to clean and use.  The carafe will keep the coffee reasonably hot/warm for up to three hours.  If I want to make that longer I put boiling water in the carafe for several minutes before I turn the maker on.  The only drawback (not for me) might be the height of the unit when the lid is up, 24 inches.  Down it easily fits under the upper cabinets in the kitchen.  I think you would have to spend a lot more money to get a coffee maker that would make a better cup of coffee.

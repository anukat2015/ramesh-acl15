Title: This sucks...BIGTIME
Content:
Easily the best vacuum we have owned!
Washable filter/dust cannister that makes it SO easy to get ready for 
the next cleaning adventure.
I bought this machine based on the reviews here and kept in mind that 
I could return the vac if I was not happy.No worries,I won't be returning it!
It just keeps on doing a very good job at picking up what went down.

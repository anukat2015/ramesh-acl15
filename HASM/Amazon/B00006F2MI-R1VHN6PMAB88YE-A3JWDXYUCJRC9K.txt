Title: makes 1950s coffee even from great beans
Content:
Anyone who grinds beans is going to want good coffee. This turns very good beans into something generic from a can. After one pot from this machine, we went out and bought a Capresso, the only combination with an adequate grinder even if it is a bit klugy.

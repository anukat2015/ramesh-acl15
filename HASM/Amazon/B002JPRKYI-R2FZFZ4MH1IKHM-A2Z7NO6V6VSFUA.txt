Title: Love This Little Heater
Content:
This is a great little heater if you don't need to heat huge spaces. At 10K BTU it is powerful enough to heat my 640 sq ft basement to 75 degrees even with a crack in the window and outside tempreture of 30 degrees. If you use a good quality Kerosene such as Crown 1-K or a reputable K-1 Clear suitable for use in unvented Kerosene heaters, you get virtually no odor from this heater. Adjust the flame correctly and it is a sweet burner for sure. I may use this one regularly to knock the chill off on those extra cold nights. I would recommend this heater.

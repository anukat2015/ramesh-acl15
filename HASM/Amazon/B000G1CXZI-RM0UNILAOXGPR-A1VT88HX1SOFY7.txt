Title: A good one, but get if outside of Am..on
Content:
Very good heater, I got two of those, the only drawback is that one of them is noisy - makes the click click sound when  stops heating. Otherwise - perfect. It helped to reduce drastically the exorbitant gas bills I was getting this winter.
No leaks, no smells. It works in enclosed spaces, don't expect miracles in open spaces.
Get with confidence, the real price should be around $50, but beware that A.....n manipulates with the price - they raised it from $50-ties to $80ties last winter.

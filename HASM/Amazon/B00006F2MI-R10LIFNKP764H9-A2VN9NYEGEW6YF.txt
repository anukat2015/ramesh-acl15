Title: Surprised by all the negative reviews!
Content:
I've been using this cuisinart for three years and I'm very surprised by all the negative reviews.  I've been really happy with it.  It grinds my beans, makes a good cup of coffee, and keeps my coffee hot.  Yes it does have some downsides:  you have to clean it with every use (would you really expect that you wouldn't?  Just stick the pieces in the dishwasher); you can't see how much coffee in the carafe (its thermal); the grind isn't perfect (a bur grinder does a better job but will cost much, much more); it pours slowly (a trade-off I don't mind because my coffee stays hot); you have to tilt it far to pour (again, I don't mind because I like the hot coffee).  The only time I've experienced the coffee explosion others have mentioned is when I have put the pieces in place incorrectly (usually when still half asleep).  But it is really not as complicated as other reviewers have made it sound - in three years I've made that mistake once or twice.  Overall it does its job well and I would buy it again.

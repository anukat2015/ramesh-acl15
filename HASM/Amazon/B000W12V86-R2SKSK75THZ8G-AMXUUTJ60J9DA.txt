Title: Works well but vista isnt as...
Content:
Overall this product performs descently. granted Vista isn't as good as Microsoft claims it to be and trying to downgrade to a earlier OS isnt easy for compatibility issues. But overall the graphics card and overall performance kick butt.  4 star rating by me...5 if Vista wasnt installed.

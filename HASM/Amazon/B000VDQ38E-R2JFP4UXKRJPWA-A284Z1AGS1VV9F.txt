Title: Far from satisfied
Content:
Vacuum indeed picked up mounds of dirt.  After using for about 20 minutes the color indicator showed I had a clog and the motor ran loud.  I took apart the entire unit to look for the clog, repeatedly.  I found no clog.  Cleaned filter.  Used vacuum a second time and brush stopped rotating and smoke was coming from the motor.  Ridiculous.  Cannot recommend this product.

Title: Great DSLR for beginner like myself
Content:
This is my first SLR and I love it, so many things to learn. This body is definitely a good starting point for beginners like myself before we upgrade to something higher (like 5D) while still continue to able to use our collection of lenses. Canon definitely has a good marketing strategy to strengthen its penetration for SLR camera line.
Pros: Good user-interface, affordable, light-weight, good for beginners, compatible with EF & EF-S lenses
Cons: Battery is relative weak, viewfinder is somewhat small

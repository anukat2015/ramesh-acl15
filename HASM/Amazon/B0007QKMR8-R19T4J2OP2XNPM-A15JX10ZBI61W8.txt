Title: yet another postive review
Content:
I already had so I was already predisposed to getting a Canon Digital camera.  I love my Elan but it's the digital age!  
The Digital Rebel works with all my Canon lenses without a problem.  It took a little time getting different to the behavior due to the size of the sensor versus the film but not too long.
The unit is well made and has stood up he test of time.
Color response is accurate enough for me.  It's clearly not film but I can live with it.

Title: works okay.... for small spaces
Content:
I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment and was hoping this would keep my 11 ft x 14.5 ft living room/kitchen warm on really cold days. I can't feel any heat at all unless I sit directly next to it. This only works in a small tight space like an office...or if you live in a closet. I used it in the bathroom and it worked fine. This product boasts "for larger heating capacity" for 144 sq. ft. My space is slightly larger than the recommended size but I still think this wouldn't work so well if my room was the correct size. I really expected this heater to keep the rooms cozy and toasty but I guess my expectations were too high. It only heats the room a couple degrees more, but on a bitter cold day this thing won't help.
I still tried it in my small bedroom and I could barely feel anything. I plan on returning it and investing in an electric stove/fireplace.
 
The timer on this though, is very convenient and can be set to turn on/off repeatedly at any hour of the day. So wherever you plan on using it you can set it so it starts warming the room before you go in like in the bathroom in the morning.

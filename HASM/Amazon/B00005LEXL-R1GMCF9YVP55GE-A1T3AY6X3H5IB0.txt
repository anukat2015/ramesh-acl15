Title: Good Accessory
Content:
I use this with a small propane heater to keep my boat cabin warm during winter fishing. I keep the tank outside for safety and use the hose to connect to the heater. Works great. I strongly recommend you use an in-line filter to keep any debris in the tank from clogging the heater. My first Mr. Buddy quit working after 1 1/2 seasons due to a clog. For the replacement unit, I have a filter installed (as recommended).

Title: Swamp Cooler
Content:
This thing actually saved my life.  Living in a city where they claim "air conditioning is not necessary", I almost lost it on that fluke week of 90 degrees!  The room does have a damp feel to it if you run with the cooler for a long time, but MUCH better than the alternative.  Also, with the cooler, (female talking here) my skin is 10X better due to it not being dry.  My new kitten and I thank Amazon for getting us through the HEAT, for a great purchase, great price and shipping RIGHT ON TIME AS USUAL!

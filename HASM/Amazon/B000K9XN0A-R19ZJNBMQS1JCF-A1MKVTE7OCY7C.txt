Title: Great hot coffee!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker because I was tired of transferring coffee into a thermal pumper after brewing with our old coffee maker.  In addition, our coffee never stayed hot for any period of time before.  But now, with the new Cuisinart thermal coffee maker, our coffee is hot for a very long time.  
I don't have the problems some of the other reviewers have mentioned, although I am very careful to click the basket closed and to maneuver the carafe lid to the proper position.  It is easy to use and brews great coffee quickly.  The "beep" at the end of the brewing cycle is nice, plus it turns itself off when it is done, too.  This is a great feature, I think.  It is easy to see how much water to put in, too.  There is a little thermometer-like window on the side that has a small red ball in it and it goes up to the level you want when you pour water in.  
We just love this coffee maker and I would recommend it to anyone.  We paid only $89 on sale, which I consider a bargain.  It is very tall, so if you have a small space for a coffee maker, you might want to measure before you buy.

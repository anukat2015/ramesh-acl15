Title: This vaccum looks great
Content:
I'd been looking for a light weight vaccum to pick up small messes and to do the car ect. For these projects it's great but if your looking to purchase a vaccum for everyday use on a carpet then buy something better like an up-right. The attachment for carpets on this vaccum is cheaply made and is not going to hold up to everyday use.

Title: Two design issues
Content:
Okay, well it brews a decent cup of coffee, and it's fast enough.  The carafe and hinged lid are about the worst design I've seen. You can't pour out the last half cup of coffee without spilling it.  The programmable feature is nice, but there is no locking mechanism on the clock's buttons, so with the slightest bump (or wipe with a cleaning cloth) you will accidentally change the time.  Of course the time only adjusts in one direction so when you do accidentally change the time by one hour, you then have to hold the button as it runs through the remaining 23 hours to get back to the right time.  Not very well thought out.
UPDATE: January, 2009 - The lid hinge is now broken so the lid falls off when pouring unless I hold it on with the other hand.  What a cheap piece of crap.
UPDATE: February, 2009 - UGH!  The handle completely came off the carafe in my hand mid-pour.  Unbelievable.  The thing completely fell apart in 6 short months, and I have massive coffee spill to clean before I've even had my first cup. Starbuck's, I need you!

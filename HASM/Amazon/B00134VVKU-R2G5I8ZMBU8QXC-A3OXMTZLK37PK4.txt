Title: Good basic player
Content:
Good: 
- cheap
- excellent sound quality (for my untrained ear, at least)
- plays by folder, simple drag-and-drop interface. Just drag the folder with MP3s onto the player and the folder's name will be listed in the player's menu
- ability to delete files on the player itself
- FM radio
- pretty small
- AAA battery source - no need for a charger
- standard USB connector
- standard male-female USB extender cable included 
- serves as a USB thumb drive
Bad:
- in a folder mode in order to switch to a diffrent folder you have to    scroll through all files one by one to go to the top, you can not just jump to the top in one keystroke. So do not put a lot of music files in one folder.
- cheap plastic body
- no silicone case available
- removable cap will in all probability be lost
- only 8 hours battery life, so rechargeable AAA batteries might need to be used
- only 4GB and no extension memory slot
- headphones probably would not satisfy most users
- tuner is not the best
- COBY products do not have a bullet-proof reliability record
Can not provide any info on tag IDs, I-Tune compatibility. etc. Specifically was looking for a player without all this nonsense, just with simple drag-and-drop interface. This is one of very few. I do not think you can find a cheaper 4GB player with all these features. Price is so low so it makes it almost disposable. Loss would not put an owner in the poor house.

Title: very nice, smells a little funny
Content:
Got mine from woot for 25 bucks, brand new (not reconditioned). I really like this thing under my desk. Wish the hi-low-fan switch weren't on top where your foot can knock it from where you want it set. Smells funny but that's just the new plastic; that will probably go away. I wouldn't want to pay more than $35.

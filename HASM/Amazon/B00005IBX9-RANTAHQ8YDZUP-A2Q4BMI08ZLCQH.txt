Title: Good overall
Content:
I like this coffee pot. The only thing is I wish it was not so tall. It fits under my cabinet, but when I have to fill it with water and the coffee grinds, I have to pull it way out so the top that opens, doesn't hit the top of the cabinet. But it does make good coffee.

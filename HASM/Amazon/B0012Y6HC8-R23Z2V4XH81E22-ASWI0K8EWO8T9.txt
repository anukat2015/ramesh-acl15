Title: Camera good - software bad
Content:
My wife has used a Canon SLR for a number of years, so a Canon EOS was the logical choice when purchasing a digital camera as it uses the same lens.
The Camera takes excellent photos and operates very similarly to the film model, only better in many ways.
I would have rated it five stars, but...
So far, it's been impossible to transfer images from the camera to the computer.  We managed to transfer one, but that was it.  Other images simply will not transfer.  The software doesn't recognize, and refuses to connect to, the camera.  Even after reloading the software and trying on a different computer.  The Canon help line was absolutely no help! NONE!!!  They insist it must be a "computer problem" as "no one else has ever had this problem".
Consequently, we must take the memory card to the in-store developer-kiosk and transfer images there, which requires two trips.
The camera is great and does everything she wanted, but the software and the Canon help desk are worthless!

Title: Doesn't seem to have a strong output
Content:
Well, there is a reason I am here on Amazon.com shopping for a heater for my dad.  And that is because he currently has this one.
Before I trash the heater entirely, however, let me say that the room we are trying to heat was once a single-car garage.  It has been converted (complete with fireplace (which he can't use since he is on oxygen)) but I don't think people who converted it did much in the way of insulation.  It FEELS like a converted garage a lot of the time.  So maybe it would be difficult for ANY heater to heat this room properly.
BUT.... it still doesn't seem to do what it claims.
We have tried to use the 360 degree feature, and only feel a bit of a change with the warm air being felt ABOVE the unit -- rather than in front.
When it is on front-heating, I have placed my hand in front of it trying to feel the hot air blowing.
I CAN feel hot air coming out -- but it just isn't coming out strong enough to make a difference unless you are a foot away from it.
When the temperature was about 40 or 50 outside, and he was using it just to take the chill out of the room, it worked fine.
He even had to turn it off at times because the room got too warm.
However, once the outside temperature truly became winter-like, going below 30 (and currently in the teens) the unit isn't doing the job at all.
It doesn't even warm the room if left on all night.
It just isn't powerful enough.
So, to nutshell this:  If you just need something to take the edge off a room, this might work well.
If you need something to actually HEAT your room under cold conditions, it can't handle it.

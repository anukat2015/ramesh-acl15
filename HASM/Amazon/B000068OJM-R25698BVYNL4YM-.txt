Title: Finally, the search is over
Content:
I spend a year compiling info on mp3 hard drive players.  Magazines, cnet, reviews......ect.  I have had the Nomad for 2 weeks now.  I can happy say it was a good choice.  The software is easy, especially when it comes to rip cds.  I am still playing with the many options.  So far nothing to complain about.

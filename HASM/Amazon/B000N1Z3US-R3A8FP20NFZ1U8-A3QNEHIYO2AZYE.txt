Title: I love the Black & Decker thermal coffee makers
Content:
For years I have used a Black & Decker thermal coffee maker.  The coffee stays fresh and warm for hours. Plus I can sneak a cup while it is still brewing. I am still using my old B & D themal coffee maker which is better made than this one, but I have certainly gotten my monies worth and I am sure I will with this one when I am ready to use it. My son loves this coffee maker,so I recently brought him the stainess steel 10 cup Black & Decker thermal coffee maker for his office.

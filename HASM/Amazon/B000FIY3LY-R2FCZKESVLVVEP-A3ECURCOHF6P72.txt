Title: An Odd Duck
Content:
Overall, I've been pleased with the performance of my Amcor unit. It cools and heats as advertised. I've used it for about three weeks now, and so far I haven't had any of the problems reported by some of the other reviewers. I use a ceiling fan, in addition, to distribute the cool air more evenly, and I recommend the procedure unless you want only spot-cooling.
While the unit performs its essential functions of heating and cooling very well, there are some serious physical constraints that might affect your decision to select this unit. First and possibly foremost, is the location of the hot air exhaust tube: Rather than exiting form the side, it exits from the back of the unit, so its back cannot be placed any closer than about six inches from a wall. The six inch diameter exhaust tube is six feet long, so the unit must be less than six feet from a window - probably closer to four feet, if your window sill is a typical three feet from the floor. The right side of the unit is the air intake side, which needs some clearance for the unit to work properly. The air outlet vent, which is on top of the unit, can be adjusted through a 90 degree range from straight up to straight out to the front, but it does not adjust horizontally. And, of course, an electrical outlet is required. There is a six foot electrical cord on the unit. In summary, you need a window, a near-by electrical outlet, and enough space to accommodate the unit's stringent positioning requirements.
The unit is on wheels and thus can be moved, but considering its weight and the foregoing constraints, it's not a likely choice if you want to take it with you from room to room on a regular basis.

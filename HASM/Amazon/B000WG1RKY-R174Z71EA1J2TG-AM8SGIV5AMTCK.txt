Title: Best MP3 Player all around
Content:
I Bought a zune 8 gb recently , and I must say im impressed , not only by the product itself but by the social thing that is a killer feature, The Product itself is a good,lean,and light Mp3 Player with the right functions to be included in any mp3 Player of this category: WIFI,Radio,Video,Images etc. Plus customizable backgrounds and games.
Zune Software totally better than Itunes and more appealing to be used and navigated. 
I Only found 2 points down on the zune thing
1.- Marketplace only for US residents; Me as a Mexican citizen found the marketplace a little bit tricky to be accesed from my country but I manage to do it, I think if Marketplace would be expanded to Mexico  would be great apart than Mexico offers a large market for any kind of brand.
2.- Limited Accesories; I wanted to buy inmediatly good sound docks for my Zune , but I found them very limited and very few of them. I think with the time the zune will become more popular and become even more "accesorizable" lets say :).

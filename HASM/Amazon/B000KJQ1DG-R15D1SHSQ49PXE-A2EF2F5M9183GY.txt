Title: Great beginner DSLR
Content:
The D40 body and kit lens offer exceptional value for beginers and more experienced photographers transitioning to digital(me). If you have a closet full of old Nikon lenses you want to use, best to move up to a more expensive body that allows them to autofocus. The newer AF-S lenses used on the D40 focus very fast and they are lighter weight than previous series. They will also work on the higher end bodies if you decide to upgrade later. I bought the 18-200 zoom and couldn't be happier with this combo. The included lens also works great. Order the cheap ML-L3 wireless remote and a 52mm UV filter for lens protection.

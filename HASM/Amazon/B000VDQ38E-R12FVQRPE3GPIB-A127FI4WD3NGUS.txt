Title: This is the best Vacuum for many reasons
Content:
This Bissell 3920 is simply the best Vacuum device I have ever owned. Its a huge upgrade from whatever I had before. Powerful cleaning power you can see as you reach for pet hair everywhere around the house. The hose is long enough and extends even more with all the neat accessories included in this set. You will use them all with ease and since its weight distribution is brilliant you will be less tired then when you cleaned with your old vacuum. The first time you use it you will be amazed at how much cleaner the carpet is and if you prepare the house for deep cleaning you can use this Bissell to pick up everything you see. Felt like you are doing a Television Ad for them in your home since this is all around the most exceptional vacuum you owned.

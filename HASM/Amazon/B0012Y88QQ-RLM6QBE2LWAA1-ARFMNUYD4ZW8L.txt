Title: Our First DSLR
Content:
I purchased this camera for my wife who like to take pictures of her garden plants and the dishes she cooks up.  She used to take them with an older 3.2 MP point & shoot camera.  Being that most of her picture taking needs were of close up macro shots, the old camera just wasn't cutting it and gave her a lot of blurry and washed out pictures.  
She is a small person so I wanted to find a light and compact beginners level DSLR.  I researched review sites and liked what I read about the Canon Rebel XSi.  It met all of the criteria and the price was very reasonable.  I purchased an extra macro lens for her.
We've had the camera for about a year now and we've taken thousands for photos and they all look amazing.  I never thought I would get used to carrying around a DSLR but now I can't go anywhere without it.  The pictures you get with this camera just don't compare to pictures taken with a point & shoot camera.  This is a great camera for those who are interested in getting into SLR cameras.

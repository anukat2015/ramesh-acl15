Title: Great for the Price!
Content:
We bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and it is still working great!  Highly recommend it!  Great price and great coffee!  My husband used to work at Starbucks back in the day as a college student and has no complaints about this coffee maker.  He makes the best + only problem is that it is not as fast as the professional $1000.00 ones.  Must buy!  :)

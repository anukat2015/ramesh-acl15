Title: Great pc
Content:
Hp is always sleek, great desigs and the standard that we will all be pleased with. i have the hp pavillion 6707 entertainment pc a 15.6" and i wanted something a little bigger and i got this 17.3" hp pavillion DV7-3060US laptop. Firstly it looks amazing, the layout of the pc is quite nice. the pc runs and works really well. So far i have no complaints so i recommend this pc for anyone who is on their pc as long and often as i am watching movies, downloading apps, movies, software, doing work projects, playing games, and just having fun.

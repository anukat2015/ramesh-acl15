I bought this camera during Christmas for my wife.  She wanted a camera to get into photography as a hobby. So far she has absolutely loved this camera.  It has been easy to operate and takes great pictures.  There is also something about holding this style of camera in your hands that makes one feel hip and cool. Buy it, you'll enjoy it!

This laptop is probably too big for much carrying around, but if you are like me and just want a laptop for home use and occasionaly travel, this is a great deal.  It is great for watching videos.
I also like the windows 7 that this has, although some of the windows features take some getting use to.
The key board is really great, numberical key pad plus the key stroke is light.  The speakers are not as loud as I would like, but have ordered a separate speaker system for $12 so that really is not a problem. I have had this for less than a week, but so far I really like it, much nicer than my old compaq that was stolen.

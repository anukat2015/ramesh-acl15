Title: Great pictures but disappointed in the live view mode
Content:
I use my camera for taking pictures of our one year old mostly.  It is a great camera for small children because it can take a picture so fast you don't miss out on a good smile.  I am disappionted in the live view mode.  It is very hard to use and you can not use it in the auto modes.  They don't tell you that up front.  If you want to take pictures mostly with your LCD screen in live mode this is not the camera for you.  If you enjoy using the view finder this is a great camera for the price.

Title: Not durable
Content:
Carafe resting plate and plate underneath unit are already grossly corroded and rusted in just six months.
Clean light will not go off even after multiple decalcification cleanings. I have to unplug the unit and let the stored memory die before it will go to normal.
water reservoir is awkward to fill, especally near full capacity.
Coffee is OK, nothing special.
 I'm sorry I bought it.

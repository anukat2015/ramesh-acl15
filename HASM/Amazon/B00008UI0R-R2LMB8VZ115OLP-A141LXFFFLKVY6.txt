Title: happy
Content:
I use this vacuum only on my wood floors and am very happy with how it cleans. I haven't tried it on carpet.  I use the telescope attachment and pull the cannister along behind me. I LOVE the auto-retracting cord. This is a brilliant feature that I would never live without again.  The only improvement I would make would be if the cannister were light weight enough to carry around with a shoulder strap. I had an orek like this but it had bags which I detest. The bagless feature is wonderful. It's easy to empty and I don't ever have to worry about running out of bags or paying alot of money to buy them. This vacuum is great for getting all kinds of spots without changing attachments. I can vacuum the floor, window sills, ceilings, stairs, seat cushions without stopping. The suction is good. I would recommend it highly for non-carpet floors. I have no experience using it on carpet floors but it may be great there also.

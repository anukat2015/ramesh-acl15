Title: Exceptional coffee from a not so exceptional coffee maker
Content:
I will give this coffee maker 5 stars only because the coffee it makes is absolutely exceptional!  This is, without a doubt, the best coffee I ever had.  It has a deep aroma and taste and it comes out fast.  
However, I will give the built of the item a 1 star rating because it is very flimsy and cheap!  I am actually very disappointed by the fact that the water tank is not fully covered by the lid and dust has plenty of room to get in.  The filter cover bends in your hands as you wash it.  The thermal carafe is OK but its lid leaves a lot to be desired.
If I did not read so many excellent reviews and if Cook's Illustrated did not give it such high ranking, I would have returned it without even trying it.

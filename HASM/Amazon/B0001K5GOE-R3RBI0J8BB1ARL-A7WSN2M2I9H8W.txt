Title: Awesome, simply awesome
Content:
Forget the negative reviews. This vacuum is awesome. I had debated getting the cannister vs the upright after reading some of the reviews. I wondered whether it had the power of the upright. Maybe suction had been sacrificed to design and small size. The answer is no. I came in with somewhat lowered expectations, after all how great caould these vacuums really be. A vacuum is a vacuum.  Well I was stunned what this vacuum picked up of a Persian carpet in 5 or 6 test sweeps. Incredible!
The upright may be better for wall to wall carpetting but for my purposes this is the vacuum.  It's light compact and powerful and beautiful.

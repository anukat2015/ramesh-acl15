Title: LEAKS ALL OVER
Content:
I am in the market AGAIN for a new coffee maker, this is my 4th in the last 2 years, this one did great for the first 3 months, now it leaks all over the counter for no apparent reason. 
The space for adding water is TINY ! ! ! 
I make sure and put exactly 12 cups of water in machine, 3 end up all over my counters at 6 am and the rest is in the pot of not overly hot coffee. 
Would NOT recommend this maker to anyone, EVER.

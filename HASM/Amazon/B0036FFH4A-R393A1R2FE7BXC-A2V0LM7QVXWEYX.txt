Title: Good Price. Seems good so far
Content:
The item was in good condition. It came in a timely manner. It looks great and so far everything is good. My only concern is that i don't know how to tell if it's actually an i5 Processor. It says i3 everywhere and i guess we just need to trust the story that it was a mistaken i5 processor.

Title: Canon 40D.  An awesome camera
Content:
I spent a fair amount of time in research before purchasing this camera.  Before buying the 40D, I was the owner of a Canon XTi.  I had already purchased the 24-105 USM Zoom lens (an awesome all purpose lens) so I knew I wanted to stick with Canon.  Besides I am a skydiver and all the videographers/aerial photographers at my dropzone rave about the durability and quality of photos of Canon.  I was initially thinking about buying the XSi--I was attracted to the 12.2 MP.  But when I started looking into it more I came to realize that unless I was printing a photo larger than 9X12 I wouldn't ever really need the 12 MP.  Plus those images take up a LOT more storage space--and it seemed like the overhead requirements were beyond what I needed/wanted.
What I did find though was that a number of the improvements in the XSi were already in the 40D --and then some.  You can do your own research, but after looking at the specifications of the 40D vs the XSi, there really wasn't a contest about which camera I was going to go with.  This is twice the camera of my XTi --and although it is larger and a bit heavier due to the metal (not plastic) body, I can still easily fit into the back-sling camera bag I was already using for the XTi---and it is no problem to carry.
I like this camera very much and I am very happy with my purchase!

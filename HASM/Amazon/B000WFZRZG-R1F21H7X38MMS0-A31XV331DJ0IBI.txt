Title: Great Features POOR POOR Quality and Warranty, Even Worse Customer Service
Content:
Do Not Buy This Product!!!
As simple as it is the product does not hold up. It malfunctions randomly and Microsoft will not uphold their warranties when they do fall apart. Have had both programming and functionality problems. I have owned this product for 9 months. Have had 3 malfunction personally the 1 that I bought my fater for Christmas last year. Their customer service consists of 1/2 an hour of recorded messages that you have to listen to before you get some idiot that barely speaks english to try and tell you that they won't help you with the P.O.S. that their service center sent you. 
AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!! Unless you want a fancy paperweight.

Title: Don't know what the problem is.
Content:
When I got the camera it seemed to be working fine.  Not long after I had it I would take the picture review it, but then when I would go to put it on the computer there were no pictures in the camera.  I bought this as reconditioned and I'm wondering if this has something to do with it.  I will now have to take it in and find out what's wrong with the camera.  I paid, I think, a lot of money for the reconditioned camera, but considering of not buying another reconditioned one.  I will buy closer to home so that if a problem arises I will go back where I bought it.  Thank you for my opinion.

Title: Works for me!
Content:
I love this unit.  In fact I have 2 of them.  I have one upstairs in the bedroom area and it cools the entire floor, (with a little help from small fans to push the cool air around).  I have another in my 25x20 family room and it works GREAT there.  Keeps the temp down nice and cool, even on the hottest summer days.  
I live in Colorado and we are dry enough that cool air stays cool without the humidity to drag the temp back up.  Also, because we have low humidity the catch bucket takes several hours to fill and so the occasional empty is no problem.  Your mileage may vary in many of the more humid southern or coastal states.

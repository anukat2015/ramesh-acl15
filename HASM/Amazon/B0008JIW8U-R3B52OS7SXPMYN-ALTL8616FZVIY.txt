Content:
I agree with a lot of the reviewers here--this coffee maker is perfect for one or two people, and the delayed brew function is just terrific. It gets the job done in a no-frills sort of way. You can't go wrong for the price. However, when you compare this coffee maker to other more high-end models, you might realize that this one is just mediocre. 
I too have noticed that the clock starts to lose time after awhile, but besides that, I found it very difficult to find a replacement carafe for this model after mine chipped. Just to clarify, the lip of the carafe chipped just a tiny bit due to my own carelessness while washing it. Nonetheless, I found it impossible to locate a replacement at any retail stores, as most sold only larger-sized coffee carafes. I could order a 4-cup replacement carafe directly from Mr. Coffee, but once I factored in shipping and handling, it made just about as much sense to buy a new coffee maker.
Although I encountered this difficulty and I feel that this coffee maker isn't anything to write home about, I'd still buy it again if I needed a gift or wanted to make small amounts of coffee at a time.

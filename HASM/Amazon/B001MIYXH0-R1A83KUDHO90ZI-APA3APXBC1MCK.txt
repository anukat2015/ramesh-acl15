Title: Works well but some temp fluctuation
Content:
I bought this heater about three years ago and it still works well. I don't find the fan to be loud.  Although I can hear it, it doesn't interfere with watching TV etc.  A year or two ago I measured the temp setting against a thermometer and it didn't match up.  That's not a big deal though since you can learn what "temperature" setting is right for you.  When using the temp setting it does go about two degrees above the setting before it shuts off, then once the temp comes down to the set level it starts up again.  It does get a bit hotter than I like in the room before it shuts off so I have to deal with some temperature fluctuation.  Overall my 14' x 12' bedroom heats up quickly with this heater.

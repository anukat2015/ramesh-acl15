Title: Acer Reliability & Effecient.

Fast, Effective and Efficient buy for Laptop $$$
Overall very pleased with this machine. The larger 17.3" Screen provides ample viewing space for multiple windows. Not to mention that the HD color is impressive upgrade from the traditional LCD screens.  The true color registration is very useful for artist and graphic use.  The AMD Athlon II x2 processors (2.0GHz) and ATI combination is very effective and runs cool n quiet for size. The dedicated ATI Radeon graphics card works great and seamlessly for large video demos and graphics needs. It supports Adobe Photo shop quickly & seamlessly. The track pad can be a bit hypersensitive but affords the abbility to go back or toggle easily between windows once you have practice. You get the nice touch of disabling it for typing mode or curious little fingers. 
So I have had my machine for a little over week now. It is my second Acer.  My first one has been running for 5yrs (still going) but no longer had the dedicated memory capacity for my graphics needs.

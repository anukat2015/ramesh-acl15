Title: Takes great pictures if you learn how to use it
Content:
I have owned this camera (Olympus E-420) for over a year now and have been very pleased with its performance.
The picture and color quality is FANTASTIC and digital noise is very very low in conditions with low light, so long as I stick to the 'low key' constrast setting.
I share the same complaint of the user giving this camera 1 star...the autofocus fails to focus at times if I'm shooting in a dark setting. I work around this problem by keeping the camera on a single point autofocus setting and - gasp - just pointing the camera at the thing I want to focus on. In other words, the multipoint autofocus is slow but not usually necessary, especially if you're used to using an SLR.

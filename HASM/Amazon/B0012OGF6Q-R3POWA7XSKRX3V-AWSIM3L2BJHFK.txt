Title: Great camera!
Content:
I have got this package from Amazon about 3 weeks ago and it is amazing! The shipping is really fast and the camera takes beautiful pictures. I like the VR lens and I can take very clear still pictures of a show when the light is very dim even without flash. I used this camera to catch hummingbird's moves and I can even see the eyes of the hummingbird in the picture even when I used medium size and normal resolution setting. The only thing about the 18-55mm lens is that it's zoom is less powerful than I expected. I think I will buy a 55-200mm lens to take outdoor pictures. But if you mostly take indoor or party pictures, it should be fine. But I want a longer lens to use for wildlife pictures.

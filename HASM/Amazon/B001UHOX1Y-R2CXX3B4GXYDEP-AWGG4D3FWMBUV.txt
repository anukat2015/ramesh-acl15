Title: Very well thought out Ultraportable from HP
Content:
I believe that this laptop will provide some of you with exactly what you want, not a netbook with a 10" screen, but not a heavy laptop with a 15" screen.
This is in between.
Honestly, I love the laptop, I set mine up to dual boot the Windows Vista, and I installed Windows 7 on the other drive partition.  Thankfully, 320GB is plenty of hard drive for two operating systems.
The HP Entertainment PC software features make it very easy for anyone to stream TV, radio, and etc. without a degree in it!!!
The only flaw = I do not like the keyboard.  I do not like the shape of the keys (curvature), I do not like the color (all black and the letters are very hard to read in low light conditions), and I do not like the finish of the keyboard (too slick).
Other than that, it does run hot, but what high performing laptop doesn't???  My first tablet was a Fujitsu Lifebook T4020D, and its Pentium M 2.0 Ghz cpu would actually burn your skin if you let it.

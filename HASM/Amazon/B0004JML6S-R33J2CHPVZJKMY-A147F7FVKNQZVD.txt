Title: Very unhappy
Content:
Bought this coffee maker in black less than a year ago.  Did some research - seemed like the right coffee maker at the right price.  I really wanted one like my old Mr Coffee with the removable water reservoir, but settled for this one when I couldn't find that.  Within a few months, the hot plate at the bottom of the coffee pot started peeling.  Not just a little bit - there is very little paint left and it is starting to rust.  I will be replacing this soon - and definitely not with another Krups!

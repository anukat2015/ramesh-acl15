Title: The absolute best coffmmaker there is.
Content:
If you like fresh coffee, and if you like hot coffee, this is the coffeemaker for you.  I get up at 3:45 AM.  My wife gets up at 7:00.   I have the DCC-2000 set to brew at 3:30.  I have a couple of cups and go to work.  She's up at 7:00, and the coffee is still hot and fresh.  After a cup or two, she puts the rest in a travel mug and she's off.   We both like really good coffee and this does a great job for us.  The design of the DCC-2000 is about perfect.  You can clean it in a snap.  All the parts touching the coffee come out easily.  You can use the gold mesh filter or paper ones.  But the most important thing is the taste.   If you spend money on good coffee to start with,  this Cuisinart will become the one and only way you'll brew it.

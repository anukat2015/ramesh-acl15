Title: All around great heater.
Content:
I purchased two of these heaters this winter.  They have worked great.  They may not be 100% silent, but they are about as quiet as you can get for a space heater with a fan.  I use one on the low setting in my two stall detached garage to keep it at about 45 degrees.  I use the other in a 21' x 11' room in the house.  It easily and quickly warms this room.  I only have a couple of little complaints.  The oscillating feature is nice for heat distribution, but the arc range that it sweeps could be greater.  Also, it doesn't have tip over safety protection.  It only has overheat protection.  These cons are not enough to drop it from 5 to 4 stars, though.
I have tried a couple of different space heaters over the years.  I had some digital resistive element Vornados.  They heated the room and moved the air nice, but they all just up and died.  Too bad too, because they were not cheap.  I had a digital Holmes that worked like and had all the same features as the Vornados, but it too died.  I have a Pelonis Safe-T ceramic heater.  It still functions and puts out good heat, but it is pretty loud.  When it comes to space heaters, what I have concluded is that digitally controlled heaters are not reliable.  I think the circuitry just can't handle the elevated case temperatures.  Since I haven't had the Laskos very long, I can't speak for their durability, but I think the manual thermostat will mean longer life.  Overall, these Lasko heaters do it all at a good price.  And, I won't feel as sick if they fail as I did with the Vornados.

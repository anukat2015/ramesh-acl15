Title: Best Laptop at the price point, for sure...
Content:
I shopped around and believe me, this is the best "Bang for the Buck" around. I no longer really play games, so the Intel integrated video being the only weak point was no big deal. ***Amazon's Ethernet Specs are Wrong*** This unit does NOT have Gigabit Ethernet, 10/100mb connection only. But everything else is top notch. Core 2 Duo 2.0, Beautiful 16" 720P HD Screen, Vista 64bit Premium (Do yourself a favor and buy the Upgrade to Ultimate 64bit), 320GB HD, 4GB Ram, eSATA, Bluetooth, USB 2.0, docking port, Wireless N!!!, remote and this is one gorgeous laptop.
I added a Gigabit Ethernet Express Card for $50, from Amazon, to make this laptop perfect.
This is a case of "You get MORE than what you pay for..."

Title: quick warm up
Content:
This item is very efficient at warming up a small space, nice to warm up the bedroom prior to retiring for the evening.   The timer, though a bit fussy to set, makes this very convenient to operate.  It is small enough not to be too intrusive in your space. It does indeed make a ticking sound as the metal expands and contracts with heating / cooling, but if this is not a problem I would reccommend this.

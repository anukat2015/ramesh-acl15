Title: love canasters
Content:
This is my second hoover windtunnel, first one was with bags it lasted around 10 years. 
this model has
excellant suction (as long as you emply canaster often)
nice to get it around furniture and under beds.
basic attachements
carpet atteachment workds nice
wide hard floor attachment nice.
Wish it had a better dusting attachment, my old hoover had a real nice one, but the attachments don't fit on the new one.
The problem with this bagles and this is my first bagless is that it is very messy to empty. the filter needs to be pounded on to something to get the dirt out of the creases or the suntion is lower. I have average 12 by 12 rooms with carpeting the canaster needs to be emptied every room, but this does an excellant job pulling out the dust deep down into the carpeting. 
I have had it for a year now. stilll pretty happy, but you wouldn't want to empty this in your trash can in your house all the time. Very dusty work. 
not sure if all bagless are like this. 
The amount of money I have saved on bags over the past year will probably pay for the system in 5 to 6 years. when I purchased this from amazon it was on sale for 180 with free shipping. but I do need to get as extra filter, which I haven't done yet.

Title: It is not as good as Nikon D5000
Content:
Canon T1i is not taking as good pictures as Nikkon D5000. just because it doesn't have quality image and control. D-movie recording is useless on 1080P mode. it is definitely not worth money. it is bulky and heavy too. i am strongly recommend to get Nikon D5000 instead of Canon T1i.

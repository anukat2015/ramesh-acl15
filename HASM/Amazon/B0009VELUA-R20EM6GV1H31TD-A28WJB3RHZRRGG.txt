Title: Makes good coffee when it's not leaking or shutting down
Content:
I bought one of these two years ago and it failed in less than a year. Cuisinart (Conair, the parent company) replaced it under warranty (I had to absorb the shipping costs). The second one has now failed at about 1.5 years. 
The "on-demand" concept is a good one, but if any coffee grains get into the valve which allows the coffee to flow from the carafe to the cup, the thing will leak. I have come into the kitchen many times only to find coffee all over the counter tops. This is a single point failure and one you don't find out until it's too late when the machine has been on automatic.
The other issue is that for the past six months the unit would appear to be dead for half an hour to an hour a day every day. I would have to update the clock every night while setting it up on automatic to make coffee the next day. I think this going-dead behavior happened for the last time and it never came back to life.
I would NOT buy another of these. For the money its too poorly made and short lived. I am looking at buying a European coffee make which is only a bit more money than this one and probably better designed and will last longer.

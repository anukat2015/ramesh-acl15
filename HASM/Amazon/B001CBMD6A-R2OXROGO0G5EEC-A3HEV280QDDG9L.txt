Title: Worth the Wait
Content:
I waited a long time before buying this camera, looked up all the pros and cons. I am so glad I bought it, it is worth the wait. I love the picture quality and ease of use. I bought a book and a lens also to get the most out of the camera but I was able to use it right from the box since I have always had a Canon. The quality of the photos is amazing and I have taken some great shots already. If you are thinking of buying it I say "go for it".

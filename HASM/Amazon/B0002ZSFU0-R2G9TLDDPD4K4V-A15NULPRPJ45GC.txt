Title: Great little vac
Content:
I was looking for two things when shopping for a new cannister vacuum cleaner - 1) a BAG (who ever came up with the idea of filters that are impossible to clean?  give me a BAG!) and 2) white/light colored cord and hose (why are so many black which leaves marks on corners of walls, baseboard, etc.?).  This vacuum cleaner fit the bill and it's nice and compact.  The amps are fewer than my current model but I don't notice a difference.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I can't buy standard attachments for it.  I want to use a bristle type floor attachment, but I can't find one.  I will keep my floor attachment from my other vac but had to go to the local vacuum repair shop and order a special attachment piece to make my Sony connect with my Dirt Devel floor attachment.  I will also remove the attachment holder because as stated by another reviewer, it gets in the way when trying to get under furniture.  But that said, I love my little bagged cannister vacuum with white hose and cord!!

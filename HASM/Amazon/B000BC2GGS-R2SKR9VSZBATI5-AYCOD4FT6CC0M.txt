Title: Silent and quick
Content:
This heater is wonderful on our outside wall of the kitchen near the table.  It makes NO noise and generates all the heat we could want.  While it is easy to set for desired temperature, it doesn't seem to stop when it reaches the temperature I set it at.  The digital readout is large enough to easily see what temperature it is at though.  The automatic turnoff works easily.  I can set it to run from 1-10 hours before it turning off automatically.  The on/off button is conveniently located at the top front too.  I use that when it has gotten warmer than I need.  I'll turn it on again later!

Title: What fun
Content:
This is my first MP3 Player, and it is everything I thought it would be. I now have much of my entire music library within the fashionably thin (and colorful) Nano. When I use the shuffle function it is like having a private DJ play all my favorite music in surprising  and delightful ways. I am pleased.

Title: noisy, noisy.
Content:
Well, it's fairly effective as a heater if you're really close to it. The fan function is pretty useless. The worst part about it to me is how loud it is! Whether it's cooling or heating, it's very noisy. I like a little background noise, but this is like trying to work next to a jet engine...

Title: Incredibly happy
Content:
I have been incredibly pleased with my Canon 20D since purchasing it while serving in Iraq in 2005. The camera has taken some rough handling and done pretty well in various climates.
From personal experience, it won't operate well when the temperature drops below 20 degrees or goes over 130. It's not waterproof. It isn't sand proof. However, it takes excellent, crisp pictures once you learn how to operate it and offers modes for both beginning and experienced photographers. I've used flash memory ranging from 512KB to 8MB with no problems despite having used various brands. 
I love my 20D and have used it to document many important events. Before that I used a 10D with equal pleasure. Now that the 30D and 40D have been released, the 20D should be available for a song.

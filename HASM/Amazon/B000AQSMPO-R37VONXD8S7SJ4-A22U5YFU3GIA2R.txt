Title: Great tasting coffee, quick and easy. Wide Variety.
Content:
I purchased this product for the home, I had planned on keeping my 12 cup coffee maker on the counter to make full pots for company and weekend mornings... That idea lasted about 2 days, my old 12 cup now sits in the basement. My only issue with this product is the environmental unfreindliness of the K-Cups, the manufacturer says they are working this issue and expect to have a Bio Degradable K-Cup soon. I feel even if they just made it so you could more easily pull the foil and filter paper out of the cup to dispose of it would make it easier to recycle the plastic.
Well, other then that I love the ease of operation so much I went out and got a B-40 for my office.

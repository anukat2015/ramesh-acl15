Title: Great SLR camera!
Content:
I bought the Olympus Evolt e 500 for over a year ago. After reviewed other options I decided to go with Olympus, which I use with the Zuiko 18-180 lens.
This camera is great, colors and exposure are excellent, it has many settings to choose from to achieve a great capture. I have been trying other SLR like Nikon and Canon, which are the best brands in the market and also much more expensier, I woud say Olympus does the same work with great quality for an affordable price. 
This camera goes with me every where and I have always been happy with the pictures I get from it. I would recomend this product knowing you will be a 100% happy like I am!

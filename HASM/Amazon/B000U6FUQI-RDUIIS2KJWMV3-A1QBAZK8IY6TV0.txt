Title: It's okay...
Content:
I was somewhat diappointed with this item. I have the Dirt Devil Kone and I love it and I assumed that this product would be the same. The suction isn't great on my tile floor and if there is anything other than just crumbs it won't suck it up. I do not use it as much as I anticipated. So I wouldn't recommend it-I still use the Kone more often.

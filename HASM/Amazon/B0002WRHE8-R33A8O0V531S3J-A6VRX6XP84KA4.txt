Title: Heater exploded
Content:
Bought Big Buddy MH 18B through Amazon 
ser# mhc 748000358386 on Dec 29 2008.
Worked fine for a month then I put it away, I live in AZ mild winters.
A year later Now December 09 I got it out hooked it up correctly and it did a mild explosion fire shot out a foot or 2 and continued until I got the source turned off which was a 20 lb cylinder. The problem was not the hose or connection. Up until now I knew of no recall and my heater was not under the recall anyway. My conclusion is that they don't have the problem fixed yet.

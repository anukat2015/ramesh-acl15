Title: Wonderful and not too big
Content:
I was a bit hesitant from going from my old point and shoot camera to a larger SLR, but decided to try this camera based on the reviews.
I could not be happier.
It takes great photos and it is small enough to be easy to carry around without too much weight or size.
5 stars is not enough for this.

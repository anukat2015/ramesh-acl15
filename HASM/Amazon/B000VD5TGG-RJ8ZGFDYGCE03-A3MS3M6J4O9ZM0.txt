Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I am very disappointed with this machine.  There is virtually no scrubbing capability and the suction power is very poor.  I did all of the trouble shooting with the poor suction and it still did not improve.  The little amount of 'cleaning' capability this machine has is very superficial- it gets a little of the dirt from the surface of the carpet.  I would not recommend it at all.

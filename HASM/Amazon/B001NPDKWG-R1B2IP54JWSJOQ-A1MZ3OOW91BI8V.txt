Title: Impossible to see keyboard
Content:
This would be a nice little laptop but the contrast between the key color and the letters on the keys is not nearly enough to see what keys you are using.  None of my people could use this laptop, even the touch-typers because they still needed to be able to see what the function keys do.(The function keys seem to be different on every laptop.)  I have returned this as it is unusable as shipped and you can't tell by the picture how hard it is to see the keys.

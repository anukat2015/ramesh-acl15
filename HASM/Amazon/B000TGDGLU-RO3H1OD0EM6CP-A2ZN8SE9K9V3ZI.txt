Title: Love this heater!
Content:
We had been looking for a heater to warm our den without having to use the central heat. My husband didn't believe this small heater was up to the job but I ordered it in spite of his objections. It has turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon. It is basically silent and if used correctly, keeps my room with 12' ceilings nice and cozy. The unit itself doesn't get overly hot, so I'm not worried about one of the dogs or children brushing against it and getting a burn. It is very easy to roll around on tile floors and has a generous length of cord. This one works so well that I'm considering getting another for the back part of the house.

Content:
I love this portable A/C unit! I am in Lodi, California, a place where it gets very very hot in the summer. This product arrived on time and undamaged and the delivery guy even came to my door with the box! It is NOT Loud! I read other reviews on this unit and was hesitent about buying it but was relieved to hear it was way quieter then I expected. I have only used it three times because it really isn't hot yet. As far as the drain plug, I inserted a hose to a 1/2 gallon sealed container so catch any draining water. It may or may not evaporate but it is a small inconvenience to keep it running, to dump it, but for the three times I ran it no water went into the container. It cools my room nice and that is all I am hoping for. April-October are my town hot months, so now I am prepared. I reccommend this A/C unit happily! Raymond.

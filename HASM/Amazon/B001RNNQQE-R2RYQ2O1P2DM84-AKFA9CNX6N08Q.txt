Title: Works as advertised
Content:
I've had the DCC-755 for a month now, brewing a pot of coffee every morning. I'm pleased with its performance and the quality of the coffee it brews. I use 8 O'Clock Columbian whole bean coffee and use 10 Tbs. of whole beans for each 10 cup pot.
It's best to fill the metal pot with hot water before brewing in order to help keep the coffee hot. It stays hot enough for about 2 hours and usually needs a shot in the microwave to bring it up to temperature. 
I have a reverse osmosis water filter system so I do not need to use the water filter on the coffee maker and am unable to comment on it.

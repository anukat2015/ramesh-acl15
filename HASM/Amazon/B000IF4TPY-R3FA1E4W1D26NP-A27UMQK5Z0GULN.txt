Title: Probably the best available
Content:
I've owned the Vision-W for about 8 months now.  I use it almost everyday.  I have traveled with it overseas, and use it around the house as a Video player and MP3 player.
The Goods:
* Easy to navigation, good user engineering design
* Great sound! Toss the included headphones and attach a Sennheiser PX-100 and you'll hear things that even Creative didn't imagine this puppy could produce.
* Not flimsy. Solid, a bit heavy, and big, but feels like it won't fall apart.  As I've mentioned, I've traveled with it quite extensively and it really holds up to the bumps and bruises.
* Easy to add/edit to your collection.  You can use the supplied software, or just use Windows Explorer and in most cases just drag and drop. 
* Video display is gorgeous.  'Nuff Said.
* Locking and unlocking display is super simple with a flick of the on button.  When listening to Audio, you can lock and the display will go black, for further power savings.
* Cables provided to hook up and play video directly to your TV/Monitor. It looks gorgeous there too.
* Recharge with provided power adapter and with USB cable. This is great for airport stops.  Your laptop is plugged in, and your Vision-W is recharging with the USB.
* Accepts Compact Flash cards to upload audio, video, and photos (although you can't play directly from the card, you have to download it to the player first).
* Easy integration with Zencast for podcast management.
The Bads:
* 30GB is not alot by today's standards
* Does not fit easily in pocket
* Doesn't play all video formats, and conversion from FLV to a pocket AVI format (using the supplied software) takes _forever_. 
Wishes (For next version):
* 160GB to match the Ipod Classic.
* Play all video formats without clumsy conversion. Especially Divx and FLV (which are currently not supported)
* A bit lighter...
All in all, this is a wonderful player, and i have tested some of the competition. If you want to be 'trendy', get yourself an Ipod. If you want a clumsy interface, get an Archos. If you want the best out there, with the caveats mentioned, get the Vision-W.

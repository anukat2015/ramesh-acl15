Title: Warm in June
Content:
DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp Technology Box arrived all bent & crushed but product was OK. Works well but was only used for a damp, chilly week in June so real test won't come until fall/winter. Electric bill went up for month of June by about $40 but also had a warm week of AC usage so hard to tell if radiator added to increase.

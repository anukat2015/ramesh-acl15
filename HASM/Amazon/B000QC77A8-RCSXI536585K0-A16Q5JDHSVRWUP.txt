Title: Great Heater, better than oil filled heaters
Content:
I purchased this heater due to the cold weather we had in Miami, Florida. My house has no heat and does not have quality insulation or double payne windows. 
Before the heater the house was the same temperature as the outdoors come early morning. The heater heats a large 12x16 room in about ten minutes and keeps it comfortable with little effort.
It is light, compact, and quiet. It can be moved to another room and in just a few minutes that room is comfortable.
When I lived in upstate New York, we had an oil filled heater. This works better and is more efficient. I would reccomend this heater to anyone, especially someone who needs one more than I do. 
I did not have a problem with a smell when I used it for the first time.

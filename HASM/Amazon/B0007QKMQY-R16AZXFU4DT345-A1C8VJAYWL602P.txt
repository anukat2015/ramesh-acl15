Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
Bought the Canon Rebel XT primarily to take pictures of grandkids' sporting events.  I'm not an expert photographer, but am able to take great pictures in both outdoor and indoor settings. (I also bought a telephoto lens.) I especially like the ability to take rapid shots to  later review to choose the best ones to save and print.  The Rebel XT is easy to use and with the accomopanying software one can efficiently crop, enhance and print various size pictures.  This is the 4th digital camera I've bought and is by far the best (but not the most expensive) one I've owned.

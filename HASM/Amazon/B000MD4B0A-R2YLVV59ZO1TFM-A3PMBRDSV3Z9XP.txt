Title: Buy another brand
Content:
I was very disappointed in this product. The user interface is awful. It's difficult to use and there are some very basic features like fast forward and volume control that are badly implemented in the design. If you listen to audio books this is not the product for you. It has a tendency to restart the book from the beginning and it's impossible to fast forward to where you left off.

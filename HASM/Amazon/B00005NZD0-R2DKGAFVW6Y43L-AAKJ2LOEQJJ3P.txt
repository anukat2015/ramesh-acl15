Title: Beginner machine
Content:
It seems like any time you cram multiple units together, quality suffers. This is no exception. I have owned this unit for about 4 years. I have never had a problem with it, while using it daily. But.....a quality cup of espresso will never happen. Crema is non existant! Unless you make the full carafe of espresso, it will only come out luke warm. I have pre-heated cups to help a bit, but still is only warm. I use Illy, Starbucks, and Passalaqua with different grinds and tamps with no improvement.The steamer works great. The coffee machine gets 95% of my daily use. It is slow, but makes a better cup than Starbucks does. Because of this, I have not up graded yet. All in all, you get good coffee maker and a poor espresso maker. What do you expect for under $100. Right?

Title: good for the price

What can I say?  I was looking for an inexpensive heater to keep me from being too cold while working at home.  This one was on sale for $10.  It works well.  I've only used it on the low setting.  It does not have any temperature regulation, it's either on low or high or fan, so don't expect to set a temperature like 65 degrees and then walk away and have it regulate the temperature in the room.  One disappointment to me is that the fan does not slow down for the lower setting, but that's a minor issue.  Overall, well worth the money in my opinion.  
I should note that there's a place to wrap the cord on the bottom of the unit but it is not easy to wrap the cord because it is inside the base, so that part could be redesigned.  But, as I said, it's a good heater for the money.

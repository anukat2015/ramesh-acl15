Title: Solid Value
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner to replace an aging 15+ year old Electrolux. It cleans as well. The tool carrying feature is very handy, and it's a lot quieter. At its current price point, it's a solid value. To get an even quieter unit, you'd have to spend at least twice as much. My wife likes it better than the old Electrolux as well.

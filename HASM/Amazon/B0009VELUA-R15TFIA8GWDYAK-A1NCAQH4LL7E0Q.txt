Title: Very Pleased!
Content:
This is a very easy to use coffee maker and it makes great coffee.  Easy clean up and it's great not having to have a carafe to handle and care for.  The beep that is heard when the coffee is ready is not at all annoying to us... in fact it is a nice convenience.  We were pleasantly surprised how much we like this product!

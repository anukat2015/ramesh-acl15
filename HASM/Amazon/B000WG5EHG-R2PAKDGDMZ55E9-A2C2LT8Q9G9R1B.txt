Title: Don't waste your cash
Content:
Bought this a year ago for my son's birthday.  It was hard to set up and the website is most confusing...then have to use their exclusive online membership to download songs...can't use Rhapsody or others...so then i'm paying for two memberships for two sons.   The Zune tho...what a P.O.S!  We continually had trouble with it and it just stopped working altogether in December (after owning it for a total of 9 months)  It won't charge, turn on, do anything.   Trying to get some technical support is ridiculous.  Again, their website is confusing and layered.  It seems they try to make it difficult so you just give up.  (which we did for several months)  Had to come back to Amazon (God Bless Them) for the purchase info.   But i still doubt i'll get anywhere.  makes me crazy that i spent $150 on this for nothing.  Ended up buying him a replacement SANSA for Christmas that works great, cost a fraction of what the zune cost and syncs with common online song downloads.  
PLEASE don't give Microsoft any more of your money and avoid this.

Title: perhaps mine is a lemon
Content:
Pretty amazing to see all these positive reviews. I got my TRH0715 yesterday ($49 at Sears) and it still reeks of oil a bit after over 12 hrs of use. But the worst part is that even turned all the way up it only raises my room temperature by a couple of degrees. Granted, I have the house pretty cool - right now the thermostat is set to 53F, but even so, my dinky forced air ceramic heater can get this office up to 60F after a couple/few hours.
This is my first oil filled radiator type space heater. I'm hoping that they are not all like this because I like the idea of quiet steady heat. I plan to get another brand to compare and if it is much better than this DeLonghi the DeLonghi is going back to the store.

Title: Heating As Designed
Content:
The heater works as advertised.  I have almost finished my second 20lb propane tank using this heater with no issues.  I am located at about 5400 feet above sea level for those with concerns about using it at altitude.  I have noticed that on the high setting (it also has low and medium) it tends to produce a slight propane odor.  This is most likely due to the lower quantity of oxygen at our altitude, and therefore does not produce a complete burn.  However, the medium heat setting works great and gets my 2 car garage comfortably warm in about 30 minutes.

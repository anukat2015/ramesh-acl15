Title: Great range of control, heats well, turns itself off by temp or timer.  Very good with a small complaint about the cord.
Content:
I take one star away for the cord, otherwise this is a great product that heats nearly as well and as quietly as a kerosene heater of the same size.
The cord though is a genuine design flaw.  It gets rather warm when plugged in and should be replaced with something a bit more heavily insulated and more abrasion resistant.  One bad scratch and this thing will be waiting to explode and start a fire.
Noting the problem with the cord, I'm a bit leary of leaving this heater  unattended, though I have left it with the timer on to shut itself off several times and no problems yet.  As it gets older though, it's more likely to have a problem of course.
BOTTOM LINE: Great heater, though it really needs to have a heavier cord.  And this is such a cheap improvement in the design that I can't figure why Lasko wouldn't have included it if for no other reason than consumer safety confidence in their product.
I recommend the heater, but add that you should be very careful to make sure the cord is in good shape as you continue to use it.
We are looking to replace ours for general use just because of the cord issue, though I will continue to use this heater in my muck room--where I keep and work on my bicycles.

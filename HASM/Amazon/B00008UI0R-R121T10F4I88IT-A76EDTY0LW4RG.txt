Title: great little sucker, but small canister
Content:
Just a short review: As a German I am used to canister vacuums.  This thing is great: it really has great suction and the carpet brush works awesome.  The cable is long enough and the vacuum does not tip over like a lot of other canisters.  The handle can be adjusted to be very long which provides comfortable vacuuming for tall people like me...
The only thing I don't like is the small tank.  After a big "dirty" room, you have to empty the canister....

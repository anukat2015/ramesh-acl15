Title: Not good for pet hair
Content:
I bought this based on many of the reviews that said it was great for pet hair. I have two dogs. It is terrible for pet hair.
I am constantly pulling built up hair out of the bristles, unclogging the hose, cleaning out the path from the brush to the hose, etc. 
While it does seem to pull dirt, it refuses to actually clean hair off the carpet, and it lays the hair out in a static-y mess on the floor.

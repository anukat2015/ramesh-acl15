Ipod Nano 16gb came before estimated arrival. My first experience with digital downloads and ipod. I have absolutely no experience doing this and it was a piece of cake Apple rocks. I am sure everyone knows this. I first bought 8gb and found I had 7.1gb that I ripped from my own music. So returned and got 16gb. Everyone tells me I will want more storage. We will see. Buy this if it is your first experienc.

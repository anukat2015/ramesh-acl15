Title: Mixed Bag : Awesome sound quality - abismal file support and slacker is an advertising gimmick
Content:
The positives of this player have been mentioned in other's reviews but I'll mentioned them briefly:  
The only reason I have not yet returned the player is because the sound quality is indeed very good.  
The wifi works well for the youtube features. 
The FM radio receiver is decent.
However, one of the selling points of the player - slacker radio support - does not work very well at all.  The player refuses to refresh slacker stations properly.   I'm not impressed with the included web browser either.  Many of the mp3 files that work just fine on two other player that I have cause this player to freeze up.  
If this was a cheaper player, then these problems might not be so bad. However, for this price if you advertise something to work, it better work or you will have PO'd customers.
I do not return purchases very often at all but unless I can get the slacker radio and mp3 file issues work out, it is very likely I will be returning it.

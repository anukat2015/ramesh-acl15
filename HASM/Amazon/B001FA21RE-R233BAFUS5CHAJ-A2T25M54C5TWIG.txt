Title: Good coffee but two have broken in less than a year
Content:
We got up this morning to have coffee and once again, our machine won't work.  No light; nothing.  We returned one about 5 months ago for the exact same problem so hopefully they will replace this one, too.  If not, we also spoke with Dolce Gusto customer service (1-800-745-3391)who were very helpful and provided a number for Krups who they said would replace it for us.  We like the machine when it works but would be very hesitant to recommend to anyone because of the problems we've had.

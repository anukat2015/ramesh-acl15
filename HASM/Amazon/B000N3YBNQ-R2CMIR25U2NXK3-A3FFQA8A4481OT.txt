Title: Impressive Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I just received my Intersity Vacuum cleaner today and after the first use I am very impressed with its performance  My carpets and rugs look so much better than when I had used my older vacuum.  It is so light and easy to manuever and so far is doing an excellent job.

Title: Great taste, messy counters
Content:
W jumped on this product as it was the first one on the block with a 12 cup capacity in a thermal caraffe.  BUMMER! The counters never seem to be dry, or clean!  The Coffee maker overflows at the drop of a hat.  The Manufacturer responded very nicely to our emails, and sent a new lid, and cone.  But this did not come close to solving the problems!  I am now finally looking for a new coffee pot.

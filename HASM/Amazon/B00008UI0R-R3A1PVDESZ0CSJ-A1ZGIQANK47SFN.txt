Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
I bought this vacuum to clean my mostly hardwood main floor so I could move my dyson upright upstairs, where we have more carpet.  Once I got used to maneuvering around with the canister, it has been a great weapon against the dog hair and small child generated dirt and crumbs that plague my busy household.  Great suction, great attachments, and I love the simplicity of the bagless dirt collection.  The telescoping wand feature is nice, making it adaptable for persons of various heights to vacuum comfortably (important for husband cleaning recruitment).  I have also enjoyed the adjustable suction feature for cleaning more delicate items like drapes, tassle rugs, and lampshades.  I would not dare touch these things with my tornado suction Dyson for fear of destroying them!  The only small drawbacks as other reviewers have mentioned are- SHORT cord-  I solved this by leaving a really long extention cord plugged into the vacuum all the time, so I can vacuum the entire downstairs on one plug.  Heavy extention wand- the rest of the vacuum is very light and maneuverable but this thing is made of some really heavy steel.  Could be used as home defense I guess.  Small dirt collection container- needs to be emptied frequently, especially if you have pets.  In contrast, the long cord, light extension pole, and large dirt collection container are all things I was used to on my Dyson upright, which is a fabulous vacuum for cleaning regular carpets.  Overall, this vacuum accomplishes the purpose for which I bought it very well and is ideal for households that have a lot of hardwood and tile to clean.  I would definitely buy it again.

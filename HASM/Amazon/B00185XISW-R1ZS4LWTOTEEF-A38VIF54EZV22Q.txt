Title: decent heater
Content:
This heater is just right.  I am heating a 10 by 17 room that we rarely use.  It doesn't get real warm in there but keeps it at around 60 when it's 20 or above outside.  It is warm to the touch but not dangerous.  It would probably get alot warmer in the room but it has large windows. I might buy one for  my bathroom where I know it would give me plenty of heat. I would recomment this heater.

Title: Toddler Friendly
Content:
I bought this for my 3yr old daughter last year and she absolutely loves it. It is kid friendly and was easy for her to learn to use. It also has an extra headphone port that her brother can plug into and listen. I like being able to simply load a SD card with music, putting it in the Shaker and she is off dancing! 
Good, Child Friendly product!

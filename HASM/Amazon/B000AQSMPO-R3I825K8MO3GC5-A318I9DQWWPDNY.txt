Title: Awesome coffee maker - if you pre soak the pod
Content:
I love the look and the convenience; however the coffee comes out very weak when using the medium cup or the larger mug setting.  A remedy for this is to interrupt the brewing process.  Basically when the coffee just starts to drip, I open up the lid and stop it for 20-30 seconds, thus allowing the k-cup to pre soak.  Then I close the lid and the brewing continues.  The coffee comes out awesome.  You don't even need to buy the extra bold cups.  I wish Keurig had a slower drip setting to get the most of each k-cup, but my method works pretty well.

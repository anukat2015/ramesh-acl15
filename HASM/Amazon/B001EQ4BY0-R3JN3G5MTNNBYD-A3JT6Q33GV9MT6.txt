Title: Canon 50d SLR
Content:
Just as exected ,
actually easier than expected,
Picture quality higher than Pentax SLR's 
but different and not as easy to use.
Better lens choices and lensa vailible.
Pricy lens and not stabillization or HD Video built in..,not necessary
but would be nice to have!

Title: ASUS laptop
Content:
This is a remarkable laptop, light and fast.
The battery life is amazing, both my wife and I use this laptop for routine chores and checking our email--it has met all expectations, the battery life has been right around what it claims, 12 hours.
This processor is speedy, we run several programs that push the processor to its limits and it has never had any problems running two major applications at once.
The only drawback of this machine is its lack of an internal DVD drive--we have an external one, so really not that big a deal.

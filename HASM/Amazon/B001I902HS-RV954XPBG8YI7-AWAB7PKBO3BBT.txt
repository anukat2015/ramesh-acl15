Title: Handy vacuum but does it compare to Dyson
Content:
The first question on my mind was does it suck?  It has decent suction but not as strong as some other uprights or the Dyson.  The suction is adjustable - why anyone would want to use less than full suction, I would not know.  Some of its features make up for its loss in suction power.  The canister style lends for great agility and the handle has the power switch right at your fingertips.  You can switch from carpet to bare floor mode on the fly.  The difference is that in floor mode, the brush does not spin.  You also have the ability to disassemble the roller mechanism so you can get rid those hair tangles that have burnt out so many motors and broken so many drive belts.
Another cautionary note is that this unit is not bagless which is a plus in my view since every time I empty out the dust cup it flies everywhere.  The major flaw is that no one carries the bags!!!  Amazon does not sell them and I only found one website that charges $11 plus S&H (ouch!)  I am sure that this is destined to change in the future.
The HEPA filter is amazingly good and I did not notice a lot of odor kickout which means that the filter is pretty fine.  I have not used the Dyson canister vac so I am not sure how it compares to the latter.  After using this unit, I am now convinced that I only want to go the canister route.  I have heard great things about the Miele, but those go for $600-$1000.

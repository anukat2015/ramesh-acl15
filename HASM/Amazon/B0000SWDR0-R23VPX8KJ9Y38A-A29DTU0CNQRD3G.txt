Title: Run!  Run!  Run! from this machine!
Content:
I have two dogs, so I purchased this vacuum for its flexibility.  The Consumer Reports website rated it highly.  It worked great a couple times, then the problems started.  The power head began to work intermittently, especially after 10 minutes or so of use.  Then the release switch on the power head broke.  The bag change indicator doesn't come on until the bag is overfull.  That makes it almost impossible to change without breaking the bag and spilling dust in the bag container.  Plus, the bag is really small.  I drove the vacuum to a certified repair center 35 miles from my home where it's being held hostage.  That was almost 3 months ago.  As soon as I walked in with it, the guy laughed and said this machine is a hunk of junk.  Well, it's still under warranty but I think Electrolux should extend it according to the amount of time it's been in the shop!

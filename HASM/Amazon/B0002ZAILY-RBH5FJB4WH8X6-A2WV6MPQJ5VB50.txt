Title: Great Product
Content:
I have never owned an Mp3 player before but because of the low price I decided to buy this one on valentines day. I think the product is great and the sound is great. I hooked it up to my car stero (with an accessory) and transfered all my cds to it. As far as not having a screen, I think that it is not a big deal. If you just put your songs on it in the order you want them why do you need a screen?  I love it and find it easy to use. If you want something simple, small, and easy to use this is for you. Where else can you get an Mp3 player that has 512mb for $99?

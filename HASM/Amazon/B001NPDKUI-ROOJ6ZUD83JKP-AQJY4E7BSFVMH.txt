Title: Terrible experience..stay away from this
Content:
Worked well for a month and then the USB ports stopped working, followed by a dead webcam. Keyboard area is made of cheap plastic and not sure how long that will last.
Spent hours with HP tech support but so far no luck. Reco is to wipe out and re-install the OS & software. I may have to spend a lot of time with no guarantee if the problems will be fixed. SUX!!

Title: love it!!
Content:
This is wonderful.  No more messy filters to clean, no more remembering to fill the pot at night or stumbling to the pot in the morning, no more wasted coffee down the drain.  I am glad I chose to upgrade to the B70, 4 sizes to chooose from.  My kids love to make tea and hot cocoa but due to the expense of the Ghiardelli cocoa and K cup teas we ahve been using the teabags we have at home and also Swiss Miss hot cocoa packs.  The best part is you have tea, coffee, cocoa instantly when you want it!! The Green mountain coffee is extremely weak, but the Timothy's Kona and Columbian are awesome--really rich, full flavor.

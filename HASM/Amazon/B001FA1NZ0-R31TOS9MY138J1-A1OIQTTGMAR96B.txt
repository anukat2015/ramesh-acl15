Title: Currently not suitable for workouts.
Content:
I've had my iPod Shuffle (3G) for about a week, and it failed several times halfway through my workout. The controls seems to short-circuit by the moisture/sweat and it would either pause, go into playlist VoiceOver, or change volume on its own. This seems to be a problem many people are experiencing from Apple's user discussion groups. I am currently working with Apple support on getting it replaced, but from some of the postings on the discussion group, the replacement seems to be the same headset design and suffers from the same problem. 
I would not recommend the iPod Shuffle (3G) for workout activities until this problem has been resolved.

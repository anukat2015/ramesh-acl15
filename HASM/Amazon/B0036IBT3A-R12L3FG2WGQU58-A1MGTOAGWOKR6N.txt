Title: a piece of junk
Content:
I have nothing but Bissell vacuums. The Butler Revolution was a wonderful canister but is no longer available, so I thought the Zing would be just as good. The Zing is Bissell's Edsel. No suction, it runs hot, it's piece of junk. I sent it back to the company. They said there was nothing wrong with it and returned it to me. I had my neighbors try it and they were of the same opinion as me: A PIECE OF JUNK. Buyers beware. The Zing is a zilch. It sucks, but it does not suck dirt!

Title: could be better
Content:
This is a good machine for the money and the coffee tastes good from this machine and stays hot in the carafe for about four hours. The idea of the carafe is good because the coffee stays hot and tastes better because it doesn't burn on a warmer. There are several design problems however. 1. it poors too slowly out of the carafe. 2. the filter door is tricky to open. 3. the carafe top doesn't screw on easily. 4. the "poor while you brew" feature is touchy and coffee leaks because the spring designed to stop the coffee flow seems weak. I've had the unit for about three months and the writing on the control panel is wearing off.

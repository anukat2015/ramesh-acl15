Title: Worked two years, then nothing, wouldn't buy another

Honeywell HZ519 Digital Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater
I used this heater for two years.  The thermostat was not accurate, ever.  It did heat the room when we set it high, but it didn't shut off.
When we brought out the heater in the third year winter, it was dead.  Nothing.
The screws holding the heater together have a proprietary bizarre head, so you cannot even get into the unit to attempt to determine the problem.
No support is available.  The manual is worthless.
It is very likely an issue with the inferior controls
It is built in China for Honeywell, and isn't apparently repairable.
It is not worth what we paid for it.  Cheaper heaters have lasted longer for us.
I will likely not buy another Honeywell unit

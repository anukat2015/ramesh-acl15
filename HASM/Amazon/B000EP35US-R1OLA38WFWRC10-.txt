Title: the ipod nano a mp3 player thats good
Content:
ok my friend came over and brought his nano over and it took us 3 hrs. to download at least one song now some peole might say wow because it took us so long but we r 12. and then we had to figure out how to get it ON the ipod. dang that took so long until we got 5 songs on. Be prepare for long hrs. of frustation and plenty of tears.Ofcourse, after that it was real easy to download music.

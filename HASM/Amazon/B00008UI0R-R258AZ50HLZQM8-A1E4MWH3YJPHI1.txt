Title: Upright or Canister???
Content:
We never had a canister vac before, but after reading up on how to choose, I decided to go caniste because most of our flooring is now ceramic tile and oak flooring with only 2 large carpeted rooms. Even though the order process said to expect 2 weeks for delivery, it was sent the next morning and arrived in 2 days! We put it together and tested it on the living room  carpet AFTER we had vacuumed it with our older upright Bissel bagless. We were pretty amazed at how much fine dirt it picked up, so we knew then that we could not go back to the old upright. The pther thing that we noticed quickly was how much the vac head pulls itself forward...so it is easy to go forward, but a little strenuous to pull it back. I thoght the construction materials were solid enogh, but the fit of the wand was a bit loose. The suction and has 3 levels, and is very powerful. It is fairly difficult to "haul around" the living room carpet....the hose gets in the way, and the canister does not roll easily enough. The cord return works well enough. The dirt container looks big, but once the tiny bottom of it fills up, it starts clogging up quickly, especially if you have pet hair on the carpet. It pretty much needs emptied after each use, but that is not too much effort. Because of the fne dust and dirt it picks up, it seems to stick to the inside of the dirt container, and must be dry wiped on occasion. Aftr using it a few weeks now, we find that we do not use it n the wood or ceramic floors, because it is less hassle to just use a broom ! If we had to do it over, we would probably try to pick an equivalent upright, although I wouldn't know how to pick an eqivalent one.

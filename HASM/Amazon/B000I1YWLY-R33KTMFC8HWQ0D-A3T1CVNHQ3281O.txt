Title: Great Vacuum, do yourself a favor and get one!
Content:
I dont normally write reviews but I am very impressed with this vacuum!
My wife and I bought an Electrolux canister vacuum back in 1995 or so.  We were very happy with that purchase for years.  As of the last few years however we were constantly replacing small parts like hoses, wands and switches. The motor still runs strong, it is all the other peices that kept failing. These parts arent cheap and the costs were adding up. It broke down again and we decided not to fix it. Even though the company that made our Electolux is different from this new Electrolux becasue of the great reviews we decided to order one.
I cannot speak to the longevity of this vacuum but its current performance is FANTASTIC!
My wife is a bit of a clean freak.  As such our vacuum got plenty of use. Our old Electrolux broke down.  She borrowed her moms upright Hoover.  The Hoover seemed to clean better than the old Electrolux. The next day our new Electrolux came in. I was both amazed and disgusted at how much dirt it picked up! The canister was almost filled on the first use. The rugs were noticably fluffier after vacuuming!  This is NOT in our head, it really does a great job.  After a half a dozen vacuums it is still picking up dirt that is deep down in the carpet. It is truly impressive.
As mentioned, I cannot speak to how long this vacuum will last.  I figure we will get plenty of use out of it with a 2 year warranty.  In the meantime it is doing a fantastic job.  
Highly recommended!

Title: iPod Video 30GB review
Content:
I am very pleased with my new iPod, does everything it was designed to do (plays music) with a little bonus (plays videos and pictures). 
Apple has gotten it right again, with the perfect compromize of function and size. I really am amazed at how thin the 30GB iPod. I got the 30GB iPod as an upgrade to my old 20GB, and the 30GB is considerably thinner. 
This iPod generation (the 5th one) is the first one that has been competitively priced. Prior to this generation of iPod, there was always a cheaper option from Dell or Creative that offered the same features without the simplicity and beauty of iPod. Now it's really a no brainer that iPod is the better choice, since Apple has packed a lot of bang for your buck.
The video looks stunning and crisp. Even at at mere 2.5 inches, it is still enjoyable to watch last night's episode of Lost or Desperate Housewives. I have even ripped DVD's to the iPod using "Handbrake" (a program for Mac only).
As with previous generations of iPod, music is the primary functionality. It is still the best music player out there, hands down. 
The only negative thing I can think of is that the screen and back scratch easily. I suggest buying an invisibleShield, for 100% durable, permanent protection. (check out theinvisibleshield.com)

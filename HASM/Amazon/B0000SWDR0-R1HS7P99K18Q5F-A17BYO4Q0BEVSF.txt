Title: Its really a eureka
Content:
I bought this vacuum thinking I was getting an electrolux - which I know to be a quality product.  Turns out that eureka bought the license to use the electrolux name.  I used the vacuum for a week and it already is not working.  I would like to return it and buy a real electrolux from an electrolux dealer.

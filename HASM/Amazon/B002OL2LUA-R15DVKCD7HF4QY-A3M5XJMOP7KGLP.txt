Title: It's a big and cheap laptop, but not good for LINUX fans !
Content:
I bought this laptop at Best Buy for $720!  It's a bargain for its screen size and blue-ray DVD, plus 6 GB memory!  However, the webcam is only at a resolution of 640x480 ( not HD quality).  And the worst part is that I can't get any network adapter ( Atheros and RealTek ) working with the latest Ubuntu !   
So it's not a bargain for Linux fans!

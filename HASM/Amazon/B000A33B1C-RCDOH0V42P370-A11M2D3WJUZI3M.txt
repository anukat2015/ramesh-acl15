Title: Quartz vs Oil filled
Content:
Several weeks ago I purchased a Delonghi 1500w Oil-F[lled Radiator as supplement heat for my woodworking shop which is 24 feet by 28 feet.  When it arrived I took it straight out of the box and plugged it in on high.  It heated up with no off gasses and put out a fair amount of heat.  It didn't make a noticable difference until I put a small fan behind it to help circulate the air which helped condiderably. Since this is a good looking unit I decided to trade it for my old Marvin 1500w which I use in the main part of the house.  I was amazed at the difference between the two.  The 1500w quartz heater was much better at heating up my shop than the 1500w oil filled radiator.  This was confirmed by my wife wanting the return of the quartz heater to the main part of the house.
Conclusion 1500w quartz outpreforms 1500w oil-filled by 30%.

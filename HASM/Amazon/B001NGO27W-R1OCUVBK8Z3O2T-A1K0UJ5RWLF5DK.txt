Title: Cuisinart 14 cup
Content:
Great coffee maker!  We had a KitchenAid previously, but when it died had to search frantically for a replacement.  The 14 cup capacity has to be one of the best features.  No more fighting over the coffee in my house.  The water is easy to fill; LOVE the outside measuring!  We also really like the feature that allows us to adjust the automatic shut-off time.  Makes it really convenient and customizable to the day.  Makes a great cup of coffee every time.

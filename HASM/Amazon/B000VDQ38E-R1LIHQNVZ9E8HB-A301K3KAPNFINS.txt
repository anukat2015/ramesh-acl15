Title: very pleased..
Content:
I adore this vacuum. For the price, you really can't beat it. It is quite large, but it is very easy to push- not heavy at all. I used to dread vacuuming with my old dirt devil, but now I vacuum all the time! It doesn't seem like such a chore:) It works well on everything- furniture, bare floors, etc. I am definitely glad I made the purchase!

Title: Great camera for the price
Content:
I am not an expert at photography but I bought this camera for a trip we took to Istanbul.  I had used my point and shoot before and knew that unless the conditions were perfect I would miss alot of shots.  I did do research on other cameras and thought this one provided the best bang for the buck even though it cost a bit more than lots of other entry line DSLRs.  I was not disappointed with the performance and found the camera relatively easy to use once I had watched a video and reviewed a book specific to this camera. The big thing that I liked about it was the ability to get some great shots under all kind of conditions.  The live shot feature was good too but didn't use it much. In many of the mosques and museums a flash was not allowed or would not have been effective anyways but I was able to get some great shots anyways.  The battery lasts a long long time too so you don't have to worry about running out of juice.  I have no regrets of getting the camera.

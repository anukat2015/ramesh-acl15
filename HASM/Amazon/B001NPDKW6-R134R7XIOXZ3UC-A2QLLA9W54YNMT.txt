Title: FAULTY ADAPTER
Content:
Hi 
I bought my HP Pavillion DV6-1030US on June 3rd 2009, great machine, easy to use, even recommended it to friends who inturn purchased similar machines. to my dismay March 2010 my adapter developed a short and is now completely dead. Is this the standard life span for an adapter? have I been recommending this machine, rating it highly to everyone that has seen it and it's going to disappoint them in less than a year? So now I have a really cool laptop that I cannot power up! maybe someone can advise me as to my next step

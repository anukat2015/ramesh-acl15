Title: Great vacuum but I can't buy belts/bags,etc. in any of my local stores anymore.
Content:
I would be very skeptical when buying this or any other Electrolux product.  I bought mine from Lowe's.  I didn't realize they were going to stop selling it.  They did within months of my purchase and stopped selling the belts and bags within six months.  I went to other stores and I haven't had any luck.  I also went to the Electrolux vacuum sales/service center.  I was told Eureka owned the small vacuum business(the cheap vacuums).  So now if I buy these then I must buy them off of Amazon and pay shipping every time.  Who knows how long I'll be able to buy them here?  Don't buy this vacuum!!!!  I will never even buy a Electrolux appliance now.  I don't trust them.

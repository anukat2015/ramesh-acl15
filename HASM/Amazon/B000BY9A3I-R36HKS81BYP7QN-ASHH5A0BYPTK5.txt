Title: Excellent Vaccum
Content:
I have mostly hardwood floors and a standup vacuum just wouldn't cut it. I read the reviews and decided to order this vacuum. I am so glad I did, It is fantatstic and I don't mind vacuuming at all any more. This vacuum picks up everything. There was a problem with my 1st order and the vacuum wouldn't turn on. I called the mechant and their customer service was aweful but eventually replaced it and it is the best vacuum I have ever owned. It is able to get into all the corners and attachements are very easy to access. A definate Best Buy!

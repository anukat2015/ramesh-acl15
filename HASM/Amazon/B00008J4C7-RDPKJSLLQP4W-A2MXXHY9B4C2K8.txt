Title: Attachments break easily
Content:
For what I paid for it, the vacuum has performed well enough, however the attachments break at the drop of a hat.  I've had this for a year and have no working attachments left for it.  Fortunately, replacements are currently available, but I wouldn't count on that always being the case.  Steer clear.

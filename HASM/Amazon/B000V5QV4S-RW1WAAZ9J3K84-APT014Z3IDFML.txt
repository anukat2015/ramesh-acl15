Title: Awesome camera, all you would ever need
Content:
Hey,
The 40D is probably one of the best semi-pro DSLRs out currently (Aug 2009)... well as far as Canon goes. It is not over-loaded with megapixels, like the newer version. I actually bought it, when price had dropped to about $800. When the 50D came out, a lot of people complained that the newer 50D was very noisy (I don't know if that's true). But, because of the negative reviews on the 50D, the 40D price jumped back up, to about $1100. I'm glad I got it, while the price was good. Honestly, think that 10 megapixels... maybe 12, is about the max; mostly because after that, the image size starts taking up a lot of space, with very little gain. With this 40D, (10mp) I can get a decent crop and still enlarge to 16x20 without problems.

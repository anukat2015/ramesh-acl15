Title: Pretty good for that price
Content:
I ordered this vacuum cleaner not too long ago and used it few times so far, it seems it does the job I needed.. I have a carpeted good size studio apartment, little areas without carpeting.. the suction seems pretty good, first it seemed it does suck like a "tornado" like someone has already described in other review, now it seems not as strong as first time, but still does pretty good job.. I have to empty the plastic container every time, but it is very easy to do, just dump and rinse. Filter doesnt seem to clog too much, so I think in general it is worth to get this vacuum as you have to pay way too much for better ones and they do similar job.. so I would say it is great investment for smaller place, but definetely go for better one if you have a big house..

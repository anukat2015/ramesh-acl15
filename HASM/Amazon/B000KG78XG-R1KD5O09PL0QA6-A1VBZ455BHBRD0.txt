Title: Leica V-Lux 1 is a surprise in its simplicity
Content:
This camera was a total (GOOD) surprise when I received it.  I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND OPERATE IT ! You have no idea how important this was to me. The camera's "buttons" and menus make sense and the Instruction book is actually understandable.  This was important to me because I glaze over badly when I am confronted with a techie piece of equipment.  Other shocks about this camera were the incredible amount of USEABLE zoom -- up to 85 X zoom, and the stabilizer control that can actually stabilize the picture at huge zooms. Example: I have quite a clear and full frame picture of a hovering harrier bird that I took with this camera from 300 yards away. Anoither pleasant thing: when you choose one of the "programs" like "portrait", "landscape", "night sky", "candle light" etc. that the ACTUAL DESCRIPTION of exactly what the program does comes right up in clear English language on the screen.  This Leica ranks among the best products i've owned.

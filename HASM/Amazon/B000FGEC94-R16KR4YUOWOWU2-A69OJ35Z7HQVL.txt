Title: Clix is  a hit!
Content:
This little MP3 is the best one that I own.  I own 3 different ones (Creative vision m, sandisk 4gb and the Clix).  Out of all 3 it is the best by far.  I like the fact that it does pictures, videos, playlists etc..  It also has equalizers on it.  That's a nice touch.  The screen is really amazing and the pictures just don't show how great it really is.  I mean great.  It is a fingerprint magnet, so I put a cover on it.  The sound quality is fabulous!  Better than my other players and the funny thing is this one was the least expensive!!! I notice that my Sandisk and Creative have hissing sounds on certain songs.  I didn't notice it on the Clix though. It's very easy to use.  You can drag and drop.  It was the first one I owned and the easiet to learn.  The manual isn't the greatest, but the tech support was helpful.  The only thing I wish that I currently have is more space.  Two Gb is better than 1, but I with it came with either 4 or 8 gig.  I can't think of anything wrong with it.  The earphones sound great but are a little big for my ears and my ears don't think they are that comfy.  All the headphones that came with all of my MP3s are too large for me and are uncomfy.  You will love this player!

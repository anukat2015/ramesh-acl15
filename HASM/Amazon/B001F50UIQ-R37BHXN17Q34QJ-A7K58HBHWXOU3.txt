Title: Old Guy Review
Content:
Being 67 years old and wanting something simple to use I used previous reviews to settle on the Sony 4GB Walkman MP3 Player.
I couldn't be more satisfied.It comes with a cd that allows dowloading an excellent tutorial along with Windows Media Player 11. Instructions are clear and concise. I had read in one review that you couldn't delete songs. This was untrue as its simple, but does require being hooked to your computer.
If I can use this anyone can and they will be very satisfied with the quality, ease of use and sound quality.
I bought another Sony for my wife !!

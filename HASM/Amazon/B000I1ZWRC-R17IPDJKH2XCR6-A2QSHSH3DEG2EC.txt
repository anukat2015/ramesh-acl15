Title: Great Camera
Content:
So far I have had no problems with this camera.  It takes really sharp pictures and it's really easy to use.  I would recommend getting an image stabilization lens after seeing what my friend's lens can do.  I chose this camera over the Sony A100 after a long debate between the two.  I tested both out in a store and I just like the overall feel of the Canon.  I plan on getting an image stabilization lens though, so if you want a camera with image stabilization for less money, go with the Sony.  I still think the Canon is a better camera though.  Good Luck!

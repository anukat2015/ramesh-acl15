Title: Super, My favorite of them all!
Content:
I just got the new 4th gen nano for Christmas, and so far it works great. Plays and charges on my Sony Stereo System, and fits into my Aux cable in my car. The features are great, but a little cheesy on the shake to switch the song part. I love the new weight also, its so light you dont even know your holding it. And with the compatibility to play videos is another great feature, they come on crystal clear. The only thing I find annoying is that I have to "eject" the ipod before disconnecting, im not sure if that screws up the Ipod if you just disconnect it. But otherwise this is a great product.

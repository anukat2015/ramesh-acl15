Title: Great Prosumer Camera
Content:
I'm not a pro, but just someone who loves photography.
I was looking to reenter the world of photography after a 20+ year absence, last shooting with a 35mm. After reading all the "professional" reviews and the consumer reviews, I was starting to drive myself crazy! Canon? Nikon? High end? Low end? It got to the point where I realized I over-researched and my poor brain was fried. So I just decided to pull the trigger on the D90. 
Now, to be honest I had to return the first one because the flash broke almost immediately (it wouldn't stay closed) and I was getting the infamous lens error message. So I started to second guess my decision. I returned it to Amazon (which took forever, probably because it was over the holidays) and I didn't have my camera for Christmas, which was disappointing. But Amazon eventually got their act together and sent me a brand new camera after I returned the first one. And guess what? I got the lens error message during my first shoot! Amazingly frustrating to say the least. But I reset the camera and haven't had an issue since.
I've shot around 2000 photos at this point and am thrilled to death with this camera. I love the quality of the photos and I love the amazing amount of options and control that you have. I have a MAC, so I do my post production in Aperture and am having a blast! Despite the initial problems, I truly couldn't be happier and hope to have this camera for a very long time. 
My honest suggestion is pull the trigger, buy the camera, and go out and start shooting as you learn about all its features. You won't regret it. It's a joy to have and own, and everyday I just want to go out and shoot more and more pictures! So much fun!

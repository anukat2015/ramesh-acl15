Title: An excellent DSLR Camera for the money
Content:
Be honest, how many people do print on images at the size A3?  Great value for money. Easy to use. Perfect handling. Bright images. Good build. Neat in clean images. You don't need more Mb.
Well, this lens is very light and versatile and also quite sharp stopped down, The standard lens 18/70mm is average. But goes futher than other standard lenses. but no match for the Tamron 17-50 f/ 2.8 or Tamron 28-75 f/ 2.8 or the Minolta 50mm very Good.
Problems
Sony Lenses are very expensive.

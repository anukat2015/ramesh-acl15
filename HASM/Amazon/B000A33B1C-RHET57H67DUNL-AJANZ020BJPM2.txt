Title: Fades quickly!
Content:
This product worked great for about six weeks.  I bought two at the same time for our house.  One of them just stopped working.  The other lasted until the next season.  We live in Texas, so a "season" is really about eight weeks of use, at most.  After about nine to ten weeks of TOTAL use (we only had them on for about four hours a day, in the evening), the other stopped working.  These heaters were never mistreated and they were stored indoors.  Now we have two heaters that look brand new and generate zero heat.  Very disappointing.

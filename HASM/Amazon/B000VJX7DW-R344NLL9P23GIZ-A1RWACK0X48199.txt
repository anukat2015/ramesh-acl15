Title: nikon d300
Content:
i am very happy with the camera. i previously owned the d200 so this was an upgrade. the d300 is very similar in physical appearence although the features are much improved. the only problem i had was that the vendor sent me a unit that was not brand new as the box had been opened and some things were missing. Amazon was very responsive with an exchange or a refund or keeping the item but with a discounted price.

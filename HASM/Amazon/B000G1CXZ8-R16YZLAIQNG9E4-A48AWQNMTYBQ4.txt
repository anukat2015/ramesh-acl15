Title: Not very intelligent control design!
Content:
Well first off, you can't beat the price.
Something that really attracted my to purchase the heater was the automatic controls. However, they are not designed / thought out very well. The biggest letdown is that every time you turn the power off, the set temperature and mode are forgotten and reset (at next power on) to 75 degrees & high power mode! so that you have to mess around each time you turn it on to set the right temperature. Switching power on and off should not effect the mode or temp. settings. There is a large red pilot light that stays on ALL THE TIME, (as long as the unit is plugged in) this seems rather stupid to me, I would much rather have an indication of power (On/Off) state of the unit so that I know that it will come on in auto mode when necessary. For some reason the controls are designed so that the LCD back light goes off after a delay without pressing buttons, so that's not an indicator of power on state ether and leaving it on would make reading the LCD much easier. (It's not like you need to save battery power or anything)  A little creativity in the engineering department would have gone a long way! 
All that said, the heater does heat the room well. and make the electric meter go-round. If the control functionality (or lack of) doesn't bother you, I would recommend this otherwise good product. If things like the control operation might annoy you, be careful!

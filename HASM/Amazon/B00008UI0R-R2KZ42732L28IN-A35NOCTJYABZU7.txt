Title: horror story
Content:
bought Hoover S3765-040 2 years ago & it is only used 1x a month.  rubber band keeps falling off Carpet & Floor Power Nozzle - the main part for vacuming floor/carpets.  was going to order replacement part for $70 but was sent replacement band gratis (normally about $5)    worked for a couple of months.  warranty date passed.  repair locations are no where near where live so why pay $25 to ship it when it may not work. replacement power nozzle that was $70 is now $149.   the entire vacuum only costs about $170.   I MUST HAVE GOTTEN THE LEMON.

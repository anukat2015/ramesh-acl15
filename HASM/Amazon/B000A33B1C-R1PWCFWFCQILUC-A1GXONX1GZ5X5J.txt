Title: Amazing heat output
Content:
Recently bought because our furnace went out.  This is able to keep our house super warm, maybe even too warm.
Pros:
- Great coverage (1000 sq ft easy)
- Adjustable current draw
- Wheels
Cons:
- Bad instruction manual (hard to figure out to get to a maintain state)
- Timer functionality is a pain without tweezers
If you want a space heater, this one is just a great buy!

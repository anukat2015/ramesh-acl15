Title: Miserable
Content:
This is a very well marketed device, but poorly designed.  It does not vacuum well, even on laminate floors.  Now that I tried it, the hair bar in front serves no purpose, every once in a while, you have to flip it up and clean it.  Well, it's pretty easy to clean with the vacuum, so why bother!  Just vacuum the hair.  The dust does not stay in the bin.

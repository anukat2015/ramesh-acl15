Title: Love the Toshiba l505-gs6000
Content:
I purchased the gs6000 last weekend.  The salesperson recommended the Toshiba gs6000 with the AMD processor over the computer I was going to purchase with the Intel processor.  That left me confused since I had not heard of the AMD processor.  I went home and did some research on AMD processors.  The AMD won hands down in almost all reviews I read, excelling in graphics. So far, I love the Toshiba. It's very quiet. The touch pad was scrolling at times, which I thought was not working correctly until my step daughter got on it and informed me the right side of the touch pad was made to scroll!  I have always owned a Dell.  One thing I really like about the Toshiba is that the fan vent is on the side, keeping the bottom much cooler than my old Dell where the fan was on the bottom.  The only complaint I would have is the keys are not concave, which I am used to.  Just a preference.  I mainly use it for photography.  So far, it's great!

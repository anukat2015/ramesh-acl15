Title: The worst computer I've ever owned
Content:
I have to type fast... it blue screened while I was typing this review!  Maybe it knows I'm talking about it!  LOL  Seriously, I've had issues since day one... and the blue screen is a daily occurance.  I've spoken with Dell support over 40 times, put in a new mother board, lost all my data seven times now, and had to reinstall a total of nine times.  I've been promised a call back from a Dell rep 28 times (I started keeping track when it went from ridiculous to just plain comical)... number of callbacks?? Zero.  They won't take the computer back and I was told by Dell that they have had issues with Vista that has caused some "minor" trouble.  Would you call the above "minor"??  Seriously though, please, please, PLEASE take this review to heart.  I've had this computer for a little over a year now and have never experienced such a nightmare.  I'm not dramatic, or easily ticked off, and tend to take things in stride.  I am to the point now where I look forward to the day I can take a sledge hammer to this one and then send it back.  The evil must be returned to it's Maker!  LOL  Ok... no more jokes.  My old computer was a Sony Vaio that I gave to my mother.  It's eight years old, she uses it daily, and it's crashed, oh, maybeee.... well, it never has.  I'm absolutely disgusted with Dell... I have a friend who bought four computers for her kids... she bought the exact model I have and it's two months old and doing the same thing.  In addition, I bought a Dell flat screen TV (30 inch) and have to turn it off and on seven to eight times just to get the picture to come up.  Dell makes a good doorstop and paperweight, if you are looking for more than that, prepare to get mad!

Title: Retro Lenses Get a New Lease on Life
Content:
The express purpose of my purchase of the G1 was to have a platform from which to photograph using my extensive kit of vintage and manual glass.  The G1 is an outstanding body for just this purpose and in the first week of having it, I was able to use every one of the lenses I favor.  This includes the Canon 100/2, the Canon 0.95 "Dream Lens", a Summicron-R mount, a Cooke, Taylor, Hobson Large format, a Celestron C-8 telescope, and a Questar 3.5" telescope to name a few.
The controls are nicely placed and, once familiar with that placement, easy to access.  Often criticized in other reviews, the function knob is easy to find and use in the dark.  Only real issue to me is that I would have liked it to be a bit stiffer on the click stops as it is easy to bump and change the settings.
I really like this body.

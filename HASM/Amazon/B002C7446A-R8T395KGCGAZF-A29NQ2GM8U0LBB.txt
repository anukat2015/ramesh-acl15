Title: Finally able to leave my PowerBook behind . . .
Content:
I've never loved another computer like I have my 12" Powerbook G4--and I swore I wouldn't replace it until Apple released another 12". During the last few years, as my beloved laptop began showing signs of wear( I must have dropped it ten times...) and it began falling behind in technology -- I did attempt -- twice -- to replace it. First with a 15" MacBook Pro, then with one of those black 13" MacBooks when they first came out. The 15" was just too heavy and ran too hot -- sold it. (Although I hear the new 15" Pro model is lighter and runs cooler...) That black previous-gen 13" MacBook was too plastic-y and I just hated the keyboard and screen. Sold that one too. I figured I'd better make the PowerBook last, it was going to be a long wait...
Then, Apple released the 13" as a "Pro" model with the longer-lasting battery and improved screen, and a few other little tweaks (like a lighted keyboard), and I figured my wait was up. I jumped in, prepared to sell another one, if I had to.
This Mac's a keeper. I didn't think they could do it, but Apple has created a light, sleek laptop with a small footprint and just enough screen real estate to work comfortably. I love the new keyboard -- I didn't think they could create a touch like they had with the PowerBook, but this one "just works," and I got used to the larger trackpad very quickly. As usual with Apple products, everything they design just makes sense. 
I've been using this fantastic machine non-stop now for a month, and I love it. PowerBook who? I can't find a thing wrong with it. It's the perfect blend of form and function, and when I don't need it on my lap, I just plug it into my keyboard, mouse, and monitor, and it's a speedy desktop workhorse. Apple deserves that best quarter ever they just had . . .

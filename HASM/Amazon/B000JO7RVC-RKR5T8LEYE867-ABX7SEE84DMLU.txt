Title: If It Isn't A Mess, It'll Do Until The Real Mess Comes Along
Content:
I never had an iPod and bought this one because...
Because I wanted the big storage capacity and did not mind the larger size.  And, unlike other reviewers, I have only had to reset it once.  What is a "mess" about it is the hegemony Apple has tried to establish over music management.
"You'll like our stuff so much you won't mind our abuse," is Apple's attitude and, so far, they've done well with it.
As much as I might resent being told that there is only one acceptable way to manage my music collection, I love this thing.  The indexing is fantastic.  I can get at whatever I want to listen to quickly, it holds so much, and it's hard not to like.
Cover flow is bogus, for sure.  So - who needs cover flow, anyway?  If you can read, you can do whatever you need with your music on this thing.
NOTE:  My rating pertains only to music and pictures.  I have no idea how this does with video.

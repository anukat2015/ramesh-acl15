Title: Canon XSi 12.2
Content:
My very first big girl camera...And I absolutely love it! I was torn between the Nikon D80 and this Canon. I went to our local Costco and tried each. The Canon is much lighter and easier to hold. . .less boxy. It takes wonderful pictures. It's perfect for me as an amateur photographer, it was easy to set up, charge and download from. What a great purchase. . .my next purchase a snappy telephoto lens!

Title: bad started
Content:
nice product have to pay 100 dollars to update it. The laptop worked really bad at the beginning. Now it works ok, im happy with it but being a Sony Vaio cant say the best product ever. the price not bad, maybe bad luck bad 1st impression is important and no satisfied with it. Probabily would like to try another brand like dell, even mac(nice but over priced)

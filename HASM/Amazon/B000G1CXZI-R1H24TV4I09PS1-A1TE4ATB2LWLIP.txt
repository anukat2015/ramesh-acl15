Title: Bang!  Pop!  Pow!
Content:
This is our 5th DeLonghi oil-filled radiator but the first (and last) of this particular model (TRN0812T).  Loved, and still do love, the other 4 DeLonghi heaters.  This one, purchased through Amazon, heats just fine but is the loudest, most obnoxious fanless heater I've ever experienced.  On every heating element on/off cycle the thermostat causes, the heater pops, pings, clicks and bangs with startling loudness.  It's far too loud for a bedroom, nursery or a room where you're trying to read or enjoy music.
My other DeLonghi heaters are almost dead silent and do a wonderful job.  This one we've banished to the far end of one wing of the house and can still hear it banging and popping three rooms away.  Yes, I noticed the other reports on Amazon from owners reporting noise from this heater but, since my other DeLonghis were so quiet, I just figured those folks were being super picky.  Not so.  They were telling it like it is.  I've checked every fitting and part on the exterior of the heater and cannot stop the noises; they are internal.  Not recommended.

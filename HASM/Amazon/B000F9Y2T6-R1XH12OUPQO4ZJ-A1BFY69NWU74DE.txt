Title: Had a floor mate, this sucks better
Content:
my  floor mate wouldn't switch back to wet/dry exactly 93 days after purchase. ( 3 days after warranty expired) this one does suck much better, it even pulls the vinyl up a bit.  (don't have any wood floors) I've only had it about a month but so far so good!  Anything to get off my knees.

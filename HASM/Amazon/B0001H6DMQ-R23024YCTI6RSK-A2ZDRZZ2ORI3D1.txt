Title: Electrical Connection btw Hose and Motor Breaks - recall warranted
Content:
Yes, it's true.  After 3 months the electrical connection (inside of the hose) from the controls in the wand handle to the motor in the rug beater - developed a break in the wire.  I should have used the warranty but found a way to twist the hose so that a connection is achieved.  You know, it's really too bad Hoover just doesn't own up and do a recall - Hoover is a great brand and this model COULD HAVE been a great buy.  NO.  Don't buy one.

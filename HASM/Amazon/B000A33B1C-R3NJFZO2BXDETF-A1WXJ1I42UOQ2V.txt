Title: Reduced Gas Consumption
Content:
I purchased this heater to use in an open space kitchen/dining/living room.  The temperature outside had been below freezing for a several days mixed with some snow.  We have a gas fireplace that we wanted to use less because of $4.00+ per gallon propane prices. I placed this heater on the opposite end of the room far away from the gas heater and turned on high.  Our gas heater didn't come on a single time that day.  Heat is immediate and consistent.  I am very satisfied and would purchase this heater again if necessary.  I didn't notice strong odors as others mentioned, maybe because of the the open space it was used in.  I also like the fact that this type heater is supposed to be one of the safest on the market.  I haven't received the electric bill yet so I'm not sure how much it cost to operate vs. gas  but will update with cost later.

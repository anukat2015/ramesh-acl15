Title: Not bad portable cooler...
Content:
It helps a bit... I mostly used it at night and the tank was enough to last all night (I usually sleep 6 or 7 hrs). It has good options like timer, 3 speeds and a remote control...
Be careful where you place it... need to place it for the best result near a window... if you place the cooler on a closed room it will not cool, will just make the room humid...
Not bad to sleep, not that good for the day...

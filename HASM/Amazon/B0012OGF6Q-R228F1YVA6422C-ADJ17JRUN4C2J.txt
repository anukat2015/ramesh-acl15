Title: Great Camera!
Content:
Switching from a Cannon Powershot A95 point and shoot to a SLR Camera was a huge jump. When I first got it I was a little intimidated. Surprisingly I found it very easy to operate and I was out taking pictures that same day with the automatic setting of course. Now after a few weeks, I have gone through the manual and have become a lot more comfortable with the manual settings. I highly recommend buying at a minimum the Nikon ss-600 flash which is what I got. The pictures come out incredible and professional like. I am sure once I have more practice my pictures will be just as good as a Studio. At least that is the goal and with this camera and it's simple to understand functions, I am sure I will get there. I also bought the AF-S Nikon Nikkor 55-200mm Zoom lens as the lens that comes with the camera is limited on close ups. All three of these items including a 4 year protection, 8GB Card, Two extra batteries, Bag, cleaning kit and car charger where all bought via Amazon and Cameta Cameras which is an Amazon Retailer. Huge savings!  Bought everything for around $1050. Compared to Best Buy where just the camera, protection plan, flash and extra lens was over $1300. If I would of bought everything at a local retailer like Best Buy, I would of spent almost $1700. Wow!

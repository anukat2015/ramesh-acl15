Title: Great computer, but with scratches
Content:
As the title says, the computer is great, it is much more than I expected considering I moved from PC platform to Mac. Every thing just works fine, no bugs, no hassles. This Macbook Pro is a 2008 model, but I found it very powerful and fast compared to my Vaio FZ-180e.
The only annoyance had nothing to do with the laptop conception or functionality: it came with scratches on the right side of the lid. Also, when I installed aditional memory I found a lot of dust inside it, which made me wonder that this notebook could have been in some showcase at Datavision Computer Video store in NY, from where it was delivered.
I've tried to contact the store by e-mail through the proper service at Amazon's site, but received no word about it. And since I'm not in the US right now, I just got stuck with a new computer that looks old. So, the reason I rate it no so good is due to its handling by the store, not because the quality of the equipment which I think it is superb.

Title: Research First !
Content:
i highly suggest anyone considering purchasing one of these units do their research first. I have run across several negative reviews.
my parents just purchased the model 1000 afew weeks ago.
i noticed in a quiet room, the unit can be heard from 15ft away.
a fan forces very hot air from a vent in the front, and it DOES affect room humidity unlike the advertising.

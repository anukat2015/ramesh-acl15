Title: Not bad..  Better than a CD player..
Content:
This is my first iPod Nano and I bought it at Fred Meyer.  The device is great but the iTunes program is not.  Apple seems to be under the impression that no one has their music downloaded on the computer before installing iTunes.  Instead of importing directly from what's already on the computer, they ask for the cd's for importing the music so in effect, I now have two music libraries: Windows Media Player 11 and now iTunes!  And half of my favorites are on WMP and cannot be transferred to iTunes because they are incompatible!
As for the iPod itself, it's very user friendly and easy to use.  The loud volume comes in handy for a hearing impaired individual!  I have no problem plugging the iPod into the computer via a USB cable.  Actually, it seems smart because of the sheer number of people who own either a computer and/or an iPod.  The USB cable is enclosed in the new Nanos and is reasonably priced at around $19.99 at most stores.

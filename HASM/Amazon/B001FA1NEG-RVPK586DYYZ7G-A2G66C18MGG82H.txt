Title: Going back to Afghanistan
Content:
I purchased this for my Fiance' while he was home on Emergency leave from Afghanistan (this is his 3d MOB).  Once he returned to Salerno, he let me know that the iPod was one of the best distractors, so to speak, going!  He loved it! The musics, the games, which my 12 yr old discovered for me before he left, and the ability for the movies.  A fantastic companion for long trips, and idle hours.  :)  Thanks so!!!

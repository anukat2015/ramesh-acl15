Title: Hidden costs - can become a nightmare
Content:
If you have a problem with the unit, your life will become a nightmare.  I have tried on and off for over a year to obtain a part for my Delonghi Dehumidifier.  They do not sell parts to consumers, instead trying to get you to mail the heavy device to one of their repair centers usually very far away.  Third-party parts people I have spoken with were specifically banned from selling the part to consumers, though Delonghi officially claims this isn't so.  All in all, I think I have wasted over a day of my life trying to get a small, simple replacement part for my unit.  I will never purchase a Delonghi product again.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand.

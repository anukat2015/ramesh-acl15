Title: Brews excellent coffee with minimal hassle or problems...
Content:
Here's the good:
1.  Hot coffee
2.  Full flavor
3.  Carafe is sturdy, durable, and easy to handle
4.  Carafe rarely spills coffee because of a well designed lid
5.  Customizable beeps to let you know when the coffee is done and when it's shutting itself down
6.  3 setting (low, medium, hight) hotplate temperature setting
7.  Of course one should always read the manual, you can program it quite quickly with minimal learning curve using the intuitive knobs, buttons, and the switch.
8.  The flip-switch is wonderful and is centrally located for ease of use.
9.  Overall ease of use
Here's the bad:  (you can decide if it's a small or major problem)
1.  Small area to pour water in
2.  Still have to make sure the gold filter is clean.  (but then again, why would you want to make coffee with a dirty filter?)
3.  Time/LCD display is difficult to see if you're looking at it from a standing position and it's not backlit or anything.
4.  There are faster brewers out there and there are slower brewers too.  I put this in the middle.  
Hope this helps.  Overall, I am very pleased with this unit and it looks pretty sharp too.

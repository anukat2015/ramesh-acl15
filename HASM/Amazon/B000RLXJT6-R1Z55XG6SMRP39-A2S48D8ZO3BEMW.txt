Title: WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
Content:
I want to start out by saying that I am not someone who writes reviews but this was sooo ridiculous I felt I should warn other people before they make the same mistake.  I was very surprised that other people had not complained about this product.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!  I live in a building so I too was required to get rid of my window air conditioner which worked fine by the way. From the time I purchased this machine I had problems.  The first one I had malfunctioned and did not turn off when the water bucket was full like it was suppose to and show the water bucket symbol so the water ended up overflowing on the floor.  It leaked from everywhere not just out of the water tap sometimes even when the water plug was in the machine.  The new one I got also gushed water perfusly, like a reservoir like a previous reviewer said is no understatement.  The machine does cool off the room but it is a large hassel to have to empty out this water from the nozzle every few hours.  The mini cookie pan is not enough to hold the water and I had to transfer the water to a second bucket before emptying it out which I had to watch constantly. I am too afraid to let the water build up and have what happened the first time happen again.  If you are willing to empty this water ALL DAY LONG you could buy this machine, otherwise look for a better product.

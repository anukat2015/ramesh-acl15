Title: Best vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
Light weight, super easy to use and great suction.  My last vacuum was an Orek upright and I thought it was the best until I used this one.  I'm very happy with it and it was a great value.
P.S. I have 3 dogs ranging in size from 9lbs. to 120lbs. and dog hair is not an issue for this vacuum.

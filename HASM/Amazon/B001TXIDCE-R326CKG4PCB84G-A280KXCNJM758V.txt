Title: DON"T BUY IT
Content:
I upgraded to E-620 from E-510 and was a mistake. I returned the camera for a refund. If you're a first time Olympus user you may be satisfied but for 510 users, you will not. E-510 is a very exceptional camera for its class and other classes of Olympus as well. It offers exceptional details and sharpness. The E-620 details are smeared up and has some serious focusing issues, focusing is inconsistent - sometimes sharp other times are not. The noise is overwhelming, images are as noisy as point and shoot cameras. Auto-ISO starts at 200 which is noisy even in bright weather condition. if you want to shoot at 100 you have to set it up manually each time you take a picture. Don't be fooled with the "Auto Gradation" feature, using it causes shadows to brighten and as a result big batches of colored noise appear even at ISO 100. E-620 has good color rendition and good dynamic range though. My E-510 is my last Olympus and Four thirds system camera, I lost faith in them.

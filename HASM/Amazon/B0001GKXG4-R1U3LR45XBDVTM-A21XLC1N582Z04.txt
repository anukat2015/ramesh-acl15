Title: Not a good choice for a garage
Content:
Claims of 19,000 BTU are greatly exaggerated. My garage is 400 sq ft and has 240v service. A $40 Home Depot heater does almost as good a job. Two $40 Home Depot heaters do a much better job than the L5600. This heater would probably do 150 sq ft easily. 200+ sq ft might be a stretch if it's in a cold area. I'm surprised Dayton would put their name on this heater.

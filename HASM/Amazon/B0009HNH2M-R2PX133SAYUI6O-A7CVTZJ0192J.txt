Title: Good little vacuum
Content:
We have been using this vacuum almost for two years now and it is still going strong.It is kind of bulky compared to Bosch branded ones but still small enough to hide in a small storage.
Pros:
-Reasonably priced for its quality and power
-Durable, no problems so far
-Has a power brush that is very useful on carpet
-Has a light on the sucking head, which is rarely useful when vacuuming a dark area (e.g. under the bed or couch)
Cons:
-Not easy to find the bags for it. I never saw it in nearby supermarkets so I am always ordering online (online is cheaper anyway, however you have to order in advance)
-It is a little bit on the noisy side especially when you turn on the power brush.
-The sucking head is kind of big, so not very easy to use on narrow spots or maneuver around the legs of your furniture.
Summary:
-I recommend this vacuum to anyone. There are certainly better canister vacuums (I liked the higher priced Bosch ones better) but I don't think they worth the price difference. This is the best value.

Title: Nikon D50
Content:
Step up to Nikon. Worth every penny, I searched long and hard trying to decide which camera to buy. Forget about it! just buy Nikon, every lens that Nikon has ever made will work on all thier cameras. Canon, Minolta, Pentax, NO you don't want any of these. Any "real" photographer will tell you Nikon is the best, and it helps that they also make the best optics in the business!

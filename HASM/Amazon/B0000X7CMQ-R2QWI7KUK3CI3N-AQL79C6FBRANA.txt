Title: Great coffee pot
Content:
I've been looking for a good thermal carafe coffee pot that actually keeps the coffee warm.  I bought a Capreso about a year ago and while it brewed a good cup of coffee, by the time I got to my third cup, the carafe had already cooled off to the point that my cup was just warm and I'd have to heat it in the microwave to get it up to drinking temperature.  I figured after spending $189 for it, I'd live with the reheating.  However, after a year of normal use, it stopped brewing.  I'd turn it on and about all it did was spit steam.
I just bought a Zojirushi which arrived today and have brewed my first pot of coffee.  The coffee is fantastic.  The carafe actually keeps it warm.  So far so good.  Great coffee maker at half the price I paid for the last piece of junk.

Title: Mixed feelings from a coffee fanatic
Content:
Coffee is serious biz at our house, we roast our own beans and carefully test and select varietals. After careful research regarding the optimal temperature and methods of brewing we selected this machine. It almost got returned the next day when the grinder downstairs in the kitchen echoed off the walls upstairs like a friggin jet plane winding up for take-off. The lack of an adjustable grind setting means you are stuck with the pre-set grind. Everyones taste is different and a coarser grind makes a weaker pot, but too fine a grind can make it bitter, so what happens if you dont like the pre-set grind? Luckily we can compensate by adding more beans than usual but grind control would be nice. Also, we have used this machine for about two months and the control panel seemed dead the other morning, fine yesterday, then dead again this morning - had to unplug to reset, then works fine, but still cause for concern.
Water temp is fine, right around the optimal 200 degrees, carafe design is smart (no burner to continue to cook the coffee)and keeps coffee for hours. Clean up is not hard unless you are inpatient, honestly if you quibble over having to clean a pot then go buy your morning cup. 
Bottom line - it does what it is supposed to do very well (all in one coffee brewer), but there are some ancillary issues that would really help make this worth what they charge for it.
If I spend that kind of money on the convenience of a drip brewer I'll go with a far superior Technivorm, otherwise I'll go with a much cheaper french press which gives more control and outstanding results but sadly no timer.  
~Good luck

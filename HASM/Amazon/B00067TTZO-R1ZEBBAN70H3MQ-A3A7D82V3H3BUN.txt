Title: Excellent
Content:
(+=pro, -=con)
-(+)I bought the Zen Micro in May of 2005. The first thing I noticed was how small it is. I was thinking of it being the macho IPOD size which is clunky, and innefective if trying to use with one hand. It fits easily in the palm of your hand and is fun to show off how small it is.
-(+)I also thought that the look was very cool. The blue LED light around the edge really makes a difference from many other mp3s.
-(+&-)The installed FM radio is a plus, but the quality and reception is poor.
-(-)Battery life is so-so. It depends mostly on how many times you light the screen (by touching the pad, this can be disabled to save battery life). For me, it only lasts about 5 hours, but that is because I leave the backlight on and I change the songs often.
-(+)Sound quality is excellent when listening through earphones. Does not sound as good when connected to speakers because you can hear the compact sound, but this is the same with all mp3's.
-(-)The touch pad is very sensitive, and is not user-friendly, but I was able to manage it after the first hour. I do not like touch pads; I prefer buttons, and a scroll, but it does not make much of a difference. In my opinion, the layout of the touch pad is poor, but it does not take back from the quality of the player.
-(+)The removable battery is a huge plus, compared to those who cant be removed, such as the IPOD. When the battery life becomes shorter and shorter, you can buy a new one. It also provides a way to listen to more music; if you have two batteries, you can just replace the one that has run out of life with a full-charged battery. You can listen to twice the amount of music in a sitting. 
-(+)The USB port makes it very simple to connect and quickly transfer songs to your computer.
-(-)The rounded shape, in my opinion, makes it look very "unprofessional". I would rather have gotten something like the IRiver that has a boxy, professional-like (sorry for the repetion) look to it. But again, this does not take back from the overall value of the player.
-(-)The back of the player is easily scratched-up. I bought a leather RhinoSkin cover which has helped. I reccomend that you do this if you get the Zen Micro.
A month ago, the jack began to become loose, and I have to adjust the headphone jack frequently (it is not the headphones, I have tested with many). I am going to send it in for repair after Christmas break. Although this definately took away from my overall veiw of the Zen, I expected that this would happen if I used a mp3 in general for half a year.
Overall this mp3 is a must get for those who enjoy having something unique, and different from the ordinary. In my experience, it is much better than the IPOD, and is one of the best players out there.

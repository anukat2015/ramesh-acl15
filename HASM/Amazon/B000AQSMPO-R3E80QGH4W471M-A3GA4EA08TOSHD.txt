Title: good but could be better, still my choice
Content:
This Keurig machine has been with us now for about 5 months, and it's so nice to have a cup-by-cup maker in the kitchen!
Here are my pros and cons on this purchase:
Pro
- Convenience
- Speed (fast warm up, fast brewing)
- Wide and economic availability of K cups
- Not too big for our cramped kitchen counter
Cons
- Sounds like the Queen Mary in a fog bank when it starts up(pump is like a fog horn)
- When finished it wheezes like my Uncle Herb when he finally gets stuck with a restaurant tab
- Coffees are a tad on the bitter side (I have started using half-and-half again)
- That water reservoir is a b*&^h! Better get a simple glass pitcher to refill it, or your counter will be awash in spillage as you try to seat the d#$%&d thing, topped off with water.
But it's still the best choice out there. Shop around, places like Bad and Bath have some great sales on K's and K cups. Our first one from Amazon was totally shattered by UPS, so if you get it from here, shake the package before you open it, so you can just refuse it back to UPS rather than go through a replacement ritual.

Title: Powerful laptop for business, personal, college use
Content:
Pros: 15.4" screen, light-weight, both Win XP Professional and Win Vista OS, its really hard to find laptops nowadays with Win XP. 250GB Hi Speed HDD with Gravity shock protection (imagine), Built-in Wireless,Bluetooth,Camera, Hi Speed FireWire/S400 port
Cons: I don' t think there's anything bad with this laptop. If it were up to me, I'd make the whole world buy this laptop.
Summary: I like this product because first of all you are getting a 2.53 GHz intel centrino 2, core 2 duo processor with FSB 1066MHz, and a 3GB RAM (speed of RAM is 800MHz). Then you have a perfect size 15.4" screen, with max resolution 1440*900. Then you have a 250GB SATA 5400 rpm HDD with gravity shock protection. All power to Sony for that. For networking you have built-on Wireless, built-in bluetooth therefore good bye cables and clutter.For webcam, you have a built-in camera as well. The keyboard is a typing bliss, I wish I had a typing job. Its ergonomic and it feels so good on fingers. The laptop is very light weigh and thin. It is almost as think as it could get. Battery life is good. 5 hrs practical battery life with Wi-Fi on and bluetooth On. Then it has a finger print reader. Wow. On top of it, Win XP Professional and Win Vista, both option. Also, the casing and keyboard is spill resistant, so if you drop tea or coffee on the keyboard you do not have to worry about anything, you just turn the power off and invert the laptop. I think this is by far the best laptop I have used and one could buy. Thanks.

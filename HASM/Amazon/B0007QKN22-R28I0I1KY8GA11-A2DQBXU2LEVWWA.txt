Title: low end, but great SLR
Content:
This camera doesn't come with a memory card... I guess I didn't realize that before buying it.  Otherwise I might not have thought this was such a great deal.  Look into their XTi.  I'm pretty sure the shutter speed is significantly faster. Also do research on lenses you might want before you buy.  There are some kits that might come with more than one lens.

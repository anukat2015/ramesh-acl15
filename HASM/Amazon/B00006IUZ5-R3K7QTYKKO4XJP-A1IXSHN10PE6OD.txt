Title: Sunbeam Hot Shot
Content:
I've owned a Hot Shot since 1982. Excellent product. Heats up to two cups of water very fast. Puts microwave to shame. The only thing you have to watch is that the heating element can burn out if you don't have water in the Hot Shot. So, if you only plug it in when you want to use it, I recommend having the water in before you do that. Sometimes, you hit the "heat" button in the course of working around it, so the "heat" light will come on as soon as you plug it in. If so, unplug immediately, add water and re-plug. Other than that, they last forever.

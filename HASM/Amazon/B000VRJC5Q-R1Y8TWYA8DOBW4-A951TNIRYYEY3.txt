Title: Sony Alpha A700 Digital SLR Camera
Content:
The Sony A700 is a sister camera to the Konica-Minolta Maxxum 7D which I own and was very pleased with.  I purchased the Sony based on my experience with the Maxxum 7D.  I am currently traveling nationwide and using both cameras to photograph my travel.  I have found the Sony to be as good of a camera that I have ever used,  is easy to use,  very fast under low light conditions and all lenses from the Maxxum 7D are interchangeable with the A700.  The pictures are crystal sharp.  The ISO is adjustable in excess of 3200 for night shooting. This camera is equal to the Nikon and Canon series class.  I strongly recommend consideration for purchase,  the Sony A700 Digital SLR.
Thank you,

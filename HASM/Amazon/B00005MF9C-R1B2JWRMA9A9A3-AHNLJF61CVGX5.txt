Title: Good taste, economical and efficient
Content:
I am very pleased with the ease and efficiency of this one-cup coffee maker, but would agree with other reviewers who suggest using Melitta #1 cone filters instead of the permanent one provided.  I hate to have to suggest using a throw-away component, but made more than a dozen cups without being able to get used to the excessive amount of sludge in the coffee.  With the disposable filters, this is fantastic alternative to the "pod" one-cup systems.  I had been given the Black & Decker Home Cafe, which costs more than twice what the Brew & Go costs, but returned it because I couldn't imagine being tied down to pods and never being able to brew coffee from any other form of packaging.  This one is very economical given the good coffee it makes and the extremely low price.

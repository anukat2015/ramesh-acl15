Title: Saved us some money
Content:
Let's not be naive here - electrical heaters are going to cost money to operate, and one of these little heaters is not going to heat a 2,000 sq. foot home.  However, we got four of these last winter and spent substantially less on heating our home than we used to with propane.  Propane prices were getting pretty bad, and we had a year around plan where we spent the same amount on propane each month.  Now that we don't use propane for heating anymore, we've been able to lower our monthly payments to nearly nothing (we still use propane for heating our water and drying our clothes).  In the coldest winter months, we spend slightly more on electricity+propane per month than we used to, but we spend so much less the rest of the year that we've already saved hundreds of dollars in just the past year.
If you're getting sick of high fuel expenses for heating, these are worth a try.  They paid for themselves in less than a year for us, and have been saving us money ever since.

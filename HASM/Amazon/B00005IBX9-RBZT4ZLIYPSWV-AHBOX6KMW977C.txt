Title: Good coffee maker
Content:
I've had this coffee maker over 5 years.  Still works great.  
Pros:
- Durable.  I read several reviews of name brand coffee makers that quit after a year or two. (In fact, I had one of them prior to this one.)
- Makes coffee quickly
- Makes good coffee
- 1-4 cup switch is nice.
- The metal filter is handy - no need to buy filters.  You can also can use paper, however.
Cons:
- Needs an external site glass so you don't have to measure the water in the carafe
- Hard to find the water filters
- Top of carafe should be hinged.  Instead it snaps in and out - not as handy/quick as a hinge.

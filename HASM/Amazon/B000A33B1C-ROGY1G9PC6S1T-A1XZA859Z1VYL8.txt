Title: good heater but noisy
Content:
This heater works good, but it generates low-pitch noise constantly at power setting 2 and 3 (but at power setting 1, no noise at all), this noise will drive you crazy at night time if you use it in the bedroom.
Not sure if the heater I got is a defective one, just filled the form and requested a replacement, hopefully the new one won't have this problem.
I saw reviews saying that timer can cause noise, but this noise is not coming from the timer and I have no problem with the timer noise at all.

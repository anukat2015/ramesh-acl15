Title: what, no error messages?
Content:
2 years ago I bought a very expensive HP with windows xp.  Nothing but trouble from day one.  Error after error.  Then one day it would work perfectly and the next it would be worthless.  My new Sony Vaio, cheaper than the HP, with Windows 7 has been great.  I'm not a computer wiz so the fact I got my wireless network and printer set up with this without ANY trouble is amazing.  Thanks to Sony for always producing reliable products...I have a walkman from the mid 80's that's still running!

Title: hard to beat
Content:
with a full frame sensor that offers top of class, low noise hi ISO image quality, this camera is hard to beat.  to do so you will spend at least twice as much for very modest improvements in IQ by going to 20+ MP sensor.  do you need that? I don't.  This is a real still photographers camera.  if you want video, then sure the canon eos 5d mark II will give you that with some limits, and without nearly as robust a focusing system.  This camera is the camera i have been waiting for for years, and after having it in my hands for 9 months now, I havent had a single regret.  awesome.

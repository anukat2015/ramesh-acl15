Title: Do not buy an HP laptop
Content:
I bought 2 HP laptops and have had nothing but trouble.  1 laptop had to go back to the shop three times:  once because the bracket connecting the screen to the keyboard broke, once because the hard drive was defective and once because the sound card was defective.  One time I sent it to HP and they returned my computer still broken.  My other laptop had to be returned to the factory because the hard drive was defective.  I have had to do so many system restores (and in fact did one last night) and lost programs that I had to buy (Word Perfect).  Even though it was supposed to have been repaired, my itunes library still doesn't play right.  The music will skip.  This computer is a huge disappointment.  I don't even use the computer anymore because it is so annoying. Vista makes it even worse (although I think hp finally realized this.)

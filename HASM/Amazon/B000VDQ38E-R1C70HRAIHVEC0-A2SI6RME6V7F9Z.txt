Title: the best ever!!!!!!
Content:
I purchased this vaccum hoping that it would make my rugs much better since at the time I had to literally place sheets over my rugs of embarrasing pet hair. My other one just wasn't doing it. I even borrowed the woman's one across the street and it picked up some of the pet hair and that was maybe vaccuming after 15 minutes. The moment I open my new pet hair remover vaccum I was amazed at what it did. In about one minute my rug was all free of pet hair and my rug was looking new again. I threw the sheets out that once covered my rug and now my pets can lay on the rug and I can clean it with little or no ease at all. This machine is wonderful for any pet owner. I would recommend it to anyone with pets. it also works great on my sofa....

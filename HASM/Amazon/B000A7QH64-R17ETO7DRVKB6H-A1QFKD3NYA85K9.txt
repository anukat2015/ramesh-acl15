Title: Poor battery life
Content:
I had the virtually identical, earlier version of the vac and it was great... power and long battery life. Finally, the batteries died and I removed them for recycling. The batteries were substantial.  I ordered a new unit and it seemed identical but lighter... something is different. I believe  the battery pack is much smaller and hence, the shorter run time. I tried the battery maintenance tips but they didn't really help. I just believe the battery pack is inadequate for more than a few minutes of run time. Too bad this "update" is inferior to the original, but looks identical. Time to look for another brand.

Title: I prefer iPod Classic over iPod Touch
Content:
The iPod Touch has some cool Apps, but insufficient Hard Drive space. Apple is trying to hold out on its customers.
My Classic 7th Generation could improve on the screen size, but apart from that, it is absolutely perfect. i have tons of music videos, dozens of 2hr lectures, documentaries, movies, & photos. 
I could never hold that much data on the Touch.

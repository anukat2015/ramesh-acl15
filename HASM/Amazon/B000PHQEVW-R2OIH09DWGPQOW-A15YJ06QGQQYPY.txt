Title: Great little MP3 Player
Content:
I got this after doing some research on small, flash-based mp3 players that I could go jogging with. I have a 30gb iPod but was concerned with all the bouncing it did while I ran. These zen stones got good reviews. So far, it's great. It charged up faster than I expected and all I did was drop files into a "Music" folder. While it is disappointing that it does not support OGG format, I expected it from reading the specs. Also works flawlessly with Ubuntu. The color of the player is much better than in the picture. It really is a cute lime green, not so much a fluorescent yellow color as depicted.

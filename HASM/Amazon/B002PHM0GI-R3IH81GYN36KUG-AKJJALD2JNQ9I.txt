Title: So Far So Good
Content:
I bought this a month ago as a replacement for my 5 year old Dell B120.   
I used to hate Sony products but they have been impressing me lately with a recent spate of excellent products (namely, the Playstation 3 and a Sony dual-analog alarm clock).
This VAIO is no exception. Thankfully, Sony didnt add a ton of crapware to remove like Dell did with my last laptop. The screen is really nice and the keyboard is awesome (yes, the keyboard).   Theres plenty of storage and memory to handle multiple tasks and as someone who completely skipped the Vista generation, i am really liking Windows 7
2 minor complaints.  I hate the frontal location of the headphone jack and the wireless switch, which jives with my laptop stand

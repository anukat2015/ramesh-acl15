Title: Not good out of the box
Content:
The vacuum is fine on my wood floors but extremely difficult to push/pull on the carpet.  I need to turn the vacuum over (probably take it into an electrolux dealer) to see if the roller height can be adjusted at all.  The cord doesn't retract after the first use, so that will need to be looked at as well.  Am hoping that these problems can be fixed.  The design is very cool/compact, but so far I'm not happy.  However, if I can get these problems fixed then everything should be great.

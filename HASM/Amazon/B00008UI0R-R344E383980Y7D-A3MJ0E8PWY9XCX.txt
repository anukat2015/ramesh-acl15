Title: I'm learning to like this vacuum!
Content:
It has taken me a while to get used to this vacuum..a switch from a Hoover upright with attachments, but when I used it today to vacuum the stairs, I felt like it was a well designed machine.  The attachment for stair cleaning  works so well.. the length of the hose is perfect.  I'm definitely glad that I bought this vacuum.

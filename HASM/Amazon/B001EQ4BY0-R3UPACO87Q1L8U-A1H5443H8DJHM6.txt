Title: Incredible pictures, but you need to invest some time
Content:
So, I cut my teeth with 35mm SLRs, but for the last few years, I have been using prosumer level point-and-shoot cameras like the Canon G7.  Wanting something more, I bit the bullet and picked up the 50D.  To cut to the chase, the pictures from this camera are incredible--the best pics are almost 3D.  If you are looking to step up from a P&S, you will not be disappointed.  However, a couple of caveats:
1) If you can afford it, get  better lens than the kit lens.  If that's all you can afford, then save your pennies to step up to a lens.  I bought the body-only version and picked up the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras.  Yes, it cost as much as the body, but it is so worth it.  You are really not going to unlock the potential of this camera until you upgrade the lens
2) Take time to learn the camera--while you can pick up the camera, leave it in full auto mode, and get some great pics, investing a little time to learn more about the camera will pay off. I picked up  David Busch's Canon EOS 50D Guide to Digital SLR Photography, which was very helpful on this front

Title: Snazzy Player
Content:
The ZEN does what it should at a very competitive price, and the software is easy to use.  Even the video file conversion is easy to use. The SD card slot provides versatility.  You can load up the SD's with tons of MP3's, jpeg PICS, etc and have them with you.  Two GB SD's are fairly inexpensive now.  You can unplug your PC speakers from your computer,plug into your ZEN and play hours of music. This is a very good buy.

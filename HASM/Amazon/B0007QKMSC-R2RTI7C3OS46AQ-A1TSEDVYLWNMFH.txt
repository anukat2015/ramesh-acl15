Title: Fantastic Camera - Everything I expected it to be
Content:
I have been looking forward to getting a digital SLR for a long time.  This camera was everything I expected it to be, and more.  It starts up quickly and can easily take 2-3 pictures a second.  I have small children who don't tend to sit still too long, so that was a big plus for me.  The quality is awesome.  The other aspect that I'm extremely impressed with is the battery life.  There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said.  I highly recommend this camera.

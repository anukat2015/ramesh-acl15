Title: sleek computer, too bad the battery was bad TWICE.
Content:
Purchased this laptop for the battery life and memory. However, first time I received it, the battery was bad. Calls to Asus just reaffirmed that it was a battery issue- they offered to sell me a new battery, couldn't do much else for me since I purchased it on Amazon. So, I returned it and got a new replacement... with the same issue!! When I went to return this one, I was just going to ask for a refund-- but turns out that was my only option cus it said they were now 'out of stock'... which I think may mean they pulled them because there was an issue with all batteries in their current shipment. If that's the case, I never received any info from Amazon about it. So, I had to find a new laptop at a new location. Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns policy so I was able to keep the laptop that the battery didn't work on until the new laptop came a week later.
Besides the battery issue I had, it was a very nice laptop. Very sleek, I loved the look and feel of it. I ended up with a comparable Acer, that isn't nearly as attractive but was 200some dollars cheaper.

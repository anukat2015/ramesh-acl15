Title: Dualit Cordless Coffee Percolator
Content:
I really like the cordless feature of this product.  Coffee perks in a reasonable amount of time and the coffee is very palable.  The good features of this product is the reason I bought a second pot after about one year of use of the first one.  I was disappointed in the short time it took the first pot to wear out.  I had two main problems with it.  One, it leaked water out of the bottom and two, the glass part on the top broke away from the main part of the lid.  This was the only cordless percolator I could find or I would have brought another brand.

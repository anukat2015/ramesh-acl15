Title: Don' Think I Will Out Grow This One
Content:
I have had 3 or 4 $300.00 cameras and they did their job however it was time to make a jump to a real SLR digital.  The feel and controls are natural and well located, focus is fast, power-up from stand-by out standing.  I like macro floral shots, its here out of the box easy. The auto focus lens is a must, there are sellers that offer strange non-Canon lens don't go there.

Title: For mom
Content:
Bought it for my mom for x-mas. She loves it! It is a little loud, but worth it! You just click the on/off button with your foot and away you go. You cannot go fast like with a broom though keep that in mind. You have to go slower, but it does work! Gonna get her the filter refills for mom's day so she has em. Our whole house is either tile or wood flooring, 2 dogs and 2 cats and 1 parakeet. My dad likes to work in the yard when weather permits. Picks it all up!

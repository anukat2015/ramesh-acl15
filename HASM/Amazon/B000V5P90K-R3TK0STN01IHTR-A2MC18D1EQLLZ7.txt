Title: taking Photos in PA with the my 40D
Content:
[Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)]]
Well, I would had given this camera five stars, but I still think there is too much digital noise at a higher ISO despite what Canons says. The camera is fast in the sports mode. I love this feature. Also, the 3 in. screen is nice. You can navigate through all the different functions easily. The functions are similar to my rebel, so it was not hard to get moving with this model. Canon has still not mastered an easy to follow manual yet. I purchased a book and a DVD off of Amazon to help me better understands the different things you can set this camera up for. I'm still going through that.  I'm sure I'll be able to come back later and update this review, once I have more experience with my new toy. I do look forward to many year of picture taking with it.

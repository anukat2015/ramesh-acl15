Title: Best of the bunch
Content:
Been using the Vornado EH1 for a couple of months. I've tried many similar heaters and this one is the best of them. The digital thermostat actually works. I use it to heat a 20 x 23 bedroom, and it handles it well; mostly on the low setting. I need to put it on "high" when it's extra cold outside. The bedroom is on the 3rd floor and the house thermostat is on the main floor - the bedroom gets cold in winter. We use the Vornado to bring the bedroom temperature from 70 to 75 or so.
Only disapointment has been that it seems to occasionally turn itself off when no obvious safety settings have been violated. This happens only about once a week or so and is not a real problem.

Title: exceptional product
Content:
This is a great device. I use it at ballgames because of the FM radio and the fact that it fits comfortably in my pocket. The videos play well and the available storage and SD card slot means I have plenty of ways to carry my picture along to share. The ear buds have a great sound because of the X-FI technology. I have been very pleased with this and all of the products I have purchased from Creative. Creative is a very economical alternative to the I-pod.

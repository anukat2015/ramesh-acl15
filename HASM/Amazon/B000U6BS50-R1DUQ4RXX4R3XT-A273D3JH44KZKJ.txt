Title: Great Broom for anyone with pets
Content:
The Dirt Devil Rechargable is great for anyone who has pets and wood or tile floors.  I had one previously that the battery had stopped working (newer ones seem to have improved - longer battery power without having to charge in between) and really missed mine. When I swept with a regular broom the pet hair just flew around. With this vacumn it sucks up the hair and any crumbs.  Love it.

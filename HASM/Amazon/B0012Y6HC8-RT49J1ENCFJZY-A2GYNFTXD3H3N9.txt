Title: Awsome
Content:
This camera is priced well, it is small and lightweight, and it takes incredible pictures. Simple as that! Recommended highly, I've been using Canon cameras for 26 years. It is better than my AE1 Program, better than my EOS 630, and the Canon software makes your pictures be all that they can be. The price at Amazon is terrific!!! Don't forget the 8GB SD card. That price is great too, might as well buy 2 of them!  Only one problem found, if you want to call it that, my non-canon auto focus lens for my EOS 630 WILL NOT work on this camera. But the Canon auto focus lens will.
Happy Shooting

Title: iPod is the in thing for "grown-ups"! Who Knew!?
Content:
I never, at my age (let's just say "over 50"), thought about "needing" an iPod. Certainly, I enjoy music very much (my current obsession is Alpine Yodeling!), but I have my stereo and CD player and tape player and (most importantly) I have my RECORD player. Who could need anything more? Well, I discovered that you also need an iPod.  It was a birthday gift from my wife (okay let's say around mid-fifties!) I dutifully recorded all my yodel LP's into iTunes and now have yodeling 24-7 if I want (who knew there were over 1200 yodeling songs in the world?). I'm astounded by the capacity of this little machine and take it everywhere. The sound is amazing and the best thing is that I can use it anytime. I'm often "plugged in" during the night when I can't sleep and can lay in bed listening to music and NOT DISTURB MY WIFE! I can't say enough.  If you love music, get it. (If you love movies, get the 80gb. We got them got our adult children (hey, I'm not admitting to anything over mid-fifties!) and they love them.

Title: The solution for coffee spillage!
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for a few months now to use at my desk at work.  As with everyone else, I suffered from the dreaded coffee spillage issue, where it would run down the side of the carafe as you pour and get all over my desk.  I found a solution though - when you pour, rest the spout of the carafe over the lip of your cup (and don't pour too fast).  If you do this, any dribbles that cling to the underside of the spout will run down the inside of your cup instead of down the side of the carafe.  If the spout is in mid-air, I 100% of the time would get spillage.  As long as the spout is resting and hanging over the edge of the lip, I get 0% spillage.
So that fixes my #1 peeve with this thing.  My other peeve, is that it's kind of noisy.  If don't use the entire carafe up in your cup and let it stay on the hot plate, the thing makes all sorts of steamy gurgly noises, so I usually just shut it off after I pour my first cup.  Even though the carafe isn't insulated, it seems it stays hot enough so that when I freshen up my cup its still hot enough to enjoy.  I drink my coffee pretty quickly though.

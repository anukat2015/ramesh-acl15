Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
This is an awesome little vacuum. The only problem is what everyone else mentioned. The tools are attached in a STUPID spot. So they fall off. I just leave my tools off so I am not frustrated. LOL.
As far as suction, this little thing is great. I love the wind up cord too!
Great vacuum for the money! Would have rated a 5 if not for the tool attachment location.

Title: Very nice
Content:
Don't listen to people who own iPods and write reviews like the previous ones to try and convince themselves that they got the better deal. The Zune is, like I said, very nice. It's extremely easy to use, the software is good, and battery life is good. I've been playing with it all day but had to stop so that I write this review to try to dispel the previous inaccurate and flat out dumb reviews. About the size: It's the same width, 0.3" taller, and 0.15" deeper. I'm ok with that seeing how as the screen on the Zune is 20% larger. The Zune has a built in FM tuner, the iPod does NOT. The Zune has wireless capabilities, the iPod does NOT. The ONLY thing the iPod has that I wish the Zune had is the scroll wheel. There aren't too many accessories out there for it yet, but once word gets around that it's a lot better than the iPod there will be a lot more and they'll be a lot easier to find. So don't listen to these bitter people who have recently spent the same amount on an inferior product.

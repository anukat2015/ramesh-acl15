Title: Wonderful Camera
Content:
My wife and I bought this camera in the Summer of '06.  We wanted to get a camera that we'd never have to replace.  We got our wish.
I'm an amateur amateur photographer.  Zero training.  Picking up this camera, practicing with it's settings, and reading the manual has done wonders for my family photo albums.  Photography used to frustrate me because I didn't understand the lingo and the numbers.  I still don't really understand them, but I know what settings to plug into my camera to produce clear, amazing photographs.  And because this camera is fun for this amateur to use, it makes it fun to learn the specifics of photography.  I've since added a telephoto lens and a wide angle lens to my camera bag, and it's a breeze going back and forth between them.  You'll enjoy photography with this camera.
One drawback that is worth mentioning is that the built-in flash is not the greatest in many situations.  This can be solved by adding a flash (not cheap, but well worth it).  Is this reason enough to not choose this camera?  Not at all.
If you're considering a digital SLR camera, go with this.  The cost/performance ratio is what you're looking for.

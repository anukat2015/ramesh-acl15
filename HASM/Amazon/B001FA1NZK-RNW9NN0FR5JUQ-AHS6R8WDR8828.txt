Title: Versatile, almost as though I'm holding a micro-sized laptop
Content:
When I got this iPod, I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard all of the hype, and I was hoping that it really would turn out to be as useful as people said. I had had two different iPod nanos in the past, and of course, they are just the very basic models. This iPod is different, though. If you have wi-fi you could almost consider using this as a computer. It actually does have a smooth internet connection, and I really like the compact display of web pages. Also, the apps are really a joy! I can't believe how many wonderful apps there are out there for free. Now, let's get to the iPod's original use: music. This one has the capacity to store about 2,000 songs, and that is more than enough for most people that I know. It is very easy to scroll down lists of songs, make on-the-go playlists, and shuffle. Overall, I am very happy with Apple's new addition.

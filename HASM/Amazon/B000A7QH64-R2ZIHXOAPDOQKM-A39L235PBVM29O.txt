Title: For quick fix lovers
Content:
I am not good at cleaning jobs, can't really last more than 15 minutes, so this baby vacuum cleaner is a perfect match for me. It is handy - I put it right next my dining table. I takes me couple seconds to reach it and 1-2 minutes to clean up crambs after dinner, kids' project mess, cat's hair on the couch and everything else. 
So I don't do "Big Cleaning Job" but we do leave in much cleaner house now. Amazing. The vacuum is really strong, picks up everything, it lasts much longer than I do (15 minutes), picks up cat's hair from everywhere (my allergic guests simply stopped complaining), it is easy to handle (my kids from 4 to 10 do the vacuuming themselves), it does very decent job on the carpet, it is easy to empty and with 3 different endings I have all I need.
If I need to clean the carpet, I just start with it using the brush shown on the picture, after 15 minutes we are both done. The battery is over as well as my energy, but the carpet is CLEAN, really clean. 
I am giving it 4 stars b/c the used air sometimes blows away dust before I reach it with the vacuum cleaner. I hope this could be improved in the next model.
If you are very busy with kids (and your kids are busy leaving pieces of papers and crumbs everywhere) then just stop thinking - get it. I haven't used the dustpan since I got it (about 5 months ago).

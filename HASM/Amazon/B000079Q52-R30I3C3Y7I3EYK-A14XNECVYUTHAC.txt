Title: Good heating but too bright
Content:
Obviously the whole idea of HOW this thing heats is good in the sense that it doesn't burn oxygen, and it never gets hot to the touch, and it doesn't use allot of energy.  Nevertheless, on the HIGH setting, this thing is like a spotlight. I mean, its ridiculously bright, I can't have it in front of me, I have to have it angled to the side, or it will burn out my retinas. On the other hand, for specific uses, its awesome. When I am on the computer, and its just me, I sit in on a chair next to me and aim it down at my hands. I feel OK about not running the whole house heater, and it does a great job of keeping my hands and body comfortable even if its freezing inside the house.  Don't expect this thing to warm like a heater you are used to, it literally only gives heat at whatever its pointing at, you get no heat even an inch outside of its blast radius.
Bottom line is, though, I do use it allot. It has a nice handle of the top of it and I am constantly moving it about the house and using it - so obviously its useful, and for the price, its a good deal.

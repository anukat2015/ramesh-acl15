Title: good and not so good features
Content:
I generally purchase products based on review comments and this product came with good reviews. The instructions on the top of the coffee maker are not needed and do detract from the look of the product.
Coffee brews fast and is hot. At first the no drip feature worked fine. However, after several weeks of use when I remove the carafe to take some coffee before it finishes brewing, coffee drips. Nothing worse than the smell of burnt coffee on the keeps hot plate.
I ordered another product and will try again for a coffee maker that lives up to its advertized claims.

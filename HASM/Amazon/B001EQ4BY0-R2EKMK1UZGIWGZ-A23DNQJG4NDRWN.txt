Title: Camera upgrade
Content:
I upgraded from a Canon EOS 10D. I bought this camera because the price was within my budget and I've already invested in several Canon lenses. The increased screen size was a welcome change as my customers are always wanting to see their photos right after I take them. It's very nice for me because I'm constantly reviewing my photos to verify my lighting. I managed to shoot over 250,000 photos with my 10D before the shutter gave out and I expect the 50D to do the same. The decreased shutter lag and the increase in frames per second has allowed me to get those action shots easier than before. Of course, my wedding shots have really increased in quality due to the enhanced ISO range and the ease of changing settings through the new menu. The real surprise is the ability to register the lens to the camera to remove lens dust defects from my JPGs. The software supplied with the camera removes the dust  when I transfer it to my PC. That feature alone saves me hours of work on the back end. I love this camera!

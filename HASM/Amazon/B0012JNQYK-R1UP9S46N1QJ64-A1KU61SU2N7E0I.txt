Title: Great
Content:
Great product. I would give it 5 stars but because of the interaction with iTunes, I feel like big brother is watching over me. DRM is one thing, but I don't know of any other product that you purchase where the vendor watches over your use of it like iTunes does. Creepy. Annoying. Pointless.

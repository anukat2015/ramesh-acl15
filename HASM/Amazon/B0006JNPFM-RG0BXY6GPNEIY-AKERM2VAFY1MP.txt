Title: Great heater!
Content:
We live in a large old home in Central PA, and do not have any heating source on our second floor. We heat our home with a pellet stove in our basement which provides a general passive warmth, and we have three gas cast iron stove units on the first floor, which are on a thermostat.  Most rooms in our house have large 6 foot windows, our master bath has 3 of them.  The room also faces west, and takes the brunt of most of the bad weather in winter, and is a veritable ice box, with no heat source.  We use this heater in our bathroom, set the thermostat at medium, and it warms the room nicely.  Our bathroom is about 10x10, with a separate toilet and tub alcove, so not a tiny room.  This heater is simple to use, efficient, and we have never had a problem with it, even after several years of ownership.

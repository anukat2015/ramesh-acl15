Title: Great Machine
Content:
All that I have to say is that this machine makes the best home-brewed coffee that I have ever tasted.  Granted, it is a bit of a pain to clean the grinder, but what do you expect?  Grinding coffee is messy business.  However, the stainless steel carafe is the first coffee carafe that I have ever used that I do not spill all over the place...plus it keeps the coffee hot for three to four hours.  If you crave bistro style coffee at home, buy this machine.

Title: I love this coffee maker!
Content:
My family and I love this coffee maker.  It makes amazing coffee every time.  I too had the same problem with the leaky carafe and was about to return it when I called Krups.  They shipped me a new carafe that does not dribble, so now I can say I am 100% satisfied with this coffee pot.  If you do purchase one, make sure it has the squared off spout, not the rounded one.

Title: Cool Heater
Content:
My husband and I bought this heater for our chilly basement. Our kitten likes to hang out down there while we do the laundry. It really does the job. It's so small and easy to take along with the grip on the back/top, I'll just take it with me to keep my feet warm. We bring it in the bedroom, too. The only reason for the 4 stars, I tipped it over on purpose and it didn't turn off. Good product.

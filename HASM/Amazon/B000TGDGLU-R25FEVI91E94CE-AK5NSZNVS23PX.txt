Title: Caution
Content:
One of the strengths of oil-filed heaters is silent operation.  Another such heater that I have, a Lakewood, is essentially silent.  Not so with the unit offered here.  It emits a constant high-pitched whine.  At the lowest setting (600 watts)it is obvious but sometimes tolerable.  At 900 or 1500 watts it is intolerable.  It is electrical noise, well-known to be in the most acute range of human hearing, and even at a relatively low db level it's the kind of noise that can drive you crazy.
The unit does work at producing heat.  However, mine has only limited usefulness because it is only run at the 600 watt setting and then only if completely necessary.  Even at that, it appears that the thermostat malfunctions, because even at the highest thermostat setting it will click off at low ambient temperatures.  Generally the thermostat knob gives poor visual indication of where it is set, and the setting does not seem very reliable.
My "3" rating is from gratitude for having had it when it was really necessary.

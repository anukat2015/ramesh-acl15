Title: Farberware percolator
Content:
The proof of the pudding is in how long this pot lasts--I have had pots that lasted for 15 years, and some that lasted less than 15 months.  We'll see how long this one goes.
So far so good on this pot.  It's a percolator.  Had to send one back, it didn't make coffee.  This one does and the coffee is typical perked coffee--black and strong, the way we like it.  Good!

Title: I never knew how good coffee could be!
Content:
Can I tell you I never drank coffee every day until my husband purchased this machine?  It is the greatest thing.  He likes his coffee super strong and I could not drink it, but with this we can customize our own cups.  We used to have a Senseo, which I did like, but my husband couldn't get his coffee strong enough with that machine.  I like the flavor options (can you say Hazelnut?  or Blueberry?  or Southern Pecan? ) open to me, and I tend to like the girly drinks like Hot Chocolate or Tea.  We even took it on our family reunion.  So instead of my Granddad, a former navy man,  making his one pot of hair on your chest coffee at 5 am, and the rest of us trying to water it down at 8 when we got up, we each enjoyed a fresh cup of weak, strong, or just right coffee.  Also, my kids can make their own Hot Chocolate without bothering me (they are 7 and 9).  We use it to generate hot water for other drink purposes like mixes that we already have on had.  Works great for Chai Tea mix or even Apple Cider mix. We keep ours on all the time!  
 Pros:  EASY to use- my kids can brew a cup. Good flavors- Lots of choices in coffees, teas and hot chocolate.
Cons:  I wish the water holder was bigger.  Coffee grounds are stuck around the little bin that holds the k-cups and it is difficult to clean.

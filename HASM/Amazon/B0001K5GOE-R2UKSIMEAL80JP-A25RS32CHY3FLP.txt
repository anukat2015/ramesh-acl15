Title: Needs improvement...
Content:
After reading reviews and testing this vacuum and others at the local stores, I finally bought the Dyson canister. I have wall-to-wall carpet at home. Since I have played with this vacuum many times at the stores, putting it together out of the box was very easy. The suction was very good, but few problems made me rate this vacuum less than great and I am actually returning it to the store.
1/ Like one of the reviewers mentioned before, the brush does actually slow down in my medium-thickness carpet and it did stop completely twice. 
2/ Larger objects (Cereal...) get pushed away by the brush, with the regular back and forth movement of a normal vacuuming. But once under the brush THEY GOT SUCKED AWAY...
3/ The button Carpet/floor is located at the side of the brush, which is not very convenient. Ok, that is not a big deal. But a slight bump will make it switch to floor mode. This happened to me and it would not switch back to carpet even after many attempts to pull the button. I had to turn the vacuum off and again on to get the brush going again.
4/ The brush is too small to handle larger things. I had a small piece (about 1/2&quot;x1&quot;)of plastic (bag) stuck after the brush at the entrance of the wand.
I was disappointed at this machine. I thought I did my homework!! It has a great suction power but the brush head is a problem especially for medium to high carpet. I tried it at the local store on a low carpet and it worked great.
If you don't have a medium to high carpet and don't have messy kids around, this machine might still work great for you. 
I will try the Dyson upright and hope it wont let me down too.

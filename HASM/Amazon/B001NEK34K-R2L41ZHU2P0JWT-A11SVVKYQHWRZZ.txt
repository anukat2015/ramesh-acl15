Title: I'm Lovin' it!
Content:
I bought this computer in Feb 2009 as a replacement for 2 Hp and Compaq laptops I killed off. (still had to finish my taxes). I have had no problems yet, except for finding all my discs to install my old programs.  
The screen is bright, the battery lasts quite a while.  The Harman Kardon speakers are nice, one of the reasons I bought this model.  You can actually watch a movie and hear it too.   
Another reason I got this computer was the fact that it had separate ATI Mobility Radeon HD graphics card and Intel Core 2 Duo processor.  I really did not want an integrated card.  It runs all my programs with no problems.  I have been ripping my cd collection and the DVD drive makes short work of it.  The 4GB SDRAM and 400 GB HDD are also great features for the money, especially compared to Sony prices.   
So far, I am very happy with this Toshiba Satellite A355-S6935.
I also bought a nice bag to tote my new laptop in, which is roomy and fits it well.

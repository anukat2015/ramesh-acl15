Title: Great concept &amp; Not a bad cup of coffee
Content:
I've had the coffee maker for 3 weeks and am getting accustomed to the &quot;high maintenance&quot; nature of this appliance. It does make a great cup of coffee using good beans, but it does not make much. Four mugs and it's gone...so make another pot you say... Well that's where the high maintenance comes in. Prior to firing it up again, one must wash and dry the grinder which gets steamed in the brewing process. If not dried well, the next batch of freshly ground beans will stick to the sides and top and not drain into the basket for optimum brewing. Directions recommend allowing it to &quot;dry overnight&quot; One other downer is that the carafe does not pour well. We have tried different angles but always end up with coffee on the counter. Our old reliable coffee maker is still sitting on the counter. We have not decided which one to put away.

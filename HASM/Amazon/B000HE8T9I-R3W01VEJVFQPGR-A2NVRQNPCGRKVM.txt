Title: Great vacuum for a bachelor
Content:
I vacuum my living room about once a week, but the rest of my house about once a month. This vacuum has been great! It picks up everything, it's easy to use on the stairs, as long as I keep it close to me, and it works great on smooth floors (laminate flooring and tile).
It's very easy to clean, and because of this I clean it almost every time I use it, therefore it's like using a brand new vacuum everytime.
My only complaint is that the hose is not "stretchy" enough. When I'm using the hose to clean my couches, etc, I step about a foot away from the vacuum and it starts to tip over. That's the only reason I took one star away on this review.
Overall, for the price, it's definitely worth it.

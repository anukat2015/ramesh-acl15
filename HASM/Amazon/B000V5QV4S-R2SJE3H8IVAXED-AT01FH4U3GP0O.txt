Title: Canon 40D with 28-135mm IS Lens, Superb
Content:
I've owned SLR cameras for many years. I've used this camera with the Canon 1.4 50mm lens, the Canon 70-300mm IS lens and the Canon 28-135mm IS lens that was included with the kit.
The 40D is an excellent camera. Focusing is very fast, dynamic range very wide, and ISO noise is very controlled and useable to ISO 3200. ISO range that is extended and fairly noise free is a real advantage during low light photography. I've found that many historical sights in Europe have limited lighting and flash photos are not allowed. It is in these settings that stabilized lens and expanded ISO capability are the difference between an excellent picture and one that is really unusable.
The 40D is very well made. It and all of my Canon lens are labeled made in Japan. Many of the Canon 40D competitors are built elsewhere. Japan in many circles is still considered the premier manufacturing location for ultra high quality complex electronics. This reputation was a factor in my choice of Canon line. The 28-135mm IS lens focuses very very fast, is quite sharp and the zoom range provides nice flexibility while minimizing the distortions that are present in higher range lens.
The Canon 40D is rugged, designed to professional standards, takes great pictures, is very flexible and should last for many many years. Highly recommended.

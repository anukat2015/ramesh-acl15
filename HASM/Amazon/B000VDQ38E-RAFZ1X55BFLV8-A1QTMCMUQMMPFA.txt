Title: Heavy but pretty good...in the beginning
Content:
Started off much heavier than previous upright but working somewhat well...only lasted four months!  Pet hair removal spotty at best. Canister emptying a VERY POOR design.  Can't return from where it was purchased (past 90 day return period)...WHAT a waste of money!  Definitely cannot recommend...

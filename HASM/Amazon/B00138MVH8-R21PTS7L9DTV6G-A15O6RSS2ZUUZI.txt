Title: A satisfied buyer
Content:
I purchased the Sony A350 primarily to have an up-to-date, medium-high end DSLR that would accept my Minolta lenses: I have seven. Professional photography was my first career, and had other opportunities not presented, I likely would have remained a photographer. I remained an avid amateur photographer throughout two subsequent careers, and now in retirement. I've found the the A350 a competitive DSLR, with most or all of the functions and modes of similar price-range cameras. Couple that with allowing me to use my collection of Minolta lenses, I've made a good choice. One feature I particularly like since I print large format copies of many of my photos is the menu selection "Creative Style" allowing shooting in Adobe Photoshop color space.
Two downers: 
1. The LCD screen is particulary vulnerable protruding rearward to accommodate the LCD tilt function. Moreover, when using the viewfinder, skin oils and sweat--I shoot a lot of equine sports action--soils the LCD continuously. This vulnerability is why I rated the camera 4 stars rather than 5.
2. I find the Camera Shake warning indicator distracting, and essentially useless. Even when I use a tripod the indicator indicates maximum at the slightest touch. I'll rely on controlling shutter speed.
Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the camera, and would recommend it to others.

Title: Amazing laptop for the money; 1 GB ethernet makes Internet fly
Content:
Overall, this is an outstanding little laptop for the money. I upgraded to 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM, to go along with the dual-core processor (Intel), and 250 GB hard drive. When plugged into the Ethernet directly, this laptop outperforms nearly any computer in speed. Very, very fast Internet downloads. This is a 14.1" wide-screen wxga with HD quality picture. 2 USB 2.0 ports, a VGA out, DVD/CD R/W drive, multimediacard drive, and an adequate audio card which is greatly upgraded with even tiny external speakers-- the kind that come for free with some desktop PCs. 
I use a USB 2.0 4-port adapter to expand the USB ports to 5, and can run a webcam, memory stick, external HD, wireless mouse, and USB speakers off this at the same time without a hitch. The PC runs flawlessly. PC has a nice clean looking shell, is lightweight (5 lbs), and the keyboard is very smooth, easy to use.
My only complaint is the touchpad mouse needs to be configured so it won't jump to wherever the cursor is on the page. I avoid this by using a laser mouse anyway, and the PC is great. Highly recommended if you can find one for under $450. It is also upgradeable to Windows 7, but Vista Premium works well on this.

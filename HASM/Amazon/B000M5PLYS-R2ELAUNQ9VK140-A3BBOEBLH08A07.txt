Title: Does the job, but smells
Content:
First one I had to return - when I turned it on it blew smoke.
I didn't want to get the same one, for obvious fire-averse reasons.  But looking at all the heaters, this seems to be the only one that can turn on and off to keep a temperature.
And it does that.  It's a little 'chunky' in that you need to choose from 5-degree increments (70 seems cold, 75 is hot!), but it does keep a pretty constant temperature.  No idea if 70/75 is accurate, but close enough.
The main problem is that we use it in an enclosed space, and it leaves behind a musty smell - almost like burning but not quite.  I figure that's any heater, and it's not bad, so we still use it.

Title: Versatile IPod Nano
Content:
I recently purchased the IPod Nano for my 10 year old grandson.  He absolutely loves it!  The Nano was very easy for him to learn how to use properly.  And we were pleasantly surprised by how many things you can do with the Nano.  From downloads of music, games, favorite photos, and videos, to even renting movies to watch...it is amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Think I'll even get one for myself!

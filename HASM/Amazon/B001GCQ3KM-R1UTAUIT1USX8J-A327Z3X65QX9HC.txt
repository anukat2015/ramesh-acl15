Title: Excellent MP3 player
Content:
I'm a relative newcomer to MP3 players, and I have totally enjoyed the 4-gig version of this one.  I walk for exercise and enjoy keeping up with news and interviews on NPR and with music I've downloaded from my computer's music files or listened to on FM stations.  Yesterday I was walking when a fascinating interview came on.  I remembered then a feature I hadn't used with this player--the ability to record from an FM station.  So I recorded it and saved it and have enjoyed listening to the interview again.  I find it to be the perfect size (fits easily into a pants or jacket pocket)as well as sleek and attractive.  I also enjoy listening to it as I go to sleep at night.  It turns off automatically after I fall asleep.   I know that I can also record memos to myself, but I haven't used this feature yet. I recommend it to anyone who would like a good portable device for music and radio. I purchased a good little carrying case for it, which I also recommend.

Title: A practical item
Content:
The Sunbeam hot shot beverage is one of the most practical easy to use electrical items I purchased. It is also economical.
The two things I would like to know before purchasing is the capacity - 2 small cups or 1 large mug of hot water and the length of the electrical cord - 25 inches long.
Overall I think this is an excellent item to have, and is probably best for a single person or college student to have while living in the dormn.

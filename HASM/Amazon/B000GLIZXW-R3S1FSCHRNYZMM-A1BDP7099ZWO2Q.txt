Title: Perfect for this situation
Content:
We have a beautiful stone Swedish fireplace in the living room that hasn't been used for years, in fact we used it to display artificial plants and flowers. I found this unit on Amazon while searching encased units, so knowing Amazon'z return policy, I took a chance it would work in this situation. I am more than pleased with the unit and it fit perfectly inside the firebox. I can sit 90 degrees from the front of fireplace and it still looks very realistic. We had painted the firebox black years ago so you need to get within 4 or 5 feet to realize the unit is not part of the firebox.

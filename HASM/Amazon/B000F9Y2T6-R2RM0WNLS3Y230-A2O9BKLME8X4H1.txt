Title: disappointing
Content:
This cleaner is not very maneuverable and is very noisy.  It leaves streaks from the rubber squeegee on the floor.  The vacuum option is not an option as the range for the suction is limited to the dirt directly aligned with the entry hole - otherwise the dirt is pushed along or missed.  My standard vacuum and an electronic steam mop (with micro fiber pads) was a much better solution.  I apply a floor cleaner from a misting/squirt bottle where needed.

Title: It Works Great
Content:
Pros:
It does what it says.  It picks up the hair and has good suction.  The tools work great for getting hair out hard to reach places that you can't get with the vac.  This about as the Dyson or better for the price you pay. Bissell $150 vs Dyson $500 and you about the same cleaning.  
Cons:
Nothing is perfect.  A little trouble putting it togather and it is bit larger and heavier then the Dyson.  The only other that is a downside is that is a bit loud. Oh and it does not work well on hard floors either but neither did the Dyson
I would have given 5 stars if it worked better on hard floors and was not so loud

Title: Good little vacuum
Content:
This is a good little vacuum and I can't complain about the price. It's light but powerful. One problem...the metal wand constantly detaches from the plastic wand it attaches to. It's dropped on my foot a couple of times which really HURTS. No matter how tight I insert it, it eventually detaches.  I hope someone from Hoover reads this and that they do something about it.

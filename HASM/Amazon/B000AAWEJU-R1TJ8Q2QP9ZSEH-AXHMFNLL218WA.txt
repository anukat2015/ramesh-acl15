Title: Worth every penny!
Content:
After coveting my sister's, my mother's and my sister-in-law's Meile, I received one for a gift.  It has changed the way I approach cleaning!  Not only is it extremely lightweight but it is very powerful and will clean anything!  It comes with 3 extra attachments that are very useful and the bags/filters are very easy to replace.  They redesigned my vacuum and took out the "unnecessary extras" as my mom would say.  This makes it much more compact and even lighter than the previous models.  They honestly did not forget anything on this model!  The handle extends based on your height and can also be attached/placed in one of two positions when not in use.  There is a little switch that makes the suction less intense if you are vacuuming throw rugs, etc.  The brush has a bare floor and a carpet setting.  It alerts you when the bag is full.  What more can I say!  It's worth every penny!

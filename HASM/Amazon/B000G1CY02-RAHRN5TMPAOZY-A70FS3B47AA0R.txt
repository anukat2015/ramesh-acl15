Title: Just great!
Content:
First off, be sure to run this thing in an area where you won't care about its smell for its first few hours.
After that, it works great.  Heats up fast, not very hot to the touch, but it throws perfect heat into my bedroom.  I bought it to provide some additional heat in the bedroom for a winter newborn.  Very happy with it after one month.

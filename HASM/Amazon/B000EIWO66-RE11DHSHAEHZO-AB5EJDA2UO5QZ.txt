Title: So far, So good
Content:
I've only had the vacuum for about a month and a half, but I've been quite pleased with it so far. The adjustable suction has been a handy feature for going from delicate cleaning straight to more durable items. I don't feel that it does quite as well as I'd hoped for switching right over from carpet to bare floors, but most of our house is carpeted so it's still okay for us. Plus it has many GREAT attachments to choose from. It's kind of nice having a canister for a change of pace (I've stuck with uprights up until now). Being able to get under the beds is GREAT! This may be my favorite feature. It's so easy. It's not very noisy and that is also a good thing. It does a GREAT job on making the carpets look SO clean! And it is fun to use. I love to clean and I clean a lot, so it's important for me to be happy with my vacuum. I definitely am and would recommend it HIGHLY!

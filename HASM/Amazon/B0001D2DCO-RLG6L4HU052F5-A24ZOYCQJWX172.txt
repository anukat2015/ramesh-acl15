Title: My Review, PAC700T
Content:
I bought the 700 Pinquino A/C unit because of its excellent energy efficiency and quiet operation.  I liked the looks too, so many others look so ugly that I would not have them in my livingroom. I have had the unit for two years now, and so far no problems at all.  It  works great, and is very quiet, and cools my 700sqft room well, although it takes a while when above 90F.  The water reservoir lasts about a day before needing refilling. My only complaint is a minor one:  The plastic finish is of good quality, but it scratches easily when moving the unit around and you bump into something.  If it had some color matching bumper strips or something around its middle section, that might help.  I am happy with this unit.

Title: Very disappointed
Content:
I ordered my Nikon D300 Nov. 18, 2008.  I have wanted a Nikon for many years and after I got into digital I wanted a dslr.  I decided the Nikon D300 would be the best I could buy.  It worked great for about 2 months.  Now it has developed the dead power problem.  The AF stops working after a few shots.  When it is cold it is worse.  At first it thought -20 was cold now it thinks 40 above is to cold.  Doesn't matter which lens is on it and a freshly charged very warm batters makes no difference at all.  The problem is getting worse fast.  Now I am finding lists of people who are having the same problem.  I am going to do some calling tomorrow and find out where to send it back.  I always believed Nikon was one of the best cameras.  I guess I was wrong.  I would recommend that you consider some other camera rather then the Nikon D300.

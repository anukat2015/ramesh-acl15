Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
I got this vacuum for my daughter and her husband who have a dog and two cats that shed terribly.  She had tried my Kirby and Dyson, and neither did the job.  But this vacuum worked just great and removed the hair from throw rugs and furniture with no difficulty.  What would normally take her five to ten minutes to vacuum was done in a couple of minutes.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone with pets!!

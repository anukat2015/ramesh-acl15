Title: Great Machine!
Content:
We purchased the 1160us version with 6g of RAM.  We HIGHLY recommend the upgrade!  With 6g of RAM, it's a very powerful, fast, robust machine.  The only negative is the screen should have a matte finish instead of a glossy finish.  But that's something you can work around.  Comes with lots of software.  We bought the machine for our daughter going to college and like it so much that we plan on buying the 18" version for ourselves.  We particularly like the bluetooth connectivity.  As for the negative reviews that you'll read about the bluetooth or any other feature of this laptop, I attribute them to people who simply didn't follow the excellent directions included witht the machine.  Also, we heard horror stories about the 64 bit version of Vista but we've had no problems whatsoever with it.
Bought it from Buydig.  Lowest price on the web BEFORE rebate, free shipping, rebate was in my hands in three weeks.
LOVE THE MACHINE!

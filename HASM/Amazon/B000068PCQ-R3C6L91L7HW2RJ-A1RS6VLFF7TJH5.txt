Title: I loved this product
Content:
We just got our Zojirushi Gourmet Duet Dual-Mug Personal Coffeemaker this weekend. We used Boca Java blended coffees and our well water (we live in the boondocks). The directions were simple to understand. The amount of coffee that fills the cups was perfect. We used regular #2 filters (not the unbleached kind). I was stoked! This is a great cup of coffee! We have used $400 coffee makers that didn't perform like this. I definitely recommend this!

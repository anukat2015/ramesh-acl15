Title: Love this camera, can't add to the rest of the reviews
Content:
The rest of the reviews say it all in tech words mostly.  I'll just say that if you are an SLR fan, this is the DSLR you should jump in with.  It adds features that previous DSLRs lacked.  Although it's not the end-all camera, it is pretty much future proof.  If you need better image quality, then you need to spend the 6k on a 5d or something else higher end.  For people who are just coming into DSLR from point and shoot or from 35mm, this camera provides all you need in auto features at great quality.  I recommend the Magic Lantern Guide (DVD and/or book), it helped me get to know the camera much quicker.  also [...] has loads of info on the camera.

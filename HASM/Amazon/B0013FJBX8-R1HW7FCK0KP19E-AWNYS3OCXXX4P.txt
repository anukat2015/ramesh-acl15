Title: 4 Months Later....Loving it Every Day
Content:
I don't expect this to be rated as an extremely helpful review as I will keep my comments short. There are plenty of reviews which go into great detail and can answer all the questions you may have.
After owning this MacBook Pro for 4 months, I just wanted to say that I am happy every day that I made this purchase!! This is simply a stunningly well designed, solid notebook. I have had 5 or 6 notebook PCs over the last 10 years and none have pleased me as much as this one.
It may be more expensive as the recent Microsoft commercials choose to point out, but the premium I invested has been repaid with the highest level of satisfaction I have ever had.

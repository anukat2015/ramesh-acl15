Title: Pass on this one...
Content:
Pros: Elegant styling, decent build quality, easy to use, carafe stays cool outside which is safer with little ones probing hands around
Cons: Coffee flavor harsh and coffee temp too low even at brew time, much less any time later
I bought this after seeing the largely positive reviews, and now regret it.  Coming from a Krups (10 year old model) to this was a massive let down.  The coffee in the pot and during brewing is 15*F and 10*F colder respectively than my old Krups (measured with probe) and both taste and ability to add cream (and still have decently hot coffee) suffer.  
This is before even considering the carafe, which doesn't do a creditable job of keeping the coffee warm if not preheated or not full (or both).  
If you're looking for a machine to make full pots on demand, and can handle the somewhat harsh taste of the coffee, by all means this is the machine for you. Other than these sore spots, it is excellent (but what use is bad coffee?).  
If you prefer a smoother, richer cup of coffee and wish to use the timer to make a half carafe or so in the morning, cross this one off your list right now. Run, don't walk.

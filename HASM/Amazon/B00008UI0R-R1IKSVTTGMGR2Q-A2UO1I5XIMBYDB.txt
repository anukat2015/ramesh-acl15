Title: Tough bristle
Content:
Pros has a powerful adjustable suction, powerful power brush and adjustable extended handle. Cons the bristle of the power brush are too tough. My carpet is like being trimmed everytime I used it. You don't need a tough bristle for this vacuum because it has a good suction. The adjustable extended handle should have been better if you can twist it left or right to get under the bed easily without hitting the rail. If not because of the tough bristle I'll give it a 5 star.

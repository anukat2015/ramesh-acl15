Title: Way better than the D300
Content:
I have owned a D100, D200, and D300... this camera is so much improved that I believe it should have been called the D400 instead of the D300s. There aren't that many new features vs the D300, but the speed of operation is so much better that I just can't believe it. Shooting raw files (and raw+JPG) at full "motor-drive" speed is now possible. I also have a D700 so I'm happy that the controls and the memory-compartment door are now harmonized with the D700.

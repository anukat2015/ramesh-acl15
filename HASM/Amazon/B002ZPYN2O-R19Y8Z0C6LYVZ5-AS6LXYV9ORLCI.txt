Title: A wonderful laptop, except the speakers
Content:
This is my 2nd laptop.  My first was a 2006 HP DV5063CL, back when the quality control dropped, but they still had a good reputation.  I love this laptop.  Fast, well equipped and has a great keyboard.  I have always used a USB plug-in keyboard on my HP so that I had numeric keys available without the Num Lock gyrations.  Well, the Satellite has a built in numeric keyboard.  The touch of the keys is pleasing as well.  I not only don't need my keyboard, I don't want it either.
My only complaint is the lack of quality in the speakers.  They sound tinny.  Even with all drivers updated.  Their volume is not that great either.  My HP laptop had Altec Lansing speakers, and sounded much better than the S5988.
Still, speakers are a minor point.  I will use external speakers at home, or a USB sound D/A converter with the external speakers, or headphones at home and when I am out.

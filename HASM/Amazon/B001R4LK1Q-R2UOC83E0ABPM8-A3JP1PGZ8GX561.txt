Title: Great product
Content:
I had a traditional 12 cup coffee maker and I was tired of the burnt taste and scalding of the pot. This product is great coffee tastes fresh all the time, I love the ability to keep it warm for up to 4hrs...and that I can program to have my coffee ready for me every morning when I wake up.
My only issue is that when you have filled your cup and pull the cup away the coffee always seems to run down the side of the cup.
This product is easy to clean and is very sleek in design. I highly recommend this product.

Title: Great overall camera.
Content:
I just got this for valentine's day and love it.  I am not a professional photographer and I have only had it a week or so, but someone who appreciates good photos.  I am going on my honeymoon to the mediterranean and am learning how to use it now.  There's not much skill involved to get great shots out of the box.  The (fast) shutterspeed is why I chose this over a digital non-SLR camera.  I do plan on getting a good telephoto lens soon.  I was able to plug it right into my computer and use my existing photo editor with it - no problems. I would highly recommend this camera to everyone I know.  Nikon makes great products.

Title: CR "Top Pick"
Content:
The Electrolux EL 6988D Canister Vacuum was one of Consumer Reports top picks.  (It was actually number 2 on the list).  #1 was a Kenmore, which we refused to purchase as our last 3 Kenmore vacuums have essentially broken down within 3-4 year time frame.  I was very tempted to buy the Dyson Animal, but it didn't "score" as high with CR.  
So far, it is working well.  It is lightweight, easy to carry around.  Works well on carpets and furniture.  Ok on our hardwood floors.  (Better off using the attachment for these, which unfortunately doesn't clip onto the vacuum anywhere-- has to be stored separately.)
Minor Negatives:
-No dirt sensor.
-The power cord is shorter than expected.
-The swivel mechanism takes some energy to overcome to get the vacuum to move in the direction you want.  This also makes it a little difficult to do the stairs. 
So far, so good.  We'll see how it pans out...  our friends have the Dyson and describe their feelings of "love at first sight" with it.  I don't know that I have the same feelings of love for the Electrolux but we're giving it a chance.

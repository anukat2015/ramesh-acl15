Title: This percolator is awful!
Content:
I bought this percolator a few weeks ago, I've used it a total of three times and it never worked right.
It makes the coffee okay, but it doesn't turn off like it should and the second time I used it it cycled twice!
I don't know where this percolator was made but the quality is cheap.  I have an old one from my mother-in-law and that one is 100% better.  I don't have the box so I cannot return it, but next time I'll make sure it was made in the good ole U.S of A!  I gave it two stars because the coffee still tastes good, but since I have to unplug it right away the the coffee gets cold it isn't worth the money.

Title: Zune Opinion - 6 months in
Content:
I've had my Zune for about 6 months now, and it has fast become a valuable and entertaining part of my tech. I was previously attracted to the alternative the Zune gave to the iPod, as the items were previously pretty similar. 
However, now that the Zune 3.0 software has been released, it's versatility has increased dramatically. Things such as the Channels, which provide you with a list of songs each week that conform to a theme of your choosing. The Pics section, which provides suggestions for you based on your current listening habits, is a great way to explore new music. I'm not using the buy from FM (a feature which tells you what song and arist you are listening to on the radio, and gives you the option to buy it) or the Zune Marketplace (which allows you to buy songs over a wifi connection and instantly download them), but I can see how they would be useful to others.
But the killer app that compliments all these features is the Zune Pass, which for a monthly fee allows you to download as many songs as you like. This makes finding and trying new music interesting, fun and legal. 
I find it amazing how much this device has changed since I bought it, both on the Zune hardware side, and the software side. If they continue to expand this versatility I think I will be owning my Zune for a long time to come.
I'd heartily recommend the Zune to anyone wanting to expand their music collection and expose themselves to new artists and styles. If that's you, then the Zune is your device.

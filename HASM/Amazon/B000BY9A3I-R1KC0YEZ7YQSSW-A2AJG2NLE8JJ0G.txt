Title: This vacuum is Awesome!!!
Content:
This vacuum is absolutely great! It does a great job on bare floors, I don't know about carpets, we don't have any in our home. It is so easy and convenient to use our house stays cleaner because it's no longer a chore to wrestle with the vacuum. The wand is great and reaches anywhere and you really don't even need the attachments because it has such great suction. Very good around corners and under tables and beds. We have a Rottweiler, a doberman, and a dachshund, and there is no longer any hairballs or tracked in dirt of any kind in our home. It is most definitely worth the money!

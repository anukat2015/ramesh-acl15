Title: Carafe Handle Broken already
Content:
My daughter gave this to me for Christmas.  It is now April 13th and already the carafe handle is broken.  I called the company and they are sending me a free one, but they must have a really big problem with this because they are on backorder and will not be available for 6-8 weeks.    I agree with earlier review that the hole to put the water in is small and awkward, also it is difficult to see the water level as it fills.  Condensation builds over the grounds and whenever you remove the basket to clean, water drips all over. It doesn't seem to matter if it is hot or cold, it always drips.  Otherwise, it works great it is fast and I love the look. It frees up counter space and is not big and bulky looking.

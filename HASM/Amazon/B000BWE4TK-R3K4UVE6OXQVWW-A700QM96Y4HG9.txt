Title: Great Intro DSLR
Content:
If you want to learn how to take superb pictures with a digital camera and have total control over how your photos come out, this camera will make you very happy. If you want a camera that does everything for you, the D50 will accommodate you on auto mode, but you'd be wasting the camera's potential, not to mention your money.
I wanted a camera that would let me play with the manual controls I missed from my film SLR days, but that would allow my husband to point and shoot, as well. I couldn't be happier with the D50. It's incredibly fast - ready to take pictures as soon as you switch it on. The lack of shutter delay is heaven after missing so many good pictures thanks to the delay on my previous digicam.

Title: Still working great after 4 years
Content:
I have had this machine since I moved into my first apartment more than four year ago.  It still works great and I use it everyday, sometimes twice a day.  The milk frother does a great job as long as you read the instructions and do it correctly, I have never run out steam before the milk was frothed.  It's very convienient for a small kitchen because it is so economical on space, especially for a combo machine.

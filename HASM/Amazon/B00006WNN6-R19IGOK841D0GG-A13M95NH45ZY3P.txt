Title: good space heater
Content:
This is a very compact, but good heater. during a recent cold spell here in Hawaii it was in the mid to upper 50's( I know that cold for us is not cold for the Mainland!) and the DeLonghi Heater fan worked wonderfully, warming a 25'x20' room to a more palatable 73F. The reason for only 4 stars is I'm not sure if it would work well in colder climates, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. price was a little on the high side, but the free shipping made up for it.

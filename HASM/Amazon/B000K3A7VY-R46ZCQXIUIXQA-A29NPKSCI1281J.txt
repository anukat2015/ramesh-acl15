Title: Mr Coffee Fails to Deliver
Content:
I bought this coffee maker while it was on sale because the features appealed to me.  I walked out of the store very happy with my decision.  I used the Mr Coffee for about 5 months before the clock (LCD) disappeared!!! Every minute hand placeholder was displayed making it unreadable and unsetable.  So much for timed brew.
I am currently in the process of contacting Mr Coffee to see if they will do anything about it.  I will return with my results.

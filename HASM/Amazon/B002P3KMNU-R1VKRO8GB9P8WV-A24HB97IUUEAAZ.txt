Title: Great combination
Content:
Great Laptop for business travel. But for office network you will have to upgrade to Windows to I believe Ultimate or Pro.
Pros Keyboard, Screen, Large HD, HDMI Output lots of connectivity no problems with wireless as someone else stated.
Cons web cam more than 1 mp camera would be nice and blue tooth would have been nice but both can be added inexpensively.
All in all a good value Asus makes a reliable laptop this is my second and first for business,

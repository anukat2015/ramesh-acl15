Title: Great Laptop, Great Price, and a Good Deal
Content:
I got this laptop to just get emails and surf, as well as do a bit of work on trips.  Having a small screen which could do at least 720 lines of resolution was a must for working in Microsoft Outlook and websites.  I've tried those NETBOOKS with the Atom processors and the 600 line screens, they are very, very limited in what they can do.
This Dell 11z with the Dual Core Pentium and the (i don't know how they did it for this price) 4GB of ram is all you'll need for your day to day work.  The 6cell battery is a must, all these laptops suck up power; its what computers do now.  The 11in screen is big enough for the young/middle-aged eyes.
Now for the negatives:
Glossy screen is sharp but can get abit glary, but just adjust it.
The touchpad takes a good day or two to get used to, but it is good after that.
HDMI performance is abit weak, a VGA port would have been nice to also have.
Top is a fingerprint magnet, what can you do....
and lastly, but important for me.
The SD card slot leaves the card sticking out, other Dell's have it go completely in. It would be nice to keep the card in without the possiblity of breaking it off...
at around $480, you won't find much better.

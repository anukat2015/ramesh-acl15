Title: True: This vacuum SUCKS and it's worth the price
Content:
My mom forced me to buy this vacuum cleaner two weeks ago. Well, I just LOVE it (I named it Rubino because it's red). Rubino is not noisy, is easy to carry around (it has 4 weels), and it sucks all the dirt that you have around the house.  I bought the version for wood floor, and it comes with another hose for pillow and matresses, and one with a brush for smaller surfaces. With a simple touch of your foot, the electric wire goes back to place. It's almost a pleasure to use...

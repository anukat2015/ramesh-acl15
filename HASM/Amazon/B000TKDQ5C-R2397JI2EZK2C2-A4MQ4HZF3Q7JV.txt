Title: good option for a medium sized space
Content:
We purchased this heater for our daughter who resides in a two bedroom trailer. Since the heat for the trailer is propane (quite expensive) she turns down the heat at night. In the morning, she uses this heater to warm the hallway, bathroom and bedrooms. It does a good job there so that they can get ready for school and work in comfort. I have owned one of these same heaters for years and it is really great supplimental heat for our four-seasons room (16'x16'). It takes only about fifteen to twenty minutes to raise the temperature ten to twelve degrees. This allows us to do zone heating without raising our furnace above 66 degrees, which is where we keep it in the winter. For the price, this is an excellent heater. The noise level is very low, regardless what other reviewers have said. Good value and it arrived promptly. I'm waiting for the first electric bill to judge how econimical it really is.

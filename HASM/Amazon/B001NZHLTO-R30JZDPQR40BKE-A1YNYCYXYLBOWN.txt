Title: the evil of suction
Content:
Ten days in. Last week, my wife on the other end of the phone said "I don't like it, it's too hard to push on the carpet" (her first use). "What!" I thought, four figures lighter in my wallet and she doesn't like it. I got home after work and the machine was close by in the basement. I picked up the handle with the carpet head and tried it. The head glided over the carpet with no resistance, "it feels ok I said". "You have to turn it on", she said. I replied something like "ok, you mean because you now have a vacuum cleaner that actually sucks hard enough to give some resistance, you don't like it!" She must have though about this because lately she has commented on how quiet it is and how it does the furniture so well, she isn't going to give it up now.
Is it possible to give an unbiased view after spending over $1000 on a vacuum cleaner. Let's just say here's my 2 cents.
- the canister is a bit heavier than I thought but no different from the old Kenmore canister.
- the machine is quiet for a vacuum cleaner but that does not mean it's quiet, i.e. some great progress has been made with appliances such as dishwashers (almost silent) but I won't hold my breathe for vacuum cleaners or hair dryers.
- the components look and feel good quality and they work well together.
  - I cannot get the hang of hooking the brush and handle to the canister to stand upright when not in use. The mechanism does not work well, it takes several tries but this is small potatoes.
- as mentioned excellent suction and the auto setting can be over-ridden.
- the delivery from United Vacuums (via Amazon) beat the schedule by a couple days in excellent condition
- the switches and lights are intuitive and its easy to work controls by foot and not having to bend over.
- my wife who doesn't read manuals, read the manual and is teaching me things about it
- the compartments open and close with ease and feel sturdy
No complaints so far and we're banking on things staying that way for a while as in years, that's what we paid for.

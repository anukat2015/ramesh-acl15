Title: Light and cool but short battery time
Content:
I've had this about 3 months and no problems.
Pros:
keyboard layout - lots of space
light
stays very cool
cool design / appearance
very good performance
Cons:
short battery life (lucky to get 2.5 hours)
touchpad is still weird feeling
keyboard feels a bit delicate/cheap

Title: Only buy if you need the features unique to it
Content:
There are two types of people who will not be unhappy with this product. First there is the casual user who wants lots of space, no hassle or forced software to load media up and dosen't care too much about tech stuff like pixel resolution, is not an audiophile and doesn't mind Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to charging you.
Second is the technical savvy geek who needs the specific things that only an Archos can give you. The three things are:
1) Massive storage (160gb)
2) USB host
3) Wifi hard drive
If you fit either of these types of user, then go ahead otherwise you will just be unhappy and join the ranks who wish they bought a Cowon. Why? I only have 300 words so I am going to list it out:
1) Do not let the linux base of this device fool you. This is a locked down device. 
2) It only supports 720x480 res video (or the equivelent PAL vertical res if on PAL mode) eventhough the Archos has a 800x480 res. Your video will either have black bars or will be scaled to oversize, your choice.
2) If you want a remote, you MUST buy the DVR station and not the mini one. Only the full DVR station has an IR receiver. The full DVR dock is huge not something you would ever want to travel with.
3) Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to squeeze money out of you is rather irritating. For me its not the money, but it means you have to carry, keep track of, etc these docks when you travel with them.  This unit does not have a replaceable battery, so you NEED the battery dock (otherwise your battery life is terrible).
I've hit the word limit but there are 4 other items on this list.

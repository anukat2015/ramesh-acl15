Title: Are we talking about the same machine?
Content:
Unlike other reviewers I found this machine to be so far below acceptable that I sent mine back. It is made of the cheapest, flimsiest plastic, does NOT take a #4 filter (hence the reference to the non-existent #3), does not have an integrated insultaion system, but needs a seal to be inserted, and is a total lack of value. The cheapest Mr. Coffee maker would work as well and be better value.

Title: Very nice heater with a remote
Content:
I bought one of these at Wal-Mart for $28 (their normal price is ~$42). Since it is a 1500 watt ceramic heater, it heats as well as any other ceramic heater that draws that much current, so nothing to comment about on that point. What that means is it will heat up your room, but it will take a while if it is not a small room. To be expected. Since it is not a radiant (quartz) heater, unless you stand very close, you will not feel a lot of warmth until the ambient T goes up and that will happen from the ceiling area on down.
It operates quite quietly (fan and rotation)and is not annoying. The rotation is smooth. The remote is a very nice touch and handier than I thought it would be. The LED display is bright, but located on top, so you can't see it from  the front of the unit if you are seated. A design flaw, I think. The three warranty is nice. Cobstruction is pretty much all plastic, so I wonder how well the heat grates will stand up over time when the plasticizers evaporate out of the plastic. Nice styling. There is a handle, but someone stopped thinking too soon and there is nothing for your fingers to grip, so you cannot pick it up sercurely with one hand.
As the other reviewer said, the cord does get warm, but not hot. The insulation is the same thickness as in other space heaters I looked at not really fragile. I don't think there is cause to worry here. It does not appear to be UL listed, however, which may be common among cheap space heaters and is slightly disconcerting. Probably a cost control measure.
Overall a nice unit with no serious flaws and adequate heating.

Title: Expensive coffee maker for only 1 year use
Content:
Cuisinart has known problem with this coffee maker.  The lid builds up condensation and when you open it, it runs down the back and eventually your timer/brewing mechanism will go out.  Multiple reviews have had the same problem.  Granted, when I called Cuisinart, they are willing to replace it.  (Immediately reached a customer service rep on a Sunday afternoon).  But I have to pay the shipping out and include a $10 check for return shipping, and in the meantime, I am a month without a coffee maker.  
Oh... and by the way, the customer service rep was immediately aware of the problem, so it is a known problem to Cuisinart as well.  When I asked the customer service rep if I could replace this machine with a different machine since it is a known defect, she said no, you can only replace like machine for like machine.  I guess your only hope is they will discontinue the product.
If you are unfortunate like me and only read this review after you have already purchased the product, my suggestion would be to open the lid just a small amount to hopefully prevent the condensation from running down the back and keeping it in the grinds basket.  Then after the condensation has run off, open in the remainder of the way to remove the grinds or add water.

Title: Hot, Hot, Hot!
Content:
I purchased this heater to warm my office at school...the nuns won't turn on the radiators until you can see your breath...inside the building!  I have 13 foot ceilings in this office and it keeps it toasty.  I've been very pleased with it's performance,  especially since I paid only $9.95 for it!   The fan feature comes in handy,  as there is,  of course,  no air conditioning at school either!  Great value,  great product.

Title: NOT WORTH IT!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker about 4 months ago and it is already in the garbage.  After the first month coffee would slowly come out of the carafe around the silver strip near the bottom and get on the burner and the smell of burnt coffe would fill the house.  Then this weekend as I was filling the carafe with water it cracked.  Carafe's online are $20 + shipping.  NOT WORTH IT!  So, I went out and bought a Cuisnart Coffee on Demand 12 cup programmable coffee maker and so far it is wonderful!  Flavorful and hot coffee and even better there is no carafe to worry with!!!

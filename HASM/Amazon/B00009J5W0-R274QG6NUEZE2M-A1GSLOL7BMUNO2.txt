Title: iPods die as soon as the warranty ends
Content:
I have purchased multiple iPods and they always die as soon as the warranty ends, I have many problems who have had the same experience. Apple has terrible customer services and basically tells you that you are SOL if you don't have an extended warranty. On top of that, although you are covered for one year, after a few months you no longer can recieve free customer service and they make you pay just to call and say that your iPod which is under warranty is broken needs to be replaced. I don't know if there is any other brand that works much better, but i'd suggest spending less money and buy a competitive product, atleast you won't feel ripped off because you paid so much more when it breaks.

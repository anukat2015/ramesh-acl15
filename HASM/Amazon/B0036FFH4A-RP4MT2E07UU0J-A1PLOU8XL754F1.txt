Title: Worth the money but not a NV5929U.
Content:
I am still loading software. This computer fast but it is still a NV5927U with an i5 chip. The NV5929U is a computer with i5, with other similar specs but it lacks a BluRay. So, this is actually an excellent deal. If it holds up 30 days, it will be even a better deal. I only say that because every time I buy a computer, there is a better deal within a month of the purchase. Oh well, that's technology for you.

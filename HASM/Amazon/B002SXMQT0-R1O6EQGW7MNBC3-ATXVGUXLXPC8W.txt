Title: Great Deal
Content:
It was a Black Friday deal for $200. It is pretty much a bottom of the line laptop by today's standards, but the value is phenomenal. It has only been a couple of months, but the machine has performed perfectly. Anyone who complains about the machine being underpowered is trying to use it for things it wasn't meant for and if they want a computer for this cheap that can do those things well... they don't understand technology and economics. Also in my experience most people who complain about their machines breaking down quickly either had bad luck or don't know how to properly care for their machines, because I have had many computers that people claimed break down quickly and they have all lasted me for years with no problems. So far this machine has been phenomenal. Are there better computers out there? Yes. For this value? Not that I have seen.

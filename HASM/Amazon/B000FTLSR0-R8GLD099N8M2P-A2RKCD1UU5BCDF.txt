Title: What's not to love?
Content:
Bombproof construction, takes rechargeable AA's, compatible with a bazillion K-mount and M42 screw mount lenses made over the years. The optical quality of Pentax's lenses is legendary, and they are plentiful and inexpensive on the used market. I mostly use my K100D with a 40-year-old Super-Takumar 50mm f/1.4 screw mount lens, and the lens' optical quality and build quality blow away just about any modern lens...best of all they run about $[...]. I'd like to see you do that with a Canon or Nikon DSLR.

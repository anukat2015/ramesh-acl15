Title: Works great - Then dies
Content:
I've had mine for about a year, and it worked great the whole time! Lots of power, and was easy to empty. But all of a sudden it died. I tried to turn it on (had been plugged in to the recharger), and nothing happened. Now I'm left wondering what to do with it. Maybe a back scratcher??

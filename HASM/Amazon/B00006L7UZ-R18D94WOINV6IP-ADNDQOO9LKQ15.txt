Title: Good space heater
Content:
I have used this in my garage for several years now, if I have my garage door closed it will warm the space pretty well.  Directly under the heater its really nice and toasty, but the furthest corner of the garage will still be cold.  In a 20-degree day with the garage door closed (I have a two-car garage with most of the garage walls NOT insulated), I get over 70 degrees directly under the heater (where I usually change the oil etc.) and at least 40 degrees at the coldest corner of the garage.  Most of the garage becomes very comfortable to work in, that I usually don't even need to wear a jacket.  BUT - as soon as I open the garage door, I lose all the warm air and it takes a little while to heat the whole place back up.   That being said, I typically also let it run for an hour or so before I start working on my car, just so I know the area is nicely heated.
Hope that helps. :)

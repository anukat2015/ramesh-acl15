Title: So far, so good
Content:
We only gave this four stars because we haven't had it very long.  But so far, it has done everything we've wanted it to do. Picks up coffee grounds from in between the tiles in our kitchen and whiskers from my fiance's shaving in the morning. It's great and inexpensive.

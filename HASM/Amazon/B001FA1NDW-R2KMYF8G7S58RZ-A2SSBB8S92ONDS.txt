Title: Works for what it's made for.
Content:
It works perfectly well for what it's meant for. Listening to music and/or watching videos.
Much like everyone else said it doesn't work with SOME (not ALL) older docking devices.
(It works will my speaker that were made just before the 3rd gen Nano, but not with my car FM transmitter, which I got when Ipods were new)
The automatic coverflow when you turn it on it's side really bothered me. My last Ipod didn't have cover flow of any kind.
It's kind of cool when you actually want to use it (which I never do) but the fact that it goes to coverflow automatically when you turn it on it's side is totally not needed.
I even had a problem where everytime I did want to use coverflow or anything that required the motion sensor it would totally freeze up for about a minute. The only remedy for this was to restore it to factory settings which totally sucks.
I'm not a big fan on the whole "shake to shuffle" thing either. I can't take it running, dancing, or do much of anything with a lot of movement unless I lock it. And that's not really an efficient way of fixing the problem.
Even with the glitches the fact of the matter is that it works for what I got it for and I like it. The only stuff that really bothers me about it is stuff that isn't really that important. So I don't really mind.

Title: Must Have for the Coffee Drinker
Content:
I bought this coffee maker for myself for Christmas. I had a Senseo, liked the convenience, as I usually only have time for one cup of coffee on work days, using my Krups on the weekends. However, the coffee was not very good from the Senseo. The Keurig B-60 has become my only coffee maker, I haven't even used my Krups machine in over a month. Cost per cup may be a little more, but I never pour out coffee that I didn't get around to drinking. The variety of coffee available is quite large, just shop the internet for deals. I like Timothy's Extra Bold Fair Trade Wind. Love the different size cups available, sometime I adjust according to coffee I am brewing. Fun to experiment with! Hot tea comes out great too. You can also use for hot water for hot chocolate. Machine also looks great on my counter, with the stainless steel accents and blue LED lights. If you buy any one-cup coffee maker, buy a Keurig, you won't be disapointed!

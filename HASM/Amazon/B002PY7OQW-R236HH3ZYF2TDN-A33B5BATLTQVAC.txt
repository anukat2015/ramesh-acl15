Title: Lovin' it
Content:
I purchased this laptop for home use mostly media.  I wanted to get my personal info off of my work laptop.  For media and home use it has worked great.  I have had a small glitch in that the operating system is too new to operate an interface program I wanted to install, but I am sure with time I can work it out.

Title: Amazing pet hair removal!
Content:
This vacuum is absolutely amazing.  I could not wait to try it out the day it was delivered, so I cleaned all the carpets, including underneath and behind furniture, and vacuumed off all the furniture.  I have two cats and a guinea pig so my apartment is covered in pet hair.  I had just vacuumed two days earlier with my old vacuum, yet the Bissell still removed 4 canisters full of pet hair from the carpet and one canister full from the furniture.  My carpets have not looked this good since the day I moved into my apartment.  The on board attachments are perfect for cleaning furniture and reaching small spaces in between furniture.  I highly recommend this vacuum for all pet owners.

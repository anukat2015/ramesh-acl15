Title: Works great
Content:
This laptop works great right.  It worked great out of the box.  I have been using it daily for about a month and it still works great.  No problems at all.
A couple reviews said they had trouble seeing the keyboard letters.  I have no idea what their problem is.  I can see the letters fine.  Of course, most people (including me) type by touch, but when I saw those reviews I looked and the letters on the keyboard are EASY TO READ.

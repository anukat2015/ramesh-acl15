Title: heats nicely but trips my circuit breaker!
Content:
This heater works fine to take the chill off of a cold room, and the remote and oscillation are nice features, but I have had it trip a circuit breaker TWICE in the week that I have had it.  No, I don't have a really old house... it was built in 1978.  The first time, I plugged the vacuum into the same outlet.  Ok, so that's a no-no.  Not a big deal.  After having it running (on high) for several hours plugged into a different outlet, however, it tripped the breaker AGAIN (and I had to go into the freezing cold garage to reset it).
I guess if I just needed to run it for an hour or two, it would be great... but there ought to be something to shut the heater off before it trips the whole breaker for my family room and kitchen!

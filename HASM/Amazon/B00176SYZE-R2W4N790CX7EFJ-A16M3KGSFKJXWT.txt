Title: GREAT CHOICE
Content:
I am very pleased with my choice to purchase a COBY player.  This is the first mp3 player I have purchased for myself. Two of my children have ipod's and I have spent a fortune on buying music for them. With the 4GB COBY player I was able to use Windows Media Player (much easier to use) to load all of my favorite CD's onto the player with room to spare.  I have about 40 CD's on it now and have only used a little over 1GB.  Also I am not limited to using i-tunes for downloads from the internet. 
I found the player easy to use and I like the lightweight sleek feel.
The next time I am in the market to buy an MP3 player I will defiantly purchase a COBY player.

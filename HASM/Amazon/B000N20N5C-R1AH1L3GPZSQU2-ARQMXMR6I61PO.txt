Title: AMazon shipped wrong item 2x
Content:
When I purchased this, amazon was the seller. They shipped it very quickly however they sent the model without the fan option. I contacted them and they sent another right away...but the same thing happened again. I got the heater quickly, but it wasn't the model advertised as it had no fan. I can't say how it works because I've never received the correct item. From what I can tell, it would be great- but with the fan to circulate the heated air. I HATE having to return things!!! Yet another trip to the post office.....waste of my time.

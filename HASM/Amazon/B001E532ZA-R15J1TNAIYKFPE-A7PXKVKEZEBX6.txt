Title: Great Machine
Content:
I bought this machine for my father because he drinks alot of coffee and this was an easy way for him to make decaf at night when my mother didn't want to make an entire pot. My fiance wanted one for Christmas and we got the machine with two packages of Starbucks coffee and two mugs which was cool.  It makes coffee in a few minutes and you can add more if you need too.  You can either put it in a small cup or you can use your travel mug.  They also make a low fat latte package which I appreciate since I am trying to watch my weight.  Its easy to use and you only have to fill up the water container once in a while depending on how often you use it and even then, it still only takes a few moments. We have tried the cappuccinos, lattes, tea, coffee and hot chocolate and all of them are great! I am really pleased with the performance of this machine and would recommend it to anyone.

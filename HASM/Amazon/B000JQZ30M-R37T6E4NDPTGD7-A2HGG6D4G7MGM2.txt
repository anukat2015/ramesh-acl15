Title: Looks fabulous, works great!!
Content:
I was instantly sold on this heater on its looks alone. I did not care about features, I just wanted a piece of equipment that would be reliable, look good, and do the job. After reading the product overview and then the customer reviews, I could not click the purchase button fast enough! Now that it has arrived, I am even more impressed with item.
I must say, be sure to look at the dimensions of this item, I did not and was very surprised by how small this heater is. I was expecting something much larger, however, it worked out well because I just placed the heater on the dresser top and it blends right into the room. It comes already assembled, just open the box, plug in, and turn it on and PRESTO... instant heat! The controls are easy to understand and utilize. I quickly came to love the temperature set option. Just select the desired temperature. And it takes care of the rest. The oscillation was not a selling point for me, it is a nice touch to help disperse the heat slightly, but I use the ceiling fan in the room to keep the air evenly warm... no hot spots, no cold spot. One last word... QUIET! You barely hear this thing at all and what you do hear is just a low white noise, which may contribute to better sleep, but certainly will not interfere with television viewing.
It has become a part of the room's decor instead of an object to trip over or get in the way.

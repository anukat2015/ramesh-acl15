Title: Nice and cozy
Content:
My office is always very cold in the winter. The heat is never regulated properly and being on a basement level makes it worse. So I bought this heater hoping it would help take the chill out of the room and it did that and more. It really made the room warm and toasty, even to the point where I had to turn down the heat. But the smart energy control does help regulate the temps very well and it is also quiet enough that it doesnt bother my patients. It is also very lightweight so easy to transport back and forth

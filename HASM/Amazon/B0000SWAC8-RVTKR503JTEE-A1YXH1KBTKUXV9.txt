Title: Best on the Market!
Content:
This is the third vacuum we've bought in the last 4 years, and we finally found a winner!  With 4 dogs, constant teenager traffic in and out and a combination of hardwood and tile floors and carpeted areas, this  vacuum excels at everything.  It has tremendous suction, it's lightweight and has attachments for every need.  You can't go wrong with this vacuum.

Title: The best
Content:
What can I say,I love this coffee maker.I have had many machines through the years,this is my first programmable one. Super easy to program,the glass pot dosnt drip all over the place like most of the other makers I have owned.Looks great, works great,coffee is very hot and good.The lid opens wide to pour the water in and to put the filter and coffee in.Best part is the coffee is ready when I roll out of bed ,what else can I say, love this crazy thing!!Plus free shipping and a great price.

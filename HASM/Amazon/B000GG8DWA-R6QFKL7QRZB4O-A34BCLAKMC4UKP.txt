Title: decent heater if you sit close enough
Content:
I saw the great reviews, and thought this would be a good option. 
It takes about 10 minutes to get warmed up.
Will project heat a very limited distance, maybe 3 feet.  Over time, it could make a sealed off room warmer than the rest of a home.  Definitely not going to heat a large space.

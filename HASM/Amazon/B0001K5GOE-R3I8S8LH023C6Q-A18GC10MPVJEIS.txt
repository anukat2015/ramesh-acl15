Title: so far so good
Content:
I've had our Dyson for about 3 months now so I can't comment on reliability. What we have noticed is much less dust accumulates on the furniture compared to our old vacuum. It has powerful suction, stores easily and very compact. Contrary to some reviews, we find the cord length of the cord to be adequate at over 21 feet. I was skeptical due to the fact that the beater bar is powered by the vacuum suction and not by  a belt driven motor but you can see that it's spinning very fast and works good on our carpet.My wife likes the on board attachments and says they work well on the furniture and curtains and are easy to change.It's easy to remove and empty the dirt storage compartment and we like not having to change messy paper bags. The only thing that is somewhat of a drawback is that it is a little tipsy if you try to pull it from side to side but not that much of a problem.

Title: Archos 7 is filled with minor disappointments.....as usual
Content:
First off keep in mind that I have the new 7 320gb, the 504 160 gb, and the 605 160gb and  regularly update the firmware and plugins when needed, rarely leave their docking station in the house and I take care of them as if they were part of my family. As a long time companion of Archos products I can't help but be a little bit disappointed over the years by not only the udderly awful and I do mean "AWFUL" customer service but also the annoyance of costs of all the extra plug-ins, quite often enough unresponsiveness of the touch screen and the recognition of numerous songs that I know damn well are in the same exact format as every other song on my player(I think that is just a glitch as I had the same problem with my 504 and 605). I know I'm storing and categorizing my genre, songs, artist and albums just right as I am the most anal person when it comes to my music being categorized just right. ARCHOS PRODUCTS ARE ALSO VERY VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO STATIC SHOCK AS I'VE HAD TO RETURN MY 504 AFTER ONLY HAVING IT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND HAD TO SHELL OUT $197 FOR A NEW HARD DRIVE AND THEY TRIED GETTING ME FOR A BATTERY THEY SAID WASN'T WORKING THOUGH I KNOW IT WAS FOR $60 WHEN BATTERIES ARE ONLY $30 ON THE ARCHOS WEBSITE AND THE HARDDRIVES YOU CAN BY FOR ONLY $65 FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES ONLINE. TheY get you with the labor to install these things, once again I say, "ARCHOS CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL"! I was a little nervous about installing the hard drive myself so I shelled out the $197 for it but I installed the battery myself as it takes a second to snap on.
     A few months ago I purchased the new 7 along with all the plug-ins and I have to say I'm quite impressed by how it looks and what it could do but at the same time the touch response it....well touchie, it will go to files that I didn't even touch, and once you start filling up the hard drive it's lags quite a bit when going from page to page within the music folders. 
Pros:Massive 320gb hard drive (come on people, this is the biggest out now in mp3 players, you could never have to much storage)!
     Screen is a nice clean finish with great picture as usual.
     external speakers on the 7 is incredible.
     internet is rather quick
     stylish
     removable rechargable battery
     drag and drop capabilities
     touch screen
     
Cons:The ridiculous price!
     Touch screen is not responsive at times
     Touch screen doesn't go where you want it to at times(sometimes it will go to a totally different folder)
      Archos customer service is terrible, (if you even get in touch with them)
      Shelling out another $30-$50 for the plug-ins to play various formats when it should play all formats out the box.
      Very sensitive to static shock (which means that even the slightest static shock can ruin the hard drive as it did mine where archos will charge you insane amounts to repair it.)
      The new gens of Archos don't automatically update music files as they did on passed models, you need to do it manually in the settings area of the new models though the video files will automatically update.
      Adding on accessories to your new models will be quite a bit of moola.
      
All said and done I would have to give the new Archos 7 320gb 3 stars specifically because the old problems from passed touch screen models would be fixed on the new models and we are all sure they have been brought to the Archos peoples attention and still no luck with getting those little qliches fixed. Archos customer service is awful as said over and over again. I would honestly have to say that when I'm in the market for a new personal media player or mp3 player that I will look elsewhere as I've still got a bad taste in my mouth from months ago when I needed to get repairs done on my 504. BIG BIG BIG WORD OF ADVICE! IF YOU TOTALLY DISREGARD ANYTHING AND/OR EVERYTHING I'VE WRITTEN HERE PLEASE TAKE THIS WORD OF ADVICE WITH YOU, MAKE SURE YOU GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, AT LEAST 3 OR 4 YEARS. I didn't and I payed for it!

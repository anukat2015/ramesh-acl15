Title: Care & feeding of your Shark
Content:
This vacuum is AWESOME!  Usually problems with a rechargeable battery dying early can be avoided...here is how to get maximum power and performance out of your Shark:
- Charge the vac for 24 HOURS without disturbing it when you first get it.  Don't be tempted to 'try it out' when you first get it in the mail, or after a few hours of charging.
- Deplete the motor COMPLETELY -- if you can't find enough stuff to vacuum, then turn it on and set it on your counter until it dies.  This only takes a few minutes.  Put it back on its charger and charge it again FULLY (at least 12 hours) after depleting it.  Do this THREE TIMES IN A ROW when you first get your vac!  Very important...charge, deplete, charge, deplete, charge, deplete, charge.
- Contrary to Shark's manual, do NOT just replace the vac on its charger whenever you use it for a quick job.  ONLY PUT IT BACK ON ITS CHARGER WHEN IT IS DEPLETED.  My vac has AWESOME power after a solid year of heavy use!
- Rinse both the Hepa filter AND the "nose" part, because sometimes dirt and hair will clog the flapper device inside the nose.  [Hint: You can still charge your vac while the "nose" of it (the clear grey part the filter fits into) is off!]  
Happy vacuuming...hope this helps!  :-)

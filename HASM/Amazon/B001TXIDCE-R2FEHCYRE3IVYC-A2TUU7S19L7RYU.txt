Title: So far, great
Content:
First read this: I am not one of the professional photographers who've reviewed this camera here at Amazon.  Rather, I'm an amateur travel photo enthusiast who enjoys recording my trips.  With that said, during a recent trip to Europe, I shot excellent day, night, dusk, and indoor flash-less shots with this camera--all of which turned out marvelous.  I really need some photography education, but even without any, I figured out how to shoot some proud photos with this easy-to-use camera. 
The camera design is excellent, the construction is sturdy, and the 2 lenses fill all my needs.  Any criticisms I might include would be a slightly unresponsive Menu button (sometimes after being depressed, the screen only lights for a moment, requiring a 2nd push.  A 2 GB memory card held about 600 photos taken at full file size (no complaints, I'd never exceed that on a trip).  Battery life was not a problem.  After about 300 shots, it required re-charging, but only because I took so many trial photos with the flash.  The art filters are fun, too.  Don't even bother with the software, that always sucks, and you don't need it anyways to upload the photos to your computer.  I have no regrets with buying this camera.  Should it go south on me, I'll revise this review.  Good luck!

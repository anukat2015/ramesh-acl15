Title: Faulty Design
Content:
Loved the compact little vacuum cleaner, but soon found out that the engineers must have made a mistake in the design. The hose continuous to clog up and it is impossible to clear. We have now assembled sticks, hangers and other tools to continue clearing it after every second usage. Sorry to say I wish I had a different vacuum.

Title: Photographer's Workhorse
Content:
If you're serious about photography, this is a camera you will really be happy with. Not really for the point-and-shoot person (although you can leave it in Programmed Auto mode for great pictures with no further adjustment). What sets it apart as a semi-professional tool is the ability to quickly adjust shooting parameters through external controls on the camera rather than wading through multiple menus to get what you want, as well as added features such as auto bracketing and virtually limitless control over almost all of the camera's performance features.
    Add to this the magnesium frame and dust sealing, 3D metering and the ability to auto-focus many of the older Nikon lenses (for those stepping into digital from the film world) and you have a solid camera for the serious photographer.
    There are newer models (the D300 and the soon-to-be announced D400) but the D200s are currently going for less than half their price a few years ago. Prices on equipment of this quality are continually rising, so if you can find one for a good price and are willing to spend a little time learning how to use it's full capabilities, this camera represents a great value.
    Don't get caught up in the megapixel wars - the pictures from this camera will amaze you with their quality all the way up to huge enlargements.

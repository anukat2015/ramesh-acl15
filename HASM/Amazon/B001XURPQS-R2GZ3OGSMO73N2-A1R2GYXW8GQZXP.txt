Title: Great Camera
Content:
The Canon T1i is an exceptional camera.  I own both the 50D and the T1i.  I bought the camera for my wife as an introduction to DSLR and I find my self using it as much as she does. Although there is a great deal of work to be done on the focusing during video capture feature, Canon has raised the bar pretty high for an entry level unit.

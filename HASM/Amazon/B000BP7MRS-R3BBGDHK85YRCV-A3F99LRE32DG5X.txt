Title: Great product for the price
Content:
I received this over Christmas so it's been use for about a month. The design is sharp and is compact for tight counter spaces. Brewing is very fast, much faster than my previous cheaper Mr. Coffee. I use the Brita filter even though I already use filtered water. I figure filtering the water twice can't be a bad thing? The gold-toned filter works great. It makes a very good tasting coffee. The coffee does come out hot, much hotter than my previous coffeemaker. But don't leave it on the hot plate for too long. It doesn't keep the coffee hot very well. You'll have to make sure you're drinking coffee right after it's made. Another negative is the way you open the filter basket. Oftentimes, it gets stuck and I'll have to physically open it even when pressing the button. I've noticed that weight may be an issue. It opens fine when filed with used coffee grinds but when empty, it has problems.
My conclusion is that for the price, you can't go wrong. I can't comment on how it works compared to much pricier models but I did research those pretty extensively. I decided that it wasn't worth the extra $100 or more bucks. This product does the job and it does it well.

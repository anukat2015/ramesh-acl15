Title: Dissapointing - Returned it for an iPod. :(
Content:
I was initially very excited about this player - seemed like a pretty sweet product, but after getting mine and spending a few days using the messy and incongruent software, i started to get annoyed. iTunes is okay, but now that i've used microsoft's version, i'm realizing that iTunes is really good in comparison.
The breaking point, though, was that the controls on this thing are just BAD. The interface is flashy and looks neat, but usability-wise, this thing is lame. I can't even skip tracks while in the menu because the skip buttons are used to change my view from albums to artists etc. 
I thought this fancy new interface would be an upgrade, but it turned out to only be a change for the worse. While i have to admit that the visuals on the zune's interface were neato, and makes my new ipod's interface look a little boring, the iPod actually gets stuff done much quicker, and acts like i expect it to (like i was Hoping the zune would, but fails to deliver.)
Also, the wireless thing is useless, and i dont much like the music store. 
My new iPod might not seem as as fancy, but it's smaller, better looking, and works like you expect it to. 
I'll check out the next Zune, but this one is a PASS.

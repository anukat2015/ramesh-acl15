Title: Faux Fire is simply Fabulous
Content:
OK, so I was a little skeptical about buying the electric fireplace thingy.  The doubts?  It might look fakey, I wouldn't like the flames, it wouldn't put out any heat.
Wrong, wrong, and wrong.  I am in LOVE with this product.  I use it almost every day, and people who come over just cannot believe it's not real. One friend is replacing her gas logs after seeing my fireplace.  One click of the remote, and you have a fire going.  To be honest, I still don't understand how this works on a light bulb.  The logs seem to glow, there are little embers that appear to be burning, and the flames dance around just like a real fire.
Oh Dimplex designers and engineers....I don't know how you did it, but you did.  For $170 and free shipping (thank you Amazon!) I now have a cozy living room that I enjoy reading or watching TV in.  This is truly an amazing product.
I guess you can tell I give it my highest recommendation!

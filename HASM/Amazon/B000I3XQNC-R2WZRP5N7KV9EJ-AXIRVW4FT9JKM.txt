Title: Excellent Camera....excellent support!
Content:
I finally moved up to a DSLR and am very pleased with the quality of this particular camera.  A friend has a Pentax DSLR (older) and the pictures the XTi produces are much nicer than his.  The Canon is much sharper.  I was missing something out of the box and called Canon and was on the phone with a live person within 30 seconds.  My missing part was at my door in 4 days.  Their customer service is top-notch. I was leary at first purchasing this camera because of the price but I plan keeping it for a very long time and so far so good...it does everything I want and then some.  I've read some negative comments about the included lens, but I see no issues so far with that either.  It takes some getting used in hand because of its smaller body than other DSLR's I held, but that seems better now as well (after about 40-50 shots).

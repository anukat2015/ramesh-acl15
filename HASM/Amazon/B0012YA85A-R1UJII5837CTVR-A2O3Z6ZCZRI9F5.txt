Title: Not completely satisfied
Content:
I use a Sony and Nikon digital cameras, as well as the Canon.  The Canon takes wonderful photos, but using the Canon software is cumbersome.  it will not work with my HP desktop, but will with my laptop.  However, I do not like the Canon  software ease of opoeration.  If I knew the difficulty of using it, prior to purchase, it would have seriously influenced my non-purchase of this camera.

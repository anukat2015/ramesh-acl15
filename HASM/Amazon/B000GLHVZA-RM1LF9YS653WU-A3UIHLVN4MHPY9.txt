Title: Expensive and safe, but not effective
Content:
For $100, I expected it to be twice as good as my other $50 space heaters.  But it isn't.  It puts out warm (not hot) air and seems to keep the temperature in my 20' x 20' living room at about 64°.  If I'm lucky, the temperature will rise very slowly by one degree about every 30 minutes.  But it never gets much past 64°.  
I did find that if I blast the oven for a while and keep this heater on, the house gets to 68° and stays there.  I guess the trick is that this type of heater doesn't really heat a room, but rather maintains the temperature of an already warm room.

Title: Good but not great
Content:
The camera is indeed very good and after about 2000 pictures I'm happy I bought it however with the standard kit lens I find very difficult to focus on lower light. Also the quality and the clarity of the pictures taken with kit lens can be improved. The filter is very good to protect the lens from scratches or other unexpected events. I recommend buying the 50mm f/1.8 prime lens with this camera especially for new comers to dslr cameras.

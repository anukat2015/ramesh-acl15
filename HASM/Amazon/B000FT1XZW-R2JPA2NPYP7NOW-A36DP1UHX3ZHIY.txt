Title: great heater, very quiet
Content:
This little heater works well!  The snap-down wheels made it very easy to install (no assembly required).  The thermostatic variable control works well (unlike some others I have tried).  Some reviewers reported smelling an oil or paint smell when they first turned it on, however, I did not have that issue at all.  Since I only obtained my heater at the end of this years heating season, I haven't yet fully tested the high heat setting, but on the low setting, it kept my 20 x 14 foot room quite comfortable this spring.  It makes no noise that I have been able to tell, except a very slight click when the heater turns on at the thermostat setting.

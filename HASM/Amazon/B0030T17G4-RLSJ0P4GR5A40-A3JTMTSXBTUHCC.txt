Title: The mouse pad is absolutely useless!
Content:
Hey Guys, 
I bought this directly from Dell, The good things are:
Very  light weight - very easy to carry around everywhere
Very thin - Unless you are comparing it to macbook air or something like that, its extremely thin. 
Very Fast - the I3 processor is very fast
Here are the negatives:
First and FOREMOST - the mouse pad(or finger pad, whatever you would call it) is nto very practical, if your hands have even a bit of moisture or sweat, the mousepad wont respond well. In fact it is so painful that It makes the computer very much less productive than my previous laptop. 
The keyboard also seems very crammed.

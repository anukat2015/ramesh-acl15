Title: Seksee looking laptop for hot price!
Content:
The laptop looks very nice and well designed. The colot scheme with silver/carbon black is great. The keyboard is well laid out. The fan isn't noisy and mobile Athlon is great!Battery life is in excess of 3 hrs and laptop doesn't get hot either. The LCD is good and has good range of viewing angle. The warranty support from Compaq is better than HP, atlhough both are same companies now. If you want blue scheme instead of silver try the HP ZE4200 series and its same hardware as Compaq.The prices are low in most local stores than Amazon. Kudos to HP/Compaq for designing such low cost and fully functional laptop.

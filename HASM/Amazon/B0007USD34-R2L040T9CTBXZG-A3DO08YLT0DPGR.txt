Title: An asset for a photographer
Content:
There are fine reviews already written about this product. All of them are true from my experience. This is simply a great product and a great price.
A strong body, amazing picture quality, very less delay in transferring images to the storage. The leses come with the camera is good enough for most of the cases.
There is a lot to learn, which is same in most of the SLR cameras. But this camera gives several pre programmed options which is good for starters.
I had difficulty taking portraints indoor. That may be the only thing which worries me. But I found this is common in many cameras. It requires appropritae lighting.
Also do not buy this camers to take indoor (birthday, parties etc..) photography. Use point and shoot cameras for that.... But outdoor, this one is truly a great camera.

Title: Died after 3 1/2 months
Content:
A previous poster mentioned that Vornado only has a 30 day warranty period. They actually have a 1 year warranty, not 30 days.
That being said, my Vornado died after only 3 1/2 months. I only use it at night (12 hours) and it's set on low at 68-70. They have been very gracious and are paying for me to send it back to them and they will pay to send it back but I am without a heater in my daughter's nursery for the 3 weeks it's going to take to ship, fix, and ship. I was not offered a loaner during that time. I don't know what I'm going to do, since it's still very cold here and by the time I get it back it will be Spring.
I'm very disappointed that it died so quickly, but very impressed with the Customer Service. I hope it's fixed when it comes back. 
I guess I'm still on the fence about it.

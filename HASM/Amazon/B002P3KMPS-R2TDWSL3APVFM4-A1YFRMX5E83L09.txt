Title: Very happy with this machine
Content:
I recently purchased this laptop, and have been very happy so far.  Very fast performance and outstanding video display.  I've read that ASUS has the lowest return rates of any laptop, and I'm not surprised.  The machine stays very cool and does not seem to overheat.  I've only had this a short time but have been using it heavily, and am very happy with it.
I haven't tested the battery all the way through, but I'm guessing from other comments that the battery life is probably indeed inside of 2 hours.  Truthfully, that's not an issue for me.  Maybe it is for others, but I don't fly much and don't have a need to work without a power source for several hours.
If you are looking for a strong desktop replacement and want to spend under $900, this is the laptop to get.
The keyboard takes a little getting used to, but something tells me it might be sturdier than keyboards on prior laptops I've owned.
This is an outstanding machine.

Title: bad company back-up
Content:
I don't have much of an opinion about the vacuum cleaner, except the hose rips quickly and without having been abused; HOWEVER, I have been waiting for six weeks for a simple fix to this problem. Since my vacuum cleaner was still under warrantee, I took it to an authorized dealer to have the hose replaced. They cannot replace the part until it is shipped. Hoover is now owned by Dirt Devil. I was told by the repair shop manager that Dirt Devil is notorious for delays. Whether they do not want to honor the warrantee and are trying for me to give up by attrition or are merely inefficient, I do not know, but I am never buying a Hoover or Dirt Devil product again.

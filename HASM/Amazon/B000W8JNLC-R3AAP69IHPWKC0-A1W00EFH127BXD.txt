Title: The Big Bertha stove does the job
Content:
I purchased the Big Bertha stove to fire up a large (7 quart jar capacity) pressure cooker for canning. Upon arrival, the stove was banged around during shipping and did not sit level upon a flat surface. I was able to file down the offending leg slightly and now it sits rock solid level. In operation, this stove gets hellishly hot, it can boil a full pot of water in minutes.   The 6 ft gas hose is rather sticky and smells of plastic resins and chemicals. This stove works well, has a full range of adjustment and puts out sufficent heat for pressure canning purposes. You can set a large pot on this unit with the controls being accessable.

Title: Lovin' it
Content:
I've only previously owned a 4th gen 40GB iPod, so I can't comment on the 'downgrade' issues from the last generation iPods, but so far I am very, very happy with my new 80GB classic.  Installation was a breeze.  I already had iTunes set up with all my music, so all I had to do was load up iTunes and plug in the iPod, and automation took care of the rest.  The iPod charged up in a few hours.  That simple!
The 80GB classic is perfect for what I use it for: listening to my entire music collection from one convienent place.  I've been listening to it for many many hours straight, and it's barely even touched the battery.  The screen is nice and vibrant for looking at all the cover art, and the backlight auto shuts off to save on batteries when you aren't using it, especially useful when it's just sitting in your pocket or glovebox.  The brushed aluminum looks very stylish and gives it a more solid feel.  The clickwheel can be a little sluggish at times, but I've never found myself irritated by it.
All in all an excellent purchase.  Extremely impressed by the battery life.  I'm glad I waited a little longer to buy an iPod, as we now get 80GB of storage instead of 30GB for the same price.

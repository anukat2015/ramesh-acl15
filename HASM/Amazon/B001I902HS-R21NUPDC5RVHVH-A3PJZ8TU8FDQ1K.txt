Title: Not great on hardwood; needs a couple more adjustable tools
Content:
Our house has hardwood floors so this vacuum posed a challenge, especially since the large head was difficult to navigate in tight corners and around furniture (but it did flatten well under the beds).
Two years ago, my wife bought the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum for $195 on Amazon. Both the Hoover and the Panasonic OptiFlow feature a 12-Amp motor, a HEPA filter and retractable power cords but the Panasonic sells for $125 more.
After several trials, my wife put the Panasonic in the back room and returned to the Hoover. Here's why she still prefers the Hoover:
  1. The Hoover offers three-stage suction control that can be adjusted from the handle.
  2. The Hoover has an adjustable extension wand that is easy to use.
  3. The Hoover doesn't have a bag. The HEPA filter can be washed, which saves us money by not buying additional bags and filters.
  4. The Hoover includes a tile floor head that works better on hardwood floors.
However, the Panasonic OptiFlow's 14-inch nozzle worked better on area rugs and the dusting brush did a fine job on the blinds. Another positive feature is that the vacuum canister can be stored upright, a real space saver.
Additionally, the Panasonic performs quieter than the Hoover, so keep that in mind if noise is important (for example, if you are vacuuming with a sleeping baby in the house).
Overall, the Panasonic OptiFlow earns a three-star rating, deducting one star to reflect the points listed above and the other star to reflect the higher price versus the Hoover model.

Title: What a Pain
Content:
The machine is tempremental at best - it would not use my preferred pre-ground expresso.  But it worked ok with ground beans a bit more course.  Then, I broke my glass coffee carafe - my fault, I'll buy a replacement. Replacements do not come with lids.  As the lid was attached to the broken glass, I had thrown it away.  Krups will sell a replacement lid, but won't have it in for a month or so.  Machine does not work without the lid.  I have used Krups machines for 15+ years - never again.  My $ is going towards a new Mr. Coffee.

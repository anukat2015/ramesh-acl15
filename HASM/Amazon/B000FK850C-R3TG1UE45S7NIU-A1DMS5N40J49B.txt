Title: SPT- SH-1508 Tower Heater. Good heater for small rooms.
Content:
This tower ceramic heater is made of durable, but lightweight plastic material and does a very good job at heating small to medium rooms. This product is designed for smaller areas and has many features that make it worth buying.
It has a auto temp feature, oscillation which spreads the heat during operation, auto timers, a fan, an Ionizer and a easy to read blue LCD read-out. The blue LCD display turns off after several seconds. It also comes with a remote control.
Since buying this heater, I've used it for the last few months and it has heated very well for small to medium sized rooms. It is worth the price and has many features you can use.

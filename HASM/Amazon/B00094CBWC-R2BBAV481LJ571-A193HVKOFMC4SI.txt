Title: VERY QUIET! Heats well, controls could be better
Content:
This is the quietest space heater ever. Truly quiet (you don't know it's on) and it does heat very well. The thermostat is fine/good (not great), and the controls require you to step through all settings to arrive at the setting desired. I'm here on Amazon looking for a second one - so I do recommend this heater, even if the controls aren't 100% perfect. If you need quiet and warm, this is a fine choice.

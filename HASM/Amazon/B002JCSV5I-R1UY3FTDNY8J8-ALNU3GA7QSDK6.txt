Title: Outstanding Value & GREAT Camera
Content:
Wanted to upgrade from simple point & shoot to get DSLR quality; D3000 delivers! Amazon price of $459 was great value; picture quality is outstanding. Even for an amateur, the camera is very forgiving; can easily picked up & used by anyone. The AUTO mode makes it extremely easy to use and get the photo you want. I also bought a Speedlight 600 to go with the D3000; the flash helps to create GREAT lighting and wonderful family photos.  For the price, you can't beat the simplicity and quality of the D3000.

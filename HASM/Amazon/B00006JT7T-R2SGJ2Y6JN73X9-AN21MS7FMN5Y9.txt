Title: needs more fan power
Content:
Nice heater with good features. The thermostat and timer featurea work well. The problem is that the heat comes out of the three sided front, and the air is drawn in through a 4 inch diameter hole in the back. The fan does not push the air out into the room. Good for a small room like a bathroom, but not for a lager application.

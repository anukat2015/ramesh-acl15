Title: A great DSLR for the price
Content:
I purchased one of these about a month ago along with a 55-200mm second lens. I started my photography hobby "back in the day" of developing my own film, doing my own color and B&W prints, etc. and loved my old film-based Nikon and RIcoh cameras. But as my life got busier with family etc I let that hobby go. But with the advent of digital cameras with good quality and good apps for computer editing I got back into. At first with the lower end cameras like a Canon G2 and Powershot models. They were convenient but photo quality wasn't that good and they struggled with many tougher situations. Plus my hold SLR hobbiest self objected to the lack of creative control. With the newer DSLRs that are available around $600 I took another look and felt the features and quality were ready for purchase decision. After comparing with the XTi from Canon I selected the Nikon because I found it's features easier to use and comprehensive. And most important the quality of the images is superior to the Canon. Canon's consumer lenses just aren't very good (at least not compared to Nikon). While I see some people are dinging this camera for sports I've had good luck using it for action shots. Unless you are considering buying a lens above 300mm I don't think the lack of in-body AF is going to be much of a real concern. Now, on to the best feature. In my tests the Nikon absolutely smokes in the Canon in start up time. With the Nikon, you can take a picture IMMEDIATELY after turning the D40x on. This is a huge feature for me and one of the reasons I wanted a DSLR. Also, the multishot mode works very well in capturing action. I'm really happy with this camera for the price!

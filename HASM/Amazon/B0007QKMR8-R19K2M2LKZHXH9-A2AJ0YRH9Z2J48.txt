Title: Canon Digital Rebel XT masterpiece
Content:
I've had this camera for some time now and it continues to impress! I go to car shows, sporting events, races, etc. and this camera can handle it all awesome. It may be a little pricey for some, but you get what you pay for. I have a 6GB card with it and went to the Detroit Auto Show and didn't even use hardly any of the memory on the card(and I took well over 450 pics). The pics are very clear with minimal or no distortion at all. I've been reviewing pics of the auto show all over the internet and my pics still seem clearer and more vibrant than any I've seen from any professional or otherwise that have them posted online. This thing is THE best camera I've ever used and I would strongly recommend it any day!

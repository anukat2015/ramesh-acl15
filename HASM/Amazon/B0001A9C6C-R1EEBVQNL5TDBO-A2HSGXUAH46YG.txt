Title: Not bad! If you like to spend more than it's worth...
Content:
Not bad but don't get suckered into the hype. These iPod are extremely commercialized. What they fail to mention is when the batteries for these "wonderful" iPods have completely lost their charge you have to send it back to MAC to have the battery replaced. The batteries are meant to last about as long as a rechargeable cordless phone. 1-3 years max. Than it's off to MAC for a battery replacement fee and shipping charges. So do try to estimate how much you are willing to spend. 
Software issues: try not to speed through your MP3 collection like you would when pressing the button too fast on a CD player. The iPod will lock and you're stuck performing an "unfreeze command" that I'm sure is listed with other reviews. (Press & Hold both MENU and PLAY till the iPod resets). 
By the way, I don't recommend the remote unless you're interested in purchasing that same remote every 3-6 months, since that's how long it takes to break down.
My advise: All technologies improves. I'd say to wait it out and soon a better, less bugged version comes out. Or just enjoy spending your money on this one and enjoy it while it lasts! And of course, wear it like an accessory to show you have wealth. 
Personal question: Why'd I buy it?? 
Answer: It was a gift, that I greatly appreciate and will continue to love!! I'll just have to invest in it from time to time.

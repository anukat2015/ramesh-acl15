Title: Really works!
Content:
This heater works so well that it's the only heat I use -- even on cold winter days in New England. 
I put it next to the computer when I'm writing and it keeps me warm at (if my arithmetic is right) 20 cents an hour for the electricity.
It wouldn't heat a large space -- but it's light enough to carry around, and if I close the doors of whatever room I'm in, I stay warm.
The only thing I don't like about it is its looks....but for $50, you can't have everything and it does the job.

Title: little workhorse...
Content:
Well, it's lightweight.  I can carry it from room to room in a small 1 br apartment where I don't think the heat works. So this little workhorse has saved me. I have had to turn it on or off myself though, as I really doubt the "thermostat" really should be called that. It's not automatic. It does warm up the room fairly well, though. I tried to find something NOT made in China because DeLonghi is an Italian company, but no such luck - it's still made in China. Found it at Frye's for $20, worth it.

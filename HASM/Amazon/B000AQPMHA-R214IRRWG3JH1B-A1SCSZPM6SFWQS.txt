Title: Not my cup of coffee
Content:
I bought this for my wife as a gift just over a month ago and she has used it every day since.  It seems to be well made and works as advertised.  It takes up more room than most other single cup coffee makers, and makes quite a bit of noise when it's brewing, but it doesn't last long and I don't find it a problem.
That's the good news.  The bad news is that despite all the flavors available there are none I would rate as outstanding.  The machine came with several flavors and my wife immediately ordered every variety pack she could find.  Since then I have tried over 30 different flavors and one thing has become abundantly clear:  for those who like strong coffee, this is definitely not for you.  For Keurig, bold is nothing more than a four-letter word for bitter, the more exotic flavors are weak and disappointing, and the medium roasts are nothing more than dark tea if you make the larger size.
The bottom line is that if you are a coffee connoisseur then avoid this one.  It's trendy and most definitely convenient, but if you go this way you will sacrifice flavor.  Like so many good technologies dumbed-down for mass production this one falls short.

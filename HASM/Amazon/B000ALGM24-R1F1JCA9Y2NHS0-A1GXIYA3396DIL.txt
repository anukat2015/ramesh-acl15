Title: An outstanding thermostat
Content:
I purchased the Hunter 44550 thermostat to replace another brand, which no longer cycled from day-to-day.  The Hunter has lived up to the reputation of the company.  The 44550 provides four setting per day for the entire week; it is actually used in my church.  I have set the programming to maintain a minimum temperature during the days when no one is present, and then to maintain the heating/cooling when there are services.
I would definitely recommend this thermostat for anyone needing this type of control for your house, or business....JimMc

Title: Hose and heater do not work
Content:
.
In December 2004 I purchased a  Mr Heater MH18B Portable Heater
and this hose to connect to a propane storage conatainer.
.
The hose inserts into the tank and the heater smoothly. But no
propane flows from the tank to the heater. I have been unable
to get even the pilot flame to light ... no gas flow through
to the heating element
.
A wasted $150 .... not a very happy or satisfied customer
.

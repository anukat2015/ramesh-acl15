Title: Very impressive camera
Content:
I've had my 40D for a week.  I'm not going to provide a technical review, as many others have already done a great job at that already.  I appreciate those reviews, as they helped me decide to get this camera.  I'll cut to the point and tell you that this is a great camera.  It can be customized for any individual user, or set to one of it's basic modes for those not interested in the details of photography but who still want amazing pictures.  The first pictures I took, using some of the simplest settings, came out great.  I am also impressed with Canon's software package.  Processing RAW images is very easy.  As someone new to digital SLR photography, I can assure you this camera is well suited to even the novice photographer.  I also purchased a book about the 40D, and am very glad I did.  If you're new to digital photography, having a book to provide some education is a great idea.  That's it, short and sweet.  This camera gets 5 stars.

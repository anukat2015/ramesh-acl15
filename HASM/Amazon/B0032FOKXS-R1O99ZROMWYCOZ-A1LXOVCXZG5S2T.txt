Title: exactly what i was looking for
Content:
Best laptop i have ever owned. I considered buying a macbook pro 13 but after this came back down to $800 i decided to buy this one. I have owned this laptop for over a month and here are my thoughts. 
- Processor- I was worried at first that the ULV 1.3 would not have the guts for my high demands on my (work/play) laptop.  I worried for nothing. This thing is blazing fast.  I was pleasantly surprised.
- Hard drive - I was not very excited about have a pre-partitioned drive to 180 OS and 320 DATA size drives. I prefer to have choose myself if I want partitions.  Although I found the process to fix this issue easier than i could have imagined. I pressed one button during boot up and then choose reinstall OS and remove all partitions using whole drive. a few min later I booted to my OS with no partitions (I almost cried).
- Fingers - my only real complaint with this laptop is that it picks up finger prints like crazy.  haven't found a fix for this yet.  
OTHER THINGS I LOVED
 - screen is really bright - even on low setting
 - Windows can't figure out how long the battery is but finally get to leave my charger at home (charge every other day or so)
 - HDMI out works awesome - but only when I was running the NVIDIA card
Overall I recommend this machine to everyone.  I had to buy an external DVD drive but haven't used it much.

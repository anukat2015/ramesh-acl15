Title: Quick & Easy
Content:
I've had this for over a month and am still excited about it. I love coffee, but didn't make it everyday because of the hassle. Since I got this, I have couple cups a day. There's no mess, nothing to wash afterward (but the cup) and excellent coffee. Guests love choosing which coffee to try. If here are any downfalls to this machine, I haven't found any. My only regret is that I should have purchased the model with more cup size settings.

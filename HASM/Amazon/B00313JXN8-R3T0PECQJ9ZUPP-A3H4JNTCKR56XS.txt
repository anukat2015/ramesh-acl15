Title: Great Laptop
Content:
The computer arrived in great shape. There have been absolutely no problems with this computer.  It is so much faster than my old computer, and the graphics are great.  There is plenty of RAM and plenty of hard drive space. I run some large apps for school projects without any of the problems I had with the old machine.
If I had to find something bad, and it isn't really bad, is the battery life is not as good as I would like, but like so many things, everything is a compromise. If someone was a clean freak, the finger prints will drive them crazy.
Toshiba did a right fine job with the product: A505-S6030.

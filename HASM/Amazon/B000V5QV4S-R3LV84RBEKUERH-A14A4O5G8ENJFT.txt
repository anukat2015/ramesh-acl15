Title: Great product but packaged without any care
Content:
When buying an expensive camera body and lens you expect those items to be packaged well, but they came in a too big cardboard box without any cushioning whatsoever. The camera and lens were of course in their own boxes but they slided around and had almost torn the outer box open.
Luckily the camera was not damaged.

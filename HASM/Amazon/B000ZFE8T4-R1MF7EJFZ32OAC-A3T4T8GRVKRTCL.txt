Title: Breaks right away
Content:
I got one of these and it stopped working within a month. I exchanged it for another one, and that one worked for the few weeks we still needed a heater, but when we pulled it out of storage this year it no longer functioned.  Both had a problem where one of the lights showed red all the time.  The manual indicated that it was a problem only resolvable by sending it in for warranty covered repairs, but I just threw the second one out and resolved not to buy Bionaire in the future.

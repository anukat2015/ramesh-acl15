Title: Great Camera on a Budget
Content:
I got this camera on Ebay with a lens for around $600 bucks - I really wanted the D90 but didn't have the cash. I'm really happy with the quality of the photos from this camera. The portability is great, and it allows me to start building a collection of nikon lenses until I can upgrade. If you're looking for a solid camera on a budget i recommend this one.

Title: Great computer - Great price
Content:
I've had this computer for several months now and I love it.  I selected it because it was a "best buy" selection on Consumer Reports at the time.  It is light and handles all the tasks I need.  I use it a lot for presentations including music, DVDs and Powerpoint.  It replaced my old Dell notebook and performs as well for a lot less.  I use Norton virus protection on it, have not upgraded to Windowa 7 yet and use Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007.  It is my home computer so have not run large spreadsheets requiring lots of processing power.  It has my strong recommendation.

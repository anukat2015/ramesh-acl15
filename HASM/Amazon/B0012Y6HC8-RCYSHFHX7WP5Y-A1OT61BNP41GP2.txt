Title: Great upgrade from 300D
Content:
I had been waiting to upgrade my camera body from the original digital rebel. I had been investing money into lenses. I wanted better indoor performance than my Canon 17-55IS could provide on my 300D, so after looking at how low noise the 450D provided, I got one and have not regretted it.

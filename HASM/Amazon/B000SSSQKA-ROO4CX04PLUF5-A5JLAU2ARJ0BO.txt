Title: Pretty happy with this versatile canister vac
Content:
This is my first canister vac and I've been pretty happy with it. It was bought to replace a Dirt Devil upright that died after a year of occasional use. I wanted something lightweight, and this is only 10 pounds total so it's pretty easy to drag around and carry up the stairs. We have both parquet and rugs, and this vac works equally well on the different types of surfaces, although coming from using only uprights in the past, it took me a while to get used to the "feel". The suction power can be adjusted, which is good because at the max it's sometimes impossible to lift the nozzle off a rug!  I have kids so the HEPA filter on this model is a big plus. I don't mind buying the bags; I will never use another bagless model because they all leak and smell after first use. I now use this vac almost every day and keep our duplex apartment relatively clean for the kids to play in. :)

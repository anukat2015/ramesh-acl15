Title: Liked the vacuum- HATED the vendor
Content:
This is a decent vacuum cleaner for the price. Eureka has definitely gone away from high quality, though- I have an earlier version of this vacuum, about 10 years old. I had to replace it but am still using the hose from the old machine with the new vac. The new hose is flimsy and kinks easily.

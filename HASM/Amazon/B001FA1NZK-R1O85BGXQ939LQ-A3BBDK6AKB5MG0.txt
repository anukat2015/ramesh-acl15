Title: "NEWEST MODEL" doesn't include newest OS
Content:
Even though there is a window explaining that Apple came out with OS3 in June it doesn't say that it's not installed on this item.  The words "NEWEST MODEL" I took to mean that this unit was the newest model with the newest operating system.  Plan on paying $10.00 to do that yourself to get full functionality.  Other than that it was great.  The iPod is very rugged as it came in a small plastic box in a bigger cardboard box without and other packaging.  So I was pleasantly surprised when it all worked.

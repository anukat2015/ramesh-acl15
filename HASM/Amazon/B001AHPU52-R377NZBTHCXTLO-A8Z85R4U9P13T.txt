Title: HAIER WINDOW A/C HWR 12XC8
Content:
The unit is a bit noisier than the other two Haier units that I have, but not annoying.  I have it set so that it turns itself off completely when it reaches temperature, instead of having the fan continue blowing, and that is a great feature.  The unit arrived with some exterior cosmetic damage and, because the vendor would not order the replacement parts, I contacted Haier and found their customer support to be very helpful. My other two units are two years old and operate without a hitch.  
I installed the unit by myself, but recommend and extra pair of hands to put it on the sill.

Title: Very high maintenance PC
Content:
I purchased this PC to use as my working laptop as I travel around to universities.  I charge by the hour for my services, so the goal is to have a PC that is a tool for my trade.
I estimate I have spent over 100 hours of personal and business time in the last year just trying to get this thing to work.  It has also been in the shop twice.  I am on my second hard drive and that one is beginning to fail.  I find I must run Task Manager to monitor for programs that are not responding. (Many times, Task Manager has itself responded with "Not Responding")  
The CPU and hard drive seem to be under a heavy workload even when nothing is running.  I spent many hours reviewing the services and eliminating those that are unnecessary but that has not helped.
I upgraded the RAM to 2Meg, but that did not seem to help much.
I wiped the hard drive clean and reinstalled all software.  That did not help either.
My first car was a VW bug.  I traveled with a tool-box just to be sure I would get from point A to point B and quite often had to use it.  
The same holds true for this PC.  I have used the recovery disk at least 10 times.  I meant to purchase a machine that supported me as I earned my living.  Instead, I am finding I must be a PC mechanic in order to get it to operate on a daily basis.
I almost can laugh at one error:  Even as I struggle to keep this thing up and running, once in a while...for a day or so... the R key doesn't work...
DONT BUY IT!

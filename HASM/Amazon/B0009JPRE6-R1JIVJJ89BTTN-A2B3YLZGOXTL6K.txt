Title: poor manufacutring quality
Content:
At the beginning, I did take some good portraites with this camera. But after 13 month and 800 shots, the following problems emerge:
1.the on/off switch doesn't work.
2.the camera can't read CF card.
3.meter overexpose.
4.loose focusing.
Cost to fix them? $250.00
If you are professional or serious amateur photographer, 
Don't buy this camera just because it's cheap.

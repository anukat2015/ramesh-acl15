Title: Meets Expectations
Content:
Overall, this vacuum is pretty good.  We've had it for a month, and it seems to be comparable to the previous windtunnel we owned (replaced because it died one day).  The suction seems very good and we're impressed with the amount of dirt it picks up.  Just a few downsides: the canister fills up rather quickly because the suction is so hard, loose carpet fibers are constantly being collected; the base doesn't sit well on a step, making the stairs a bit more difficult to clean; and the vacuum doesn't have onboard storage for its extra pieces.

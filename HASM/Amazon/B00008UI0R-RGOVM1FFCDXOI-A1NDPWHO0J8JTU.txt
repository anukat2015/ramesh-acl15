Title: hoover windtunnel electronic bagless vacuum cleaner
Content:
This is my second vacuum of this type. I have had my first for 1 1/2 years and it is still going strong. It takes a little care but it is well worth it. If you empty it and clean the filter with water after each use, the vacuum is awesome. I have had Sears, electrolux and other great brand and none have been as good as this. My husband had purchased the same vacuum  except it was not the electronic one. Mine is better because it has better attachments. I must tell you, though, I do not have carpeting in my house, so I am not going to say how it is for that, but I LOVE THIS VACUUM!!!!!!

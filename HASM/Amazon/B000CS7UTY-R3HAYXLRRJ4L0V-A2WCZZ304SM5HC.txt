Title: Great alternative to iPod
Content:
If want a quality mp3 and video player or you just don't want to be a slave to Apple and iTunes, the Creative Zen is for you. I tried an iPod, not only did it fail to live up to the word of mouth, it failed to work with my brand new HP computer. The Zen Vision M has it all - great functionality, great style, great sound and great extras. It even has a calendar to sync with Outlook. Add to that easy syncing with the included software or with MediaPlayer and a dozen different download stores. You can't go wrong with the Zen.

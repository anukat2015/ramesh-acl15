Title: This is not a PTC heater, it is Quartz Infrared...
Content:
This heater does not use PTC Technology...it uses Quartz Infrared bulbs which will need to be replaced (expensive).  PTC Technology is more efficient, produces more heat, and most of all never needs to be replaced!  Do yourself a favor and buy a PTC heater.

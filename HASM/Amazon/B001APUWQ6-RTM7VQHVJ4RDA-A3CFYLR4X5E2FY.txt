Title: Sounds great, small, good battery life
Content:
My second generation shuffle broke and I was looking for a replacement and didn't like the fact that I couldn't use my own third-party headset with the third-gen shuffle.  I tried the SanDisk Sansa Clip, but I did not like the sound quality.  Then I tried the Pebble S2 and was very pleasantly surprised.  The sound quality is great, it looks great, and the battery life is very good (at least 10 hours).  If you're looking for a small and easy-to-use mp3 player, definitely buy this one.  You won't be disappointed.

Title: did anybody who designed this actually turn it on????
Content:
We replaced our old Keurig coffee maker with this one a few days ago. The old one wasn't bad, but it occasionally would mess up and grounds would go all over the place, and worst of all, when you removed the old grounds, it would always drip and make a mess all over the place.
While I see that this new version has addressed these issues, It is obvious how they did it; they hooked up a Jet engine thruster to the device. I mean this thing actually shakes the entire kitchen; it is far louder than any alarm clock I have ever owned.
This unit also adds two cup levels, regular and large, thank you for that.
So for the work office, its a bit of amusement when people four doors down from the kitchen jump when the loud motor goes off, but I can only imagine in dread if I had this thing in my apt and wanted a cup of coffee while my wife was still asleep. She'd come at this machine with a sledge hammer.

Title: Nice camera for first digital user
Content:
I have been a film camera buff all my life.  I have looked at digital cameras  for the past several years but was waiting on the features that I have in my film SLR's.  This was reasonably priced and pretty full featured (lacking only in spot metering).  I gave it a try.  I am well satisfied with it.  I have shot several thousand images and find the images more than satisfactory, the camera easy to use and am becoming a digital convert.

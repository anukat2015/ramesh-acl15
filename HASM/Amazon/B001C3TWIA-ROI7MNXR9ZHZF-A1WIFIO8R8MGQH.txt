Title: VERY disappointed - Please read before buying
Content:
When loading WMA files, the artist, album, etc - all show up as "other".  You need to rename them to MP3 for them to be read correctly.  The video looks good, but you can't fwd - rev or stop and go back to the beginning.  You need to view the entire video to get back.  (even after powering off and back on).   This is a hassle when you have a long video.   Multiple times now a video plays and then randomly comes up with a invalid video format (or something similar)  Afterwards, all videos disappear and you need to restart.   Adjusting the volume is putzy and really only have a choice of about 7 or 8 settings.  With headphones (at night) I'd like to go down one more - but it goes from too loud to off.   No program to get music setup or organized well.   It is simply like a USB jump drive where you have to copy them on manually.  NOT for the computer-illiterate.   The product seems like it has potential, but was released before it was completely developed or tested.   Given the option I would send it back and get a Zune, iPod, Sony or something else.  The touchscreen is not at all worth having for eerything else it lacks.  In fact, even the touchscreen gets annoying at times.

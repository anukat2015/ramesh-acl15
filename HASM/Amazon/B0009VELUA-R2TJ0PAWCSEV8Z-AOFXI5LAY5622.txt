Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
I have always used Cuisinart coffee pots, but never liked any of the "pour over pots", opting instead for perked coffee.  Something about the design of this pot enables the pour over style and perked flavor.  Also I love not having to worry about a carafe.
Great pot, great coffee.

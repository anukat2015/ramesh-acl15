Title: Buy on price, not quality
Content:
Good:
* cheap
* long 6-foot cord
* grill rounded outward keeps it from rolling over face-down
* dense slats to keep kids' fingers out
Bad:
* very noisy for its size (safe grill design is BAD acoustic design)
* mechanical thermostat activates over about 5 degrees
Verdict:
The thermostat would be the deal breaker for most uses. Once it kicks in, it doesn't shut off until the room heats by about 5 degrees. Then the room has to cool that much before it kicks in again. Having the room fluctuate that much is unpleasant. Similarly, the noise level makes the on/off transitions conspicuous enough that you don't want this in your bedroom if you're a light sleeper.
This would be a great choice if you want to create a warm zone in a much bigger area, however. If you need a cheap heater under the desk in a cold workplace, you couldn't do much better without doubling the price.

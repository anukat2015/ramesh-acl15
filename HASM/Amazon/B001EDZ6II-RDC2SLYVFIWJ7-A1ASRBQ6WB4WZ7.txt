Title: A gift...
Content:
...from heaven. This is possibly the nicest heater I have ever owned/seen. Quiet, safe, cool to the touch, 2 heat modes, and a fairly accurate temperature sensor. The controls on the heater are kind of a hassle and I much prefer to use the remote. Besides that I LOVE this heater. Well worth the $150 IMO.

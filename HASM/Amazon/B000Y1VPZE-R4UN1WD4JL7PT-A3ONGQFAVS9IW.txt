Title: GREAT GREAT GREAT machine!
Content:
I bought this little gem 2 years ago after reading hundreds of reviews for many different models.  I finally thought to write a review so others can benefit the way I did.  This machine has just improved with age. Makes GREAT coffee exactly the way I like it, strong!  The carafe keeps the brew hot all day long.  Easy to use.  Good looking in the kitchen.  Doesn't have a filter like many other models but I use filtered water and grind beans right before brewing.  Again, this model is very very easy to use, and makes a great pot of coffee.  No frills, but very little that can go wrong.  
Highly recommend to anyone wanting a carafe with timer.  I've had 5 coffee makers over the years and this is my favorite hands down.

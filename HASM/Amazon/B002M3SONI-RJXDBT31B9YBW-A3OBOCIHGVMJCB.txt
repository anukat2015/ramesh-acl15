I have been very happy with the Sound Quality. Using the Ear Buds I hear the subtle low tones with remarkable ambience. The IPOD sound exceeds ! what I had previously thought it would be like.
And the Volume level is not being limited to a less than favorable level.
 I like to hear my music in it's fullest effect. I do not care for my personal equipment to be set with a High Volume limiter by the factory. If this Ipod has any limiter to the Volume level. They did not set the High limit too low.
The Capacity of the Storage with the minimum 2GB. lets me store 500 songs. enough for a couple of days. Without hearing a repeated selection.

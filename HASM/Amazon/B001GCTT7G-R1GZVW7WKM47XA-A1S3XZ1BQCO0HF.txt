Title: Impressive all-round performer
Content:
I've been a PC/Windows User for 10 years and decided to switch to Mac recently. 
So I went and bought the 2.4GHz-$1599 model and I really like the new Macbook & Leopard OS. Macbook has a much better screen & hardware design
compared to Dell/HP systems on the market. Leopard is way better than Vista and slightly better than Win7RC.
Here is my take for anyone interested in buying the new macbook -
Like
-----
Aluminum body - Strong & light. Pleasure to carry & use.
Screen & Graphics - Bright LED Screen and Good Graphics Card for gaming
Multi-touch Gestures 
Leopard OS & iWork - Fast, Stable & Extremely User-Friendly. Packed with neat tools & tutorials to
help you be productive right off the box.
Dislike
--------
Slow drive transfers - Hard Drive is slow (@5400 RPM).
I would have liked to see a faster & bigger hard drive given its high price.
Touchpad click is cranky - Clicks feel like squeezing a tin can. 
Other Observations
------------------
Is it worth the money? - I think the much better Leopard OS, multi-touch trackpad & better construction justify 
its higher price to a fair extent.
Relative to 2.0Ghz ($1299) Model?  - Other than the illuminated keyboard, there isn't a big difference in performance
between 2GHZ ($1299) model that i tried out in the Apple Store and the 2.4Ghz($1599) model that I purchased online.

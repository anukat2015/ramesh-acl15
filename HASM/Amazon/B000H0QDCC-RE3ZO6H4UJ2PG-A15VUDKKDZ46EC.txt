Title: Zune, this is it...
Content:
I have had used/played with (virtually) every iPod since the beginning...sure it is a "copy" just as Apple copied (and is now being sued for) other MP3 players before it (much like their Mac UI if you know your history).  A player is a player, all I care about is what works and sounds good - have not have a single glitch and it sounds and looks great.  Admittedly their add-ons are a bit light but it took others months if not years to build up a following so I am not overly concerned.  What I am concerned about is people who do not even try it (of course good players are not cheap so not everyone can just try them all enough to really know one way or another so...)
In other words if you have one, give it a while to sink in and see if it works for you - if you don't play with a friend's and see what happens...either way competition is good so I hear and now there is some competition...
If you buy something just beause you think it is hip or anti-corporate remember that the iPod is certainly corporate and as to it being hip - hmmm....maybe you should buy something because you want it and it works and not just what others say you should...

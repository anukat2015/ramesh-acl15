Title: Timer feature is useless.
Content:
The only reason I purchased this unit was because it has a timer on it. I thought it would turn off the heat when the timer shuts off so that it wouldn't run continuously. It doesn't work that way. There is NO way to shut this off. The timer can temporarily override the thermostat control but it will NOT shut off the unit. So if you're looking for a timed heater, just buy a cheaper one and wire it through an external timer.

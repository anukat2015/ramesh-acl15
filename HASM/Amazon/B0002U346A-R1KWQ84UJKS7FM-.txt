Title: a most incredible vacuum!
Content:
we LOVE this vacuum!  our floors are tiled and it cleans them perfectly, not a cat hair escapes.  it's fast, has superb suction, and is far quieter than most other vacuums (which, given its supersuction, is somewhat surprising).  it's equally skilled at carpeting and furniture - we'll never buy another vacuum again.

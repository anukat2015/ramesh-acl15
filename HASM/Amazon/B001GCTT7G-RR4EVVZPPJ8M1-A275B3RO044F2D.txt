Title: Successful Switch
Content:
I must say that I've make a successful switch to Mac from PC, thanks in no small part to this little 13.3" 2.4Ghz aluminum beauty.  The commercials are right...just turn it on and it works.  I can't believe how fast this is with just 2 gig of Ram.  It powers up and down so fast that I'm going through caffeine withdrawels (as I used to brew a cup of coffee whenever I started or shut down my previous HP PC laptop.)  I love the crisp, bright screen, and can't believe how much of a fan I've become of the illuminated keyboard.  I run MS Office for Mac and have Fusion for a few Windows apps.  I switched to Mac because a couple buddies of mine did years ago (and survived!) and their Macs have never slowed down and are still running like new.  I swear, every PC I've purchased...gets slower and slower every couple of months (even with deleting cookies, optimizing drives, etc.)  GOODBYE VISTA!  I've switched and won't be going back.  This new Mac laptop rocks and seems built to last.

Title: Very nice money saving heater
Content:
I got one , and then ordered another because it worked so well in my bedroom .
I running both now day and night and turning down the gas heat to 60 deg. when we are sleeping or gone to work . I just got my first elect bill and it went up from $52 to $114 dollars . Plus I burnt 50 gals of propane also . Must say these work nice . The big push button on the front sets the heater to 68degs , just where I like it when watching tv etc . I run them about 3.5 on the dial at night . I do shut the bedroom doors now and it's very nice and when we come out in the living room etc , it's only 60 deg's so it's really been saving us money .
In other words , this heater is a no brainer IMO .

Title: FALLS APART FAST! Waste of good money.
Content:
Bought this over the summer. 
Problem 1- Coffee maker- the carafe does not fit properly under the dispenser. 
Problem 2- Coffee maker- the carafe is poorly designed so you have to pour your coffee over the sink because it spills all over the counter.
Problem 3- Coffee maker- makes coffee slooooooowwwwwwwly
Problem 4- Little parts started to bend or break off after 1 month.
The espresso maker is ok, but it does take quite a long time to steam the milk.
I am now shopping for a new coffee maker and espresso machine. This one has only been used since August. 
Don't do it!

Title: Love it!
Content:
My husband and I shopped around when we bought this camera and read many reviews on many websites.  We decided to go with camera because the price was very reasonable.  I must say that this is a great camera for amateurs.  We have take beautiful shots with this camera, some that people thought were taken by a pro.  It has limitations, but it has been a great starter camera for us.

Title: No need to make a pot of coffee in a stupor anymore.
Content:
I love this machine. It does have a few limitations but they are minimal and I still have to give it 5 stars.
Positives: A good consistant cup of coffee.
           Absolutly no mess!!!!
           My kids can use it for hot chocolate with no worries. No mess!!!
           broad selection of coffee.
           FAST! especially while in my stupor, no thought required.
Negatives: A lack of control for coffee strength.
           Coffee cup size to small. 
           Who drinks 7.25 ounces of coffee. I want to fill my mug!
           So you must make 2 cups. Not that big of a deal.
I saw some complaining of noise. Now really, 12 seconds of it filling the chamber after your cup is made or 7 minutes of you standing in the kitchen pulling your hair out to get that first bloody cup of coffee. And its not that noisey.
I am a coffee snob and this is the best I have gotton so far, and what a deal I got but thats another story.

Title: Did not work
Content:
I had to return this heater after a few weeks.  It would turn itself off after 20 seconds as if it had overheated.  Problem is I had to wait and wait and hope in the cold room to see if it would turn itself back on.  Sometimes it would but not for long.  For the price of $59.99 I expected a much better performance.

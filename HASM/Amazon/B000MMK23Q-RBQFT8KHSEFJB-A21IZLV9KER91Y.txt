Title: edenpure heater is different than other heaters
Content:
The EdenPure quartz infrared heater uses the water molecules in the air to transfer heat evenly from wall to wall and floor to ceiling... other heaters get really hot and the heat goes straight up to the ceiling where it is mostly wasted.

Title: Disappointed in the quality
Content:
I was looking at a Toshiba, but the guy at Best Buy convinced me to buy an Asus - Asus has been making parts for years, now they build the whole computer, etc, etc. About 2 weeks after I got it, the left mouse key got stuck in the down position. This actually worked to my advantage, because the mouse keys are so HARD to press, now if I barely touch the left button, it registers the click. A couple of weeks after that, while typing normally, the "K" key broke off. I was trying to reattach it (why they can't just snap on and off like a desktop keyboard, I don't know), but I then managed to also break off the "I" key. I guess luckily, the manufacturer does have a 1 year accidental damage warranty, but now I have to send my computer off to be fixed. Hopefully it won't take too long. They do have free 24/7 customer support in AMERICA. 
As an accountant, I thought I would really like the numbers keypad, but the keys are too small to really be funtional by someone who does 10-key by touch, and the zero has kind of a wierd placement (so I'm always hitting the right arrow key instead of the "0"). And because the keyboard is shifted to the left to make room for the number pad, I consistently hit "End" when I want to hit "Delete". Once again, why can't laptop keyboards by designed and laid out exactly like, or at least more similar to, desktop keyboards?
I'm a little disappointed that there are no "quick" keys to raise and lower the volume, or mute it. I do like the 2-finger scroll feature on the touch pad and also the placement and feel of the touchpad.
Other than the lack of quality in the keyboard, so far I have not had any problems with the computer.

Title: A Space Heater for Any Occasion
Content:
My home's primary heating source is a propane stove located in the family room. Rooms on the opposite end of the house usually are not heated sufficiently, or at least not heated fast enough. I bought the Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater to put in my home office so I wouldn't freeze while working in the winter. This heater far exceeded my expectations. It heats up the room quickly, consistently, and to exactly the temperature I specify. Whatever room it's in is routinely 10 to 15 degrees warmer than the rest of the house.
The heater is all digital and has a variety of helpful, value-adding features including a remote control, a programmable thermostat with auto shut-off, and an oscillating feature. Since buying this heater I've used it in the office, my bedroom, and even the hallway to heat an entire section of my home, always with excellent results. This is easily the best and most effective space heater that I've ever owned and I highly recommend it.

Title: Has proven to be a great vacuum...
Content:
We got this vacuum because our other vacuum wasn't cutting it anymore... with having a 1 year old and with 2 cats, 2 dogs and living on a 16 acre farm we needed a vacuum that would hold up to the task. It has proven it is up to the task... it's amazing!!! We usually vacuum every other day and I am constantly amazed at the amount of hair and dirt it pulls from the carpet. My husband just got done vacuuming and said "this is a really good vacuum".

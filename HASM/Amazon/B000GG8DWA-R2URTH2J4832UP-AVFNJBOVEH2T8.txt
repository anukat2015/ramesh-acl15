Title: This Product is easily broke
Content:
I bought this heater in Oct 19, 2009 and I had read the manual carefully and use it as the manuals but after three times I used it for 3 hours in night suddenly it did not work anymore in Dec 20, 2009. Beside that the heat is not so  good to heat a small room even I had turn it into 800 watt.
So better look for another product..

Title: Capresso Coffee Team GS
Content:
I used my previous Capresso grind and brew for ten years.  When I had to replace it, I chose the closest product, which is the Coffee Team GS 464.  I really like the new features and the coffee it makes.  My only objection is that when the coffee is ground, then followed by the water flowing through the grinds, there is always a small area, about an inch in diameter, where the water does not flow.  Thus, there are dry grounds left.  It appears as though there is a manufacturing flaw.  Other than that one objection, I fully recommend the product.

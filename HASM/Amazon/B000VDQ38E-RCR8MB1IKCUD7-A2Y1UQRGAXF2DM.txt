Title: Worse vacuum I have ever owned!
Content:
I bought this vacuum about a year ago, and probably not long after buying it I wanted a new vacuum.  It worked initially, but after a few months I realized it wasn't picking anything up.  I was emptying the canister all the time because if you don't it gets too full and the dust ends up on the floor again and the vacuum.  I looked at the canister while it was on an realized that dog hair would get stuck up in the top of where the canister locks into, so I had to reach in and pull it out a little at a time.  This was a pain because you can't get your hand into the area easily.  
I would never recommend this vacuum to anyone with animals, which is ironic because this is a vacuum call the pet hair eraser.  If you have pets buy something else!

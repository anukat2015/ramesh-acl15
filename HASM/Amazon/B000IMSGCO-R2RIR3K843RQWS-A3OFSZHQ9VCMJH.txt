Title: Much better than iPods
Content:
My daughter has this MP3 from Philips over 5 years, she has dropped it quite often, still plays and does all functions properly. I've heard of some people that had iPods Nano that they don't last too long, and they are very expensive. Her Philips is still going like it's new.

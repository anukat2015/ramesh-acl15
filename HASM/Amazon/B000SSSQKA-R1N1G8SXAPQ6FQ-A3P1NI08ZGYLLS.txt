Title: amazon service terrible - read before buying
Content:
unfortunately I cannot review the product.  I ordered/paid for a new vacuum and it was delivered on the estimated day.  What a surprise when I opened the box.  A vacuum tossed loosely in a box.  the vacuum cannister, hose, wheels were filthy, filled with dust, hair, dirt, possibly cat litter.. who knows what else..bedbugs?.  I immediately requested a return.  Amazon "customer service via phone link" said i"d have to take it to the post office - 20 lbs.  Really, give me a break.. my cell phone dime, my time, my money, someone else's dirt in my apartment... what happened to service in the good ol' usa.  amazon finally agreed to have UPS pickup at my apartment (i should have to demand?)  pick up in 2-5 business days - package on my front stoop..nyc.. hmmm and my refund is dependent upon amazon's receipt of box which i have no way of tracking.  finally after 20 minutes of demanding plus being on hold..amazon says they'll pick up next day.. the package hasn't moved yet.. refund.. dependent upon their receipt of package. C'mon amazon - credit a customers account more quickly..have a little pride.  I'm still working on it  but before you buy.. i guess anything blender, vacuum, ... 
is new really NEW
if you need to complain - who do you call?  google ..amazon complaint department first... insightful
time is money.. i've spent enough of both here..
people..it's your money..get what you pay for

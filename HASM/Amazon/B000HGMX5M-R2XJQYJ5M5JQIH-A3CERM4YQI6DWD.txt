Title: Excellent camera but needs update
Content:
I recently used a D80 all day and got really good shots (Lens was the 105 mm).  Great camera.  Very nice. The only thing is that the D80 is now two years old and doesn't have some of the latest features, such as self cleaning.  
I'm a Nikon fan but Nikon needs to come out soon - now - with the upgrade for the D80. 
Canon is eating their lunch in that market area with the new Rebel XSi and the EOS 40D. Other manufacturers are also jumping in.  
Personally, I think I will wait for the D90 (if that's what they call the upgrade to the D80) and I hope it's available soon.

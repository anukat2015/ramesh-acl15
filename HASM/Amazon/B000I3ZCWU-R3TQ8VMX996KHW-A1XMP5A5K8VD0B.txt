Title: Great quality and GREAT price!
Content:
I could not be more pleased! For some one that is a little more than a novice this camera is simply excellent!!! High-quality photographs and easy to use. I did eventually replace the lens with an 18-55mm IS lens that is a better quality lens but the kit lens is ok for initial use (I also bought other IS lenses for it). The camera is light weight and takes truly outstanding photographs when used with good quality lenses. Considering the overall cost, I could not recommend it more!

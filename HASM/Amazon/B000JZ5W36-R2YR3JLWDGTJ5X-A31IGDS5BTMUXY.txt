Title: terrible
Content:
We bought this item at Target.  We returned it after a month of use because the grinder stopped working.  We got another one.  The same thing happened.  We tried one more.  This one lasted the longest 5 months.  It died yesterday.  I cannot justify 60 dollars on this coffeemaker.  It would be more fun to watch that money swirl down the toilet.

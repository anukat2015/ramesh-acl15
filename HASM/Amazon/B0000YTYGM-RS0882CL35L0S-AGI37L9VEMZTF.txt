Title: Spillage
Content:
I've read all the reviews and suggestions about spillage problems and have tried every one, but still I get coffee "splooge" all over my counter. I never make more than 8 cups, I don't over-grind  or over-fill the coffee. I have the cap clean and screwed on right and I still get coffee all over my counter. Not nice to wake up to! I'm giving this one away. It's nice to have a carafe that keeps coffee warm, but this machine is too fussy to be worth it. I'm buying a standard coffeemaker from Braun.

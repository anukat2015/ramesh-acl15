Title: Great suction but cumbersome
Content:
I really love the suction power on the Dirt Devil 082600 but I find it fairly cumbersome.  The hose seems to get twisted around on itself which makes it difficult to maneouver the vacuum.  Also, I'm afraid to drag the canister along using the hose as it seems it may rip the hose out which means you have to keep walking back to the canister to move it foward.

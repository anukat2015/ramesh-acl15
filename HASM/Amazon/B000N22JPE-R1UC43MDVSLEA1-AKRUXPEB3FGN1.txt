Title: Nice Features
Content:
We were very happy with our Braun 12 cup coffee maker which died short of it's 5th year.  We searched everywhere for a quality 12 cup coffee maker only to learn that they are hard to find!  The reviews on the Cuisinart were very positive and the price was decent.  We are very pleased with this coffeemaker.  The coffee actually tastes a lot better than our old Braun unit.  There is no spilling when you pour a cup either.  We use the programming feature and it works like a charm.  The only slightly negative aspect is that when you program it for the morning, it turns on and makes coffee, then when the coffee is ready it beeps 5 times pretty loudly.  This beeping actually is what wakes me up in the morning.  I wish I could turn that beeper off - it wakes up the dogs too!  Other than that really loud beeping, it is a great coffee maker and I recommend it.

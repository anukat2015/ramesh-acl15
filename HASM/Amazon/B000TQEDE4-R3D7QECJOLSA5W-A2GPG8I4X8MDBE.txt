Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for about a month now and am very happy with it.  It appears to be a well built machine that should last for many years.  There are a couple of little issue's that are minor only and seem to be the focus of the complainer's who write about it.  The only time it overflowed and made a mess was when I forgot to put the carafe lid on, duh!  I also keep the lid open after use to let it dry out inside.
Pros:
    Gold tone filter
    Ability to use paper filters
    Keeps coffee hot
    The 1-4 button heats the water more before brewing for a hotter cup
    Looks good (black & stainless)
Cons:
    Water reservoir is sort of hard to fill (minor)
    So tall I can't open the lid fully under the cabinet
    
That's it.

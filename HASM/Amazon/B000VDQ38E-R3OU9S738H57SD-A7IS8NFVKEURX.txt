Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I love this vacuum - it is indeed very powerful. I can say, I wish it had an attachment that made it easier to clean corners & non-carpet floors; I did buy a vacuum broomstick (Dirt Devil All-In-One) to supplement this more powerful model. But on its own, it is still an excellent vacuum cleaner.

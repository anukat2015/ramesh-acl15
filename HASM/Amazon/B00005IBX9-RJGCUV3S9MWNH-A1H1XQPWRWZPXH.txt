Title: terrible coffee
Content:
I bought this coffee maker even though I had read a lot about how it just did not make good coffee. I bought it to match some stainless that I had and because the pot itself did not feel flimsy. BUT!!! No matter what you do (add extra coffee, buy a more expensive brand, try an espresso grind) there is NOTHING you can do to improve the flavour. Another reviewer had stated that she thought that it was the pattern of the water as it flows over the coffee and I think she must be right. So if you like your brew tasting watery all the time, and you don't appreciate a rich full-bodies cup of java, then this Cuisinart is the brand for you.

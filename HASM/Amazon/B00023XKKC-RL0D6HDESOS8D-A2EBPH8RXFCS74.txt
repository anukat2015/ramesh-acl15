Title: Great System!!!
Content:
I have been running my unit for 10 months straight.  I live in Glendale AZ, and I am accustomed to 120 degree days in the summer.  I have a three story loft, and purchased it for spot cooling my upstairs bedrooms.  It is great!  It keeps the 3rd floor about 5-8 dgrees cooler (70-72) in the heat of summer, and I have NEVER had to empty out any water.  I have never tried the other functions really, but as an A/C, this unit is top notch!  I paid $449 for it, and it was worth every penny!  It doesn't even need to stay on constantly to maintain the temp!  Good value and unit!

Title: frequenty catastrophic failures make it too unreliable to use
Content:
This machine is FABULOUS when it works, but the mess it makes when it doesn't (often) is too much to bear.
What happens is the basket and carafe don't get aligned perfectly, so the water builds in the basket till it flows down the sides AND back into the water tank.  The flow into the water tank quickly clogs up the pump mechanism.  Water flows all over the counter, making a giant mess.  There's no way to know of correct alignment until the machine starts working and you wiggle the carafe a little
Once the pump mechanism is full of grounds, The maker is then early impossible to clean and make work again.  I'm on my 2nd maker due to this, and it has happened at least 20 times across both makers.  This morning was the last straw.
What good is a device you have to watch brew?  Not only does it defeat the ability to use the timer, who has time to stare at a brewing coffee pot to make sure the darn thing works right?  Who's going to build a basin or set their maker in a sink just to ensure the mess is contained and doesn't end up all over the counter, floors, drawers, cupboard faces...
Who wants to have to deal with a giant mess in the kitchen first thing in the morning?
This device is utter crap to me, for this reason.  Unless you want to sit and watch every pot brew, don't buy one.

Title: UNRELIABLE
Content:
You will often find water all over your counter, coffee grounds dribbled under the caraffe, and a cup of tan tea in the caraffe.  Cheap plastic connections make the door unreliable, so it tends to burst open if you are not watching the coffee maker constantly, and drain water all over the kitchen.  An errant gound caught in the drain of the funnel will easily interrupt the "coffee interruptus" feature, too.  Don't try to clean the plastic funnel or to order any replacement parts -- they are uncleanable and the parts cost more than the parts to a Japanese car.

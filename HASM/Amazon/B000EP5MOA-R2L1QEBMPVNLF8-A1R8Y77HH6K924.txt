Title: Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice
Content:
I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.
I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.
There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.
Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free!

This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!
Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

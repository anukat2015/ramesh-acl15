Title: Sleek, fun, fast
Content:
I have had my MacBook Pro for three weeks now and am enthralled with it.  It is light -- easy to carry -- which is a plus since, as an academic,  I carry a lot of files and books with me at any give time.  It is lightning fast.  I've been using a G4 laptop and G4 desktop and the leap to this computer is noticeable and worth every penny.  The feel of the keyboard also strikes me as a strong selling point -- keyboarding just feels easier and, dare I say it, more fun.
Also notable about this Mac is the ease of adding memory.  I've added memory to other Macs before and this is the easiest I've ever done.  The memory cards slide in easily and I don't have to fiddle with them to get them at the right angle.  I have always loved the intuitive feeling of the Mac and I think that Apple gets this right again.  
I have noticed that the computer runs hot -- but apparently that is expected -- and I've had no problems with performance whatsoever.  The isight camera is fun too -- and creating presentations feels a whole lot easier as well.
I highly recommend this product:  it is exactly what I want in a computer and the new operating system, whose ins and out I'm still exploring, makes it even better.

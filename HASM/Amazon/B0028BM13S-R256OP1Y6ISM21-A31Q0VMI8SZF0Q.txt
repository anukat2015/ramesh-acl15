Title: Too flinsy
Content:
I got this coffee pot because it has no auto-shutoff. I makes coffee okay, but the plastic its made of is really flimsly.  Once, when I snapped the pot back in place, the edge of its top bound up against the bottom of where the coffee goes in.  I didn't notice it until after the coffee was made and had missed the pot going down its side to the counter and the floor.  What a mess!  I don't know how long this pot will hold up.  I have retired it and got a better one (without auto-shutoff, but only 10 cup) at HEB for $14.00.

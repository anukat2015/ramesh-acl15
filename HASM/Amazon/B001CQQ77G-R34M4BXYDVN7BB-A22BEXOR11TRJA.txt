Title: Highly disappointed!
Content:
When I ordered this fireplace, I liked the look of it and also felt good about the reviews.  When I set it up, I was amazed that after 2 hours of heating on the highest setting that there was no noticeable warming of the room.  After looking over the manual, I tried it again.  I held my hand near the front and still felt barely any warmth at all.  I don't feel that this fireplace could even heat a 4 by 4 bathroom.  I'm not sure if mine was defective or not, but I'm sending it back.

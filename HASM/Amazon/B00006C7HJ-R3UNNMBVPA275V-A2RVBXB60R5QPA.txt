Title: Lemon or Bad Workmanship
Content:
This worked great the first three days I had it, then it just quit blowing hot air.  When I put it on auto it did try to heat but would recycle over and over only staying on for maybe 5 seconds at a time.  The warranty sucks as Vornado requires you to send them a check for $20.00 for shipping return after you have had to pay to ship it to them.  It is very quiet but that doesn't help if it doesn't work as nothing more than a fan.

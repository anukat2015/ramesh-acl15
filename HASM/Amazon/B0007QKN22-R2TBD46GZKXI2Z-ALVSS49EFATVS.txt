Title: Awesome DSLR!
Content:
I had a tough time deciding between the Canon XT and some of the other DLSRs in the market, spcifically the Nikon models; and after 2 months of insomnia, I decided on the XT. And I am very very happy with this decision.
The clinchers were:
1) Mirrror lockup, which is not avaiable in the Nikons. This feature is particularly important for macro and superzoom.
2) Exceptionally low noise levels in comparison to other DSLRs, even at 1600 ISO and long exposures.
3) Smaller size
4) larger range of Canon compatible lenses to choose from when I might need them

Title: Terrific digital SLR for the buck
Content:
I am so excited to receive my D100!! I used to be simply a point and shoot type of person before I needed training for work and we used this model. I fell in love with photography and especially Nikon with this model! I was amazed at how much clearer, vibrant, and detailed my photographs came out versus my old 3.2 mp Olympus (about 5 years old now). What a difference!! The D100 is also very easy to use...take this from a person who never before changed ISO or meter settings and within a couple of hours I was taking pictures that I think were on par with National Geographic. 
This is a quality camera, feels sturdy but not too heavy. Lots of great features. I highly recommend Nikon just because they make a quality product with great results. You may pay a little more, but that's why I drive a Bimmer and not a Daewoo. Sometimes spending a little more makes the difference, especially if you're results oriented. =)

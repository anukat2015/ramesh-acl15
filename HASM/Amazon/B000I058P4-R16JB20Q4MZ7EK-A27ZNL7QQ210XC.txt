Title: Don't buy it: leaks, leaks, and leaks
Content:
I strongly recommend against buying this coffee maker. Coffee oozes out of the carafe (between the metal and the plastic) both during brewing (long before it actually reaches that level) and during pouring. A puddle of coffee on the counter after every cycle.

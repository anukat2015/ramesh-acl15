Title: frustrating
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker for my 82 year young Dad. It replaced his worn out one.  Every pot of coffee overflows over the basket.  The pot ends up with grounds in it.  Doesn't matter if it is for 4 cups or a full pot. We glued a piece to the back of the release on the filter basket.  It works better, but why did we have to do that?  My Dad should not have to clean up a mess each time he makes a pot of coffee or stand and hold the pot in place!  That makes the timer option worth it!  I have read where others have had to make an adjustment to this coffeemaker.  I wish I had read them before I made the purchase.  Frustrated!

Content:
After reading all the positive reviews, I purchased this product.  Could not be happier: the Sears repairman was so impressed when I started using it that he took down all the information for his daughter to purchase the vaccum.  He was fixing my washer, but had experience with vacuum cleaners and had never heard such a quiet motor.  In addition, it is compact, easy to use and feels better than any vacuum I have touched since my Rainbow. Been a long time since I have been this happy with a product.

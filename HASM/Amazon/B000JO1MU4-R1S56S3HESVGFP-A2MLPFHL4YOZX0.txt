Title: Too Cool Fool
Content:
I just picked mine up from CC bought it online and picked it up in the store. They didnt even have these out on the floor yet. This thing is great. Its syncs nicely and the screen is crisp and clear. I have a few tv epiosdes on here and about 300-400 songs and 100 or so pictures and about 7 movie previews from apple which is too cool. I still have 6.8 gigs of free space. The size is incredible its so small. The coverflow thing is cool even though it couldnt find some of the album covers from albums I ripped but thats a small price to pay as far as I am concerned. For the money its great and I dont need 80 gigs so this will work just fine for me.

Title: "Burned pixel"...
Content:
This PC it's powerful, beautiful, excellent quality, stunning graphics, top of the line.
I can't give 5 stars because my screen came with a "burned pixel". It's a tiny very bright red point on the monitor. If you have a black or dark background it's very evident. If you have a light background it's very hard to notice. I called Toshiba Services and I can change the monitor using the guaranty if I have 8 "burned pixels" all over it or if I have 3 or more in one sector. It is not a big issue, but I will buy the extended guaranty just in case. Despite this, I love the machine.

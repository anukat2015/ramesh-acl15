Title: Beautiful, strong machine!
Content:
My wife and I diligently searched canister vacuums both in town and on the internet.  We finally decided on this one and we couldn't be any happier.  Our carpet hadn't been vacuumed in several months, but this machine sucked up all the dirt and grime without a problem.  Our carpet looked several shades lighter!  And the Miele cleans very quietly and effectively.  My wife loves it's light-weight and the design.  She can carry it around without a problem.

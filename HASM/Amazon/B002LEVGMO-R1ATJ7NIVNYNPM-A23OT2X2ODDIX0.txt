Title: Good machine ...goofy keyboard
Content:
This is my 3rd Acer netbook. I have been looking for the perfect balance between screen size/ unit weight/ battery life, and performance (aren't we all). The first one was a 10" unit with a 1.6 mh Atom w/ XP. I was very suprised in the performance, screen, and keyboard. But not being too satisfied I traded for an 11" w/ 1.3 mg Atom/ w/ XP. The performance was very poor; and I don't consider myself that picky . Also the HD would crash...back to Amazon with you; dog-breath. Decided to go with the 1410 after some research. It works fine although it's currently off to Acer due to a sticky #6 key. The only real issue I have is the keyboard. Getting use to the "chicklet" style is hard . I'm not a good typer and my old fingers need all the "touch" feedback I can get, so I miss my old 10" Acer Aspire One 1.6 for that reason. Come to think of it I would have it back if I could work it due to the keyboard and an extra [...] bucks in my pocket.
One clear note from me: don't get the 11" Acer Aspire One with the 1.3 mg "non N type" processor. Even with another OS, it's still too doggie to hack the task that netbooks require; that's even with 2 gig RAM.
Another note: the Acer site is kinda lacking for netbook support (FAQ's, etc.). I can understand some of this since these units are new, but I expected more info to chose from.

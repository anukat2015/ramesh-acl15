Title: So far...  So OK...
Content:
OK, I just got this bad boy last night.  It's not bad.  The instructions are some of the most poorly written P.O.S. out there.  At one point in the instructions it calls for you to assemble two 'plates.'  Not a clue what that means as it was all put together, sans the remote.  Which you just tossed the batteries into.  So, I fired the thing up and it was pretty damn warm.  The size of the thing seems much smaller than it appears here.  The blue light, contrary to what some people are re-reporting, it does not dim after time.  I'll check again tonight, but I'm pretty sure it didn't.  The oscillation on mine seemed wacked.  It says 120 degrees, but mine just seemed to turn to the left 90 degrees.  So, it would come centered and then turn back to the left, then back to center, then left, etc...  You'd think it'd go to the right at some point...  No idea.  Also, can't tell if the thermostat on it is properly gauging the tempature.  It'd constantly bounce from 63 to 64 to 63 to 64 and so on...  Random.  Meanwhile, my places thermostat showed the tempature increasing.  I'm attributing this, for now, to the unit being on the floor where it probably is around 63/64.  Last night wasn't really a cold night around here, so I'm not sure how this baby will work on cold nights.  We'll have to see there.  
Edit - One additional note, don't believe the description on this page saying there is an ON timer.  There isn't.  At least, I don't see it.  There is a 'sleep' timer which shuts off after your set time.

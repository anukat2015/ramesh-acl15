Title: Good Performance but Heavy Heating and Not that great display
Content:
I have been using this HP laptop for a year now (actually mine is 1GB RAM and 120GB HDD)and it has certainly been great. The Performance is rock solid. Works fine, does not hangs, I can run multiple applications, DreamWeaver, Office 07 Word, Fireworks, Adobe, and Firefox browsers all at the same and the system does not slow down. So Performance I would say it has been excellent.
On the Down side, the things that drives me nuts is HEATING! AMD processors are know for heating and this laptop has been poorly designed with only one small fan outlet which is ridiculously irrelevant for the heat that is being generated by the AMD processors. 
But for the price.. this laptop is a good buy..

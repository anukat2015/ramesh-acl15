Title: 2 Years Old and I Still Love My D40x
Content:
I have had my Nikon D40x for two years now and love it just as much as I did the day I bought it.
In the ensuing two years I've learned a few things about this camera and photography which I will share.
-I did a lot of research before deciding on this camera.  Most of all I am so glad that I chose a DSLR--especially this DSLR over a Point and Shoot digital.  The additional weight/size is well worth the quality you get.
-Of all the photo settings, I would say that 80% of my photos are taken in full auto mode.  The other modes that I use regularly but less often are the aperature priority, and macro modes.  Unless you're taking photos of subjects that don't move, then I recommend the auto mode because the photo will be "gone" if you're busy fiddling with the controls.
-I take a lot of photos of my young nieces, and having no shutter lag lets me have "What you see is what you get" photos.
-This camera will improve your photography, but the bottom line is that unless you have a good eye, no camera is going to give you great shots.
-After owning my D40x for a year I invested in the Nikon sb400 flash.  The increased power/range and the ability to bounce the flash improved flash photos with the D40x by 100% over the quality of the photos with just the built-in flash.  Flash photos look so even and natural, and there's never red-eye.
-I use the 18-55 mm  lens far more than the 55-200 mm lens.
-The only thing I don't like all of the time is the function of the autofocus.  Sometimes it "misses," and I think that this is because there are only 3 focal points.
-I take all of my photos in "fine" mode.  This gives me the freedom of enlarging and or cropping later, without sacrificing quality.  I use a 2 gb SDHC card, and have never "run out" of space in a day's shooting.  I have not traveled much with this camera, but if I did and was "on the road," I would use a card with larger capacity.
-10.2 MP is more than enough--the lens optics are far more important, and Nikon makes fantastic lenses.
-Occasionally shooting at ISO 1600 isn't high enough, and I wish this camera had an ISO of 3200.  Mostly, it's not an issue except in low light situations with no flash.
I hope this retrospective review is helpful to your purchasing decision.

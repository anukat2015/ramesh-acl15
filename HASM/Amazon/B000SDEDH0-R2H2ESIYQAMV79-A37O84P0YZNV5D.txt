Title: don't even think about it
Content:
It was a monster. It was very loud, I needed to wear a pair of ear plug while I was sleeping. Draining water was a disaster. (this is the reason I return it). I only used it for 3 nights about 24 hrs, and the monitor showed full (it was not humid in our area, we havn't had rain about 1 month).OK, I got the drain pan and a drain tube that came with the product. The drain pan is about 10cmX8cm and 1.2cm deep, however, it is shallow that can only contain about 1/2 cup of water. the drain tube is about 50cm (1 1/2 in)I plugged the tube into the drain hole and have the pan to catch water from the tube. The first load water filled out the pan so quickly, so water spilled on the floor. The second load I reacted quicker before drain pan filled of water. I use right hand to hold the tube upright (so water would not come out), the other hand to dump water into a bucket. While I was dumping water, the tube disconnected form the drain hole, of course, water was everywhere. I was so made about its design. the drain pan is so small but water came from the machine was a lot (about more than half gallon). Anyway, whoever wants to buy this product, I will not recommend this product.

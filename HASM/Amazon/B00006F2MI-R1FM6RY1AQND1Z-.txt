Title: Convenience in the AM, pain in the @*&amp; the night before!
Content:
This machine makes a great cup of coffee - if you are willing to work hard to maintain the grinder, which crusts over with coffee dust after every use.It gets to the point now where we won't make coffee, because of the clean-up afterwards.And one more thing - the grinder sounds like a jet taking off.  We cover the machine with a towel every night, so that it won't wake the kids.

Title: Convenience defined
Content:
Pros:
GREAT cup of coffee
brews quickly
it'll brew for different size cups
fairly easy although there is a bit of a learning curve
I like the stylish shape of the unit it fits nicely on the counter
Available pods in my favorite, Starbucks Verona and Breakfast Blend
Cons:
Expensive water filter
Expensive unit
Expensive coffee pods/relatively cheap for quality of coffee though.
coffee quickly turns cold--but I like the other reviewer's idea of pre-heating the cup in a bowl of hot water, I think this could do the trick.
difficult to treat a group of people to coffee (say after a dinner party) but I understand this product is aimed at the before work "one cup a joe person"
Although you can brew coffee in a larger cup you are left with only one pod of grounds so you strength is quickly diluted in a 16 oz to go mug.
no sweeteners are added to the lattes which would be nice

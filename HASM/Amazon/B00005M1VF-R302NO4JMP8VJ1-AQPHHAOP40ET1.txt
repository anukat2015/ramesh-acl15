Title: Cuisinart Two to Go
Content:
It brews much faster than my old coffee maker but the coffee does not taste any better than my old one made. The filter holder has a swing up handle which is convenient but rather fragile. The "insulated" cups get very hot when filled with coffee so I don't know how long the coffee will stay hot if you take it with you. I drink the coffee at home so it is used rather quickly so I don't care.

Title: Great value for the price
Content:
When our electrolux broke, we weren't prepared to shell out several hundred dollars for another, so we 'settled' on this.  
It turns out we didn't 'settle' at all.  We are very impressed with the quality and performance of this vac (especially for the price).  It actually outsucks our electrolux.
The quality of the hose is nice, and the power cord rewind works well.  The attachments are kindof small, though.
Another bonus, this vacuum uses Hoover type S bags, which we can find anywhere very inexpensively.

Title: Simply love it
Content:
I have no complaints about this product at all.  I have plenty of memory to keep two movies, about 600 pictures, a few hundred songs, several pages of apps, and still have a little room to spare. The movies eat up the most memory by far.  I do recommend the update from iTunes-- the ability to copy and paste alone is worth the price.

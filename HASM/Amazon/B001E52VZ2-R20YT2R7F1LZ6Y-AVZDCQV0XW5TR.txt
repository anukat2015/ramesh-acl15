Title: good power
Content:
I bought this vacuum to do my stairs and bare floors. I needed something small and light. I was very surprised at the power. It lifts my small rugs up off the floor. The only thing that I didn't like was the vacuum head has no adjustments. Lucky for me all the attachments from my old Eureka canister fit this one also.So now I have a easier to handle more powerful vacuum with all of the great attachments from my old model. I'm very pleased.

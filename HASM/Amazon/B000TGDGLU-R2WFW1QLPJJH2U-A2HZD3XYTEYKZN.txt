Title: good product, with one caveat
Content:
This is a great little heater for a small space.  But beware - the smell is terrible.  After nearly a month of using it every day, the smell is still not gone (I'm guessing that the smell is from the paint on the surface of the heater).  The heater is in my small basement, turned on the lowest possible setting, just warm enough to keep the chill off and eliminate dampness.  It has added about $1.00 per day to my electric bill.

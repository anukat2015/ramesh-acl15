Title: Poor Warranty Policy
Content:
Unit stopping working properly after 9 months, it would shut off on high and not turn back on after the temperature drops.  After contacting their customer service, they will replace the unit, but I have to pay for shipping and pay to return a section of the plug.  Why should I pay more money for a product that is defective?  There are better companies out there with better warranties than this.

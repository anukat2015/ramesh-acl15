Title: "Giant" coffee maker
Content:
This small single cup coffee maker is a "giant" machine. It is simple to operate, takes up a little space, and completes the job in record time. We have been surprised how much we use it as "non-coffee" drinkers. It is handy for tea and other hot drinks. I purchased another machine for my mother who lives alone. I highly recommend this single cup coffee maker for anyone!

Title: Very happy with clean thermostatically controlled heat in the garage
Content:
I spent a lot of time debating the type of heater for a three car garage - well insulated, with 9' ceiling.  In Oklahoma it does some times get pretty cold. However, when it is in the 20s outside my garage is warm and comfortable.  The thermostat is great.  I have the heater waving a wall so it never is blowing on me.  I found it easy to install if your comfortable putting in 2 - 30 amp breakers and fishing some wire.
Actually, I did really well buying this and thanks to all the people who wrote reviews that helped me decide.

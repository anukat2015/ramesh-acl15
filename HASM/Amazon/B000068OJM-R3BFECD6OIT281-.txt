Title: Only for the true music lover...
Content:
From the very popular and well known manufacturer's of the Sound Blaster PC sound card; Creative made this awsome mp3 player. This 20gig unit while a little bulky has excellent sterio definition and easy to use operation.  Not only can you have all your favorite tunes, but also all the quirky ones you sometimes listen to. From Rocky Horror to Bing Crosby, from Metallica to Frank Sinatra you have plenty of room for every thing.  Set up play lists based on genre, artist or even a type of mood (ie: pick-me-up or a mellow out melody.)  This unit is great!  It's sturdy and durible. A fabulous investment!

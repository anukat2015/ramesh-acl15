Title: Vacuum
Content:
The vacuum was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who has two terriers.  Now that she has a new baby, she is becoming more aware of the pet hair in her house.  She said that the vacuum works really well, but she is having trouble getting enough suction through the hand-held attachments for them to be effective.

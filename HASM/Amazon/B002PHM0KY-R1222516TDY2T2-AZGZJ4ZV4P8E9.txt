Title: Best of many laptops I've owned
Content:
I've always been reasonably happy with laptops from Dell, Acer, and HP, but this Sony is the first portable computer I've owned that deserves a five star rating. It's a very sharp looking machine, the graphics are crisp and clear, the processor and RAM are more than adequate, and the 64 bit version of Windows 7 is a breath of fresh air after that dismal failure of an operating system known as Vista. I especially like the ability to go online without actually booting up the machine. When I just want to scan the news or check email, the VAIO will power up and be online in twelve seconds or less. I can recommend this machine without reservation.

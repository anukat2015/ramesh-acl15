Title: Does what it's supposed to and looks nice on the counter-top!
Content:
Can't beat the price; we purchased this unit as a replacement to an old and faithful Krups that was still doing its job.  In addition to its simply looking nicer (and newer), the thermal features of the Cuisinart pot do keep the freshly made coffee hot a lot longer than the old Krups unit.  We did, in spite of all the warnings, experience a mismatch in getting the basket closed tightly enough and we had good, rich coffee all over the counter, in the cabinets, and on the floor!  
I'm not at all pleased with Cuisinart's "Customer Service Center," however.  Our first unit simply didn't work.  It took several calls to get permission to send the piece back for servicing and the cost for shipping it with UPS was nearly $19 (over half the price of the unit itself!).  We have received a new, refurbished unit and it seems to be working nicely, but it was a real hassle.

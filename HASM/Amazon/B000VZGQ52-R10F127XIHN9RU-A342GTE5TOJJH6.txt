Title: great for heating a bedroom
Content:
I originally purchased this heater to use in the garage when I work on my cars during cold weather.  For kicks, since my master bedroom tends to get colder than other rooms during the winter, I tried it in there and it works great.  It's reasonably quiet, much more so than a few other space heaters I've tried that were advertised as "quiet".  The two knobs are simple to use.  With the heat knob at about 40% of full setting and the fan knob at the second lowest setting, it does a great job of keeping a large bedroom, a large bathroom, and a large closet nice and toasty all night.  This heater blows a ton of hot air at full setting, much more than is need in most rooms.  At 40-50% setting, it blows warm, comfortable air, does *not* get hot enough to burn, and I can comfortably rest my hand over the front grill.  It is child and pet friendly.  The unit is well put together and sturdy.  It's virtually impossible to tip it over.  It pivots to adjust the airflow angle.  This is one of the better purchases I have made in a long time.  I would buy it again without hesitation.  I rate it four stars simply because it's not silent.

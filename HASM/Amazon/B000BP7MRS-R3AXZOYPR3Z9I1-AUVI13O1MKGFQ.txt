Title: best coffee maker
Content:
you don't even need to look at another coffee maker. this is the best i have seen. my inlaws use bunn coffee makers, and i am surprised how much more coffee you have to use in them. the coffee maker at work has a carafe that you have to pour extremely slow or it will drip.
the other coffee makers i have had, (mr. coffee... ect.) didn't last long, and the paper filters folded over while brewing. this one has a metal filter that works as good as day one, and i have had it for over three years with no problems.
two heaping scoops of coffee makes a full pot of strong, hot coffee. and i wash everything in the dishwasher (carafe, lid, basket, metal filter).
some people don't like the water filter, but as long as you have good water, you don't need to use it. i never even used the filter that came with the maker.
the only knock i have, (and it is my fault, not brauns) is if you get coffee grounds in between the coffee maker and the basket, it will clog, and coffee will go everywhwere.
if you want a nice looking, dependable, affordable, economical, easy to use coffee maker, look no farther.
if you buy a bunn for the status symbol, don't say i didn't warn you.

Title: Have had this for 2 years
Content:
I bought this for my infant son's 12'x 12' room in November 2007. It's still running and we've had no problems with it. I have it mounted on the wall so that it's out of reach of my son as the front can get hot to the touch. However, if you did touch it, you wouldn't burn yourself before you pulled your hand away.  
It heats quite well and quickly. The only thing I wish it had was a digital thermometer to set the temperature instead of the dial. To get by that, we have an electronic room thermometer as a workaround (about $10 from Big Lots) to tell when the room reaches the proper temperature after-which we turn the temperature dial down until the unit turns off. That way, when the temperature goes back down the unit will turn on automatically and turn off at the exact temperature we want. When the unit turns itself on, sometimes it makes a few popping sounds due to heat expansion, but it hasn't disturbed my son's sleep.

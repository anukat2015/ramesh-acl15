Title: VALUE VALUE VALUE
Content:
I love this vacuum. The floor power head is fantastic. The adjustibility of the wand and having the controls in the handle are both fantastic. It's light and powerful. the powerhand tool is not electric. It works on the vacuum to make it work. Very powerful but fairly small. The floor tool is also small, but they sell a 12" one for $20 that I bought. The cup is also small and needs to be emptied often. With all that said, I still love the vacuum due to its ease of use, light weight, and price point. I would have rated it a four if the price was twice as high. But it's not!

Title: Terrible Camera
Content:
I purchased this camera not even two months ago and recently sold it. This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.
Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the 1300 dollars I did to get this piece of junk. Unless your not a bigtime photographer, you can take just as good shots with a cheap point and shoot camera.

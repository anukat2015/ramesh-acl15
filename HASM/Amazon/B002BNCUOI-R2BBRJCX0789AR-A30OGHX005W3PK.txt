Title: Roxio Creator Insert
Content:
I just bought my Notebook this past October 2009. I like the note book and think it is great for what I need it for. 
HOWEVER!!!! In my package along with many other inserts came an insert for LightScribe (Disc Labeling) On this Insert indorsed by HP it says unbder bullet point 
"*Burn a custom, silkscreen-quality monochrome label directly onto the face of the disc using the Roxio Creator software alreadyinstalled on all LightScribed-enabled HP PC's."
I have spent HOURS with HP's outsourced customer service representatives and also with Case Managers. This inser is very clear that the Roxio creator software was installed onto all LightScribed-enabled HP PC's. I have gone back to Staples and checked ALL of thier instore PC's and they do not have the Roxio Program as well.
talking and with the HP Representatives they have basically said they do not use this software anymore and have not for several years. Well, NOT ACCORDING TO THIS INSERT! When talking to HP they basically said have you read the specs. I let her know that I did but this was basically false advertising and she stated "If that is what you want to call it."
WOW, this could have been solved very easily a LONG time ago but since the OVERWHELMINGLY HORRIBLE SERVICE I am going to see this one out.
Thanks I hope this helps you and contact me with information if you have the same issues.

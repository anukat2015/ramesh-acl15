Title: This product is a BOON - (Not anymore)
Content:
This item is fantastic.  The controls are easy as pie, the unit fits in your coat pocket or briefcase, it holds gobs of files, what else do you want.  I feel bad for all those suckers who shelled out all that extra cash for an I-Pod.  The only complaints are that I hate Music Match and I really prefer Real Player.  I tried to transfer my mp3 that were created with Real and the tags did not transfer.  But that criticism is of MusicMatch, not the Lyra.  File transfers are slow, I loaded the Lyra to a quarter of capacity and it took 90 minutes to transfer the files from the PC.  Again, not a major problem.  Still, it was a great purchase and I highly recommend it.  I use XP and had no problem. Well, that's a lie, the first time I hooked it to my PC the Lyra froze.  I think it was my fault as I did not follow the instruction card.  Anyway, when it froze it was a snap to reset, so no problem.  I guess you need to be a little (very little) computer literate to use the machine, but if you use mp3 files for music, you need to have some computer knowledge.  So, in conclusion, if you want an mp3 juke box, this is a good choice.
So, the glowing review above is true, except that the headphone jack no longer works.  A marvel of modern technology, 5,000 songs in the palm of your hand, and the 50 year old headphone jack technology doesn't work.
Shame on RCA - I wish I were one of those "suckers" who bought an iPod.

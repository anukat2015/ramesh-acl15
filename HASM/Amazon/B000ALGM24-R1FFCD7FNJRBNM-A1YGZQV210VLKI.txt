Title: Great Thermostat !!!
Content:
I have had several programmable thermostats, like White, Honeywell, etc...and this one by Hunter is really good.  I bought a Honeywell 2-day/5-day unit last year, and it was difficult to program, and after I programmed it, it had a mind of its own. I am a electronics tech, and am very technical.  This Hunter unit is very easy to program and works great.  I havn't had to touch it since I programmed it, last month.  Just a graet unit, and the price is very good thru Amazon. $79 in Lowe's I think.

Title: Lousy Machine
Content:
I purchased this machine based on the Black and Decker name,and the price.The [amt] price seemed more than reasonable until you use the machine,then you realize it is way overpriced at any figure.The swing out removeable brew basket is awkward to say the least.This is not a major problem but it could stand a lot of improvement.Be sure you don't fill the carafe a drop over the maximum 12 cup line or you are going to have water runing out the back of the coffee maker from what I assume is an overflow hole in the back.The 2 hour safety timer is another joke in itself.It shuts down the hot plate at various times from 30 minutes to two hours or sometime in between.It has a mind of its own.NOW,the biggest joke of all.Black and Decker must have sublet the manufacture of the carafe to a dribble glass company.You cannot pour anything from this carafe without pouring more out on the counter than you get into the pot or cup.It is one big mess from the time you start to brew the coffee until you try to drink a cup of it.We finally give up and went out and bought a Braun and have been more than happy with it.I wouldn't even waste the price of postage to send the VersaBrew back.I rated this product one star because I have to use at least one,I can't give it a zero

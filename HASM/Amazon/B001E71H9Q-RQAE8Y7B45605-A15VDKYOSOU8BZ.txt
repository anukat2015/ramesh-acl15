Title: Nothing Else Like It
Content:
The Lenovo X200 is unique among ultraportable notebooks in that it gives you a full-power Core 2 Duo processor in a 3lb package - most everything else this size comes with a much-less-powerful ULV chip. Despite the lack of an ULV processor the computer runs cool and easily manages 3-4 hours with the six-cell battery. Owing to the full-power processor, the performance is outstanding - nothing in its size class can touch it.
The stark black design is a matter of taste. Some will complain that it's virtually indistinguishable from a ten-year old Thinkpad, but I dig the classic look. The machine is functionally flawless - no design element makes you ask "What were they thinking?" The keyboard is great to type on, the pointing stick sets the standard and plenty of ports are included.
After four months of very heavy use the computer still looks like new. A few minor complaints - the mouse buttons are a bit looser than they used to be, the battery has always had a bit of wiggle, and the hinges have less resistance than those of the x61. My machine was one of the earlier models - maybe the newer ones are better, but other than these quirks the quality is outstanding. The screen could be a bit brighter, viewing angles could be better, and the graphics performance leaves something to be desired - my old 12" PB G4 upstages the Lenovo in this regard. Still, despite these issues there's no notebook that I'd rather have.

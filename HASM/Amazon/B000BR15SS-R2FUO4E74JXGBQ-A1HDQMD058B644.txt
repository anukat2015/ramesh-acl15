Title: It does the job
Content:
Mr. Coffee's main feature is the brew temperature is right, its not excessively hot, so coffee is not bitter.  While Mr. Coffee's are made cheaply, its reasonable to get 5 years or more from each.  Since the unit moves hot water around, its only a matter of time past its design life before a hose fails, a heating element burns out, the plastic body crack from age or the power switch reach its designed lifetime.  
I've seen other drip makers with friends or hotels, and the same beans I use on my Mr. Coffee taste's sharp in their machines, is too hot to drink at times, suggesting its overheated and thus, over extracted.
I had this coffee maker for over 7 years and unlike others, it never leaked.  
In its 5th year, the power ON light died.  2 years later, the switch would make light sparks, until one day, the switch fell apart, exposing the metal connectors.  A switch like this costs about 50c, but it can only be found in specialized electronics stores with $5-10 S/H costs.  Consumer grade switches are typically rated for 10,000-50,000 activations, and for the 7 years I used it 2-3 daily, or 4-6 actuations [one for on, one for off], that's 15,000, within its ball park.
The heating pad did flake off much of its black colored paint, to expose a bare aluminum color, but it didn't stop it from working.  They should just leave it uncolored!  It looks better.
This design has a swing door that is functional, but less convenient. Newer Mr. Coffee designs Mr. Coffee TF5 4-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, Black have removable grind baskets which have a spring trap so you can pour a cup before the final drips are done; its also easier to clean and load. 
Commercial grade coffee makers last over 20 years, and I'd rate those 5 stars.  So 4 stars for Mr. Coffee isn't too bad.

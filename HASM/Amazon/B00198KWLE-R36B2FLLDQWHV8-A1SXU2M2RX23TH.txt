Title: Scary Computer, Scary Support
Content:
I have an 8month old inspirion 1525 and it has a host of issues.  The screen has a black spot and the resolution went out and is wobbly and unusable, the ac adapter overheats and sparks, the laptop itself overheats, the battery won't work even though it has a full charge and is unchargeable.  Dell support is saying that there is a crack in the screen and it's my fault and is now being transferred to their 'holding' department which is basically the place computers go when the warranty is not being honored.  No mention of the ac adapter and when I asked they just said that the computer will be in the hold department tomorrow and gave me a number to call and check in .  I expect I will have to spend more time and energy defending myself from their defective product.  Lastly, I've been researching the complaints and all that I've stated have been complained about many times over.  I wish I read the reviews BEFORE purchasing.  I have a Dell home computer which has never given me any issues and I've had it for 7 years.  I guess I expected the same quality from the laptop.  Live and Learn-----yeah right a scam is a scam! I'm going to research to see if there is any class action law suits.  I'm not the suing kind but it seems to be the only way for me and many, many others to be heard!!

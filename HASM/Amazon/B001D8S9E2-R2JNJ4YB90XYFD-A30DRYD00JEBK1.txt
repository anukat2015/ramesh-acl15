Title: Aluminum Macbook 2.0ghz
Content:
Bought this as a Christmas gift to myself and i must say that i will never go back to a windows PC.  I must say that OS X leopard is amazing and all of the programs and possibilities of the Macbook are amazing.  I have created a website already with this product for my Church and i have written papers, i have done so much and am just excited to see everything i can do with this stock product.  Buy this if you can afford it as the extra money you are paying for OS X leopard is worth it.

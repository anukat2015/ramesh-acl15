Title: Flamed out after five months
Content:
My review title says it all, really. I bought this heater because it was a Consumer Reports top pick. And I loved it -- effective, quiet, easy to use -- until it flamed out five months after I bought it. Quite literally. This was after using it for probably six hours a day (except weekends) during those five months. One day I noticed my cat staring at it; curious, I looked, too, and suddenly a bright orange spot the size of a nickel appeared near where the power cord entered the unit, and there was a burning smell. I quickly turned it off and unplugged it. There was a scorch mark where the flareup had been. After letting it cool, I plugged it back in and tried to turn it on, but it was (and is) permanently dead.
Needless to say I am disappointed with the short lifespan of this product, and am feeling rather lucky that I happened to be close by, and able to unplug it quickly, when it decided to have its fatal meltdown. Who know what damage it might have caused if I'd been out of the room.

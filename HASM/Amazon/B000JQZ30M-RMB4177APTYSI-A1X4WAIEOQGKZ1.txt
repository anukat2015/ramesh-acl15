Title: Hot! ... Looks great and works great
Content:
In Houston there is not much occassion for a heater but when the occassion rises it should work well. For the last two "winters" (haha) I have avoided being downstairs at all. The home's central heat rises up and keeps the upstairs toasty but the downstairs feels like a meat locker even with the central heat on 90F! I had never considered having a space heater at home but had used one successfully at work in freezing cold office spaces so I finally had a light go off to get one for the downstairs heating dilema. Last night there was finally an opportunity to test out this heater and I am thrilled at how it subtly warms the space and looks good enough to house in a stylish living room! This looks great and heats very well with zero issues. Enjoy! BTW: I shop Amazon constantly but I will confess that I did purchase this at Wal-mart for $40.00. Big savings unless you want the convenience of it arriving on your door-step.

Title: GREAT CARAFE BUT COFFEE MAKER NOT RECOMMENDED
Content:
I purchased this item in search of a thermal coffee maker that not only keeps the coffee hot, but actually brews coffee at the correct temperature to produce flavorful coffee that is not bitter. The Zo is unable to do so, because the brew temp is barely 180 degrees. A coffee maker must brew above 194 to really hit the sweet spot and produce great coffee. Also as soon as it arrived I ran water through it to test brew temp. Unfortunately it stopped brewing and shut off at the 2 cup mark leaving water left in the water tank. Not a good sign. The body of the unit is really cheap and flimsy and smells of very strong plastic. I am going to try my luck with another brand. On the plus side the water stayed hot in the carafe for hours. So basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe. It is a shame they could not produce a machine as perfect as their carafe. So if you could care less about what the coffee tastes like and just want it hot this is the maker for you.

Title: Great one cup coffee maker
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker for a military medical humanitarian aid trip I was taking.  I like a good cup of coffee and knew I wouldn't get it where I was going unless I brought it myself.  Years ago I bought a neat little travel pot (Krups?), but the seals are bad and it no longer works, so I did my research and chose the B&D.  I took it on my trip and it worked extremely well (I was the envy of my barracks mates).  Now I'm home and it sits on the counter where my other, multi-cup maker formerly sat.
Pros:  Fast and simple.  It makes a nice big cup of coffee (~16 oz).  Works with or without a paper filter.  Really easy to clean.  No heater plate to burn the coffee or get rusty/crusty - this also means I can place the included travel mug or about any coffee cup under the spout.
Cons:  Not as compact as my old Krups in which the pot and cup, etc nested together into a zippered bag.  I don't think the B&D is designed as a travel unit as much as a small simple counter top unit.  Still it tucked into a corner of my suitcase well enough - and I didn't have to worry about a glass carafe.
Summary:  Some people seem to think making coffee should be rocket science (or voodoo black magic).  I think it is about moving clean, hot water through good, freshly roasted and ground coffee.  This Black & Decker unit does that very quickly and efficiently.  I drink one cup of coffee at a time and that's how I make it.  It can't be much simpler than this.

Title: Cuisinart Grind and Brew
Content:
I had one of these before that I bought brand new.  I received two replacements and eventually the grinder stopped working.  I purchased this one because I love the coffee pot and didn't want to buy another at full price.  It arrived in decent condition, there were some scratches on the stainless steel.  Also, the grinder gets stuck in the unit so I had to purchase another grinder for $15 from Cuisinart.  Overall, I love the coffee pot when it works.

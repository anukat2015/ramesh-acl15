Title: Not good for excercizing!
Content:
Apple forgot the coolest feature from all previous Ipods.... I have a 30 gig Ipod which I love to use when I ride my bike or go skiing.... The video version doesn't allow you to connect an extension excessory that enabled you to switch songs and volume.... with the video version you would have to remove the ipod to do this....
poor design....

Title: THIS SUCKS
Content:
This is the worst service i have received from this company ever. The screen to the ipod doesn't work. There is a sticker on the back the is impossible to get off. And the buttons and everything is stikey, broken, or just a peace of crap. When looked at this produced on your website it said Apple ipod nano 8gb black IN GOOD CONDITION. Notice the capped words. If this is what you call good condition, go get your eyes checked out. no joke. Also the man we bought this from e-mailed me back and said he knew that it was not in good order and could not be returned. Well lets be clear about this i want my money back. Have a nice day.

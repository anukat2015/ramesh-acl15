Title: Glad I upgraded to Apple
Content:
Wow!!!!! Was simply amazed on how this item looks and feels in person. After being on the PC for so long it does take a couple of days get used to Apple Operating System. I just enjoy the fact that this works immediately right out the box. It is also a plus that Apple give its users the ability to partition the Macbook so that Windows can be installed using a program called BootCamp. Before purchasing, check out the tutorials on apples website just to make sure this is the right machine for you. Just simply a great machine; no regrets.

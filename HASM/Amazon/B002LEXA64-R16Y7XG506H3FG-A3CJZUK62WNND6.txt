Title: Plesantly Pleased
Content:
I have been impressed so far. I bought two other netbooks one from De** and another form MS**. They both use the ATOM processor and have 10" screens. I could not view HD on YouTube or watch TV on hulu. It was horrible. Now I can watch HD both (hulu & Youtube). 
Ok I have to admit that as soon as I received the laptop I installed Windows 7. Vista was slowing down the system. I noticed improvements immediately in how HD videos played. Win7 is the way to go. Just for kicks I added 2GB of memory for a total of 4GB. Win7 recognized all of the memory which is great because the video can utilize more memory should it needs it. I noticed even better HD playback with the extra memory. I did nothing special other than install the memory and windows 7. 
I am impressed with the quality, features, battery life, keyboard size, and HDMI output. I am having issues with the HDMI output under win7, but cannot complain since Acer has not released the drivers for win7. 
For the rest of the people that are being super critical of this netbook/notebook consider the price tag of $460. I you expect this little portable inexpensive device to perform like a $1600 product, then what can I say? Delusional comes to mind. This netbook will cover any of your day-to-day computing needs, HD playback, it can also handle CATIA V5, matlab, AUTOCAD and Office with no problems. If you want it to play Crysis at full settings, then you are unreasonable to ask for this machine to perform especially for what it costs. Overall there is no product in this segment and price that can do its job better. I hope this helps.

Title: fair at best
Content:
After spending a lot of time shopping for a thermal, programmable coffee maker with a reasonable price, I decided on this one from Mr Coffee, a brand I have had before.
The coffee is warm at best when it is first made, so is never hot.  I use paper filters, and they often fall over in the basket, allowing for grounds to fall into the coffee.  I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago, but am already looking for a replacement.  I do like the ease of the programmable feature.
Would not recommend this product.

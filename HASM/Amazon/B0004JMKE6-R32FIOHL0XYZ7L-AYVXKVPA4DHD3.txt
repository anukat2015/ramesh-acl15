Title: Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker Difficult to Program
Content:
We had a Krups 12 cup ProAroma, which we really liked. After it died, we decided to try the Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe.  The Krups FME2 was very difficult to program. The timer was not too bad, but it was definitely more difficult than the Krups ProAroma timer had been. It was hard to determine whether the timer was set to "On" or "Off". It was almost impossible to set the length of time that we wanted the coffee pot to remain on. It made a good cup of coffee. And the glass carafe was easy to pour and did not drip. But we were still unable to use the coffeemaker for the purposes for which we intended it. We returned the Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker

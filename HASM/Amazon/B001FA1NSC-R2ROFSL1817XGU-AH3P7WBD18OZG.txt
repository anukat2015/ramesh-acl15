Title: Perfection!
Content:
Bought the bright green 2GB 2nd generation iPod shuffle for myself, and the special edition red 2GB 2nd generation iPod shuffle (available only through Apple; proceeds go to AIDS in Africa) for my wife.
We're about to go on a vacation in Aruba, and I thought this would be a nice addition for the plane ride, sunning on the beach, and working out.  It's so tiny and lightweight that you can clip it on and forget about it.  The controls are tiny, but even for my big hands they're easy to use.  No, you don't get all the functionality of bigger iPods, but if you just want to grab about 400+ songs and go!, it's a great little gizmo.
Loading songs and powering up is a cinch, even for us technically challenged types.  I made a folder in iTunes with favorite songs, then hooked up the iPod and left it go for the afternoon.  Voila!  The iPod did all the work.  
Sound quality is just great for something the size of a matchbook carting all those tunes around...  I also ordered the plug adapter charger, since the battery life is about 10-12 hours, and on vacation that won't go far.  For everyday recharging, you can get it powered up via USB to your computer.  
I also got my wife's iPod engraved, since it was technically a birthday present.  She had always said she didn't see any need for an iPod, but once she tried it out with all her favorite songs on it, she was ecstatic.  
Maybe someday I'll also get one that handles vid and pics, but for now, this is simplicity defined!

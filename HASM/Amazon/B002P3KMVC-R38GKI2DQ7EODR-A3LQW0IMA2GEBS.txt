Title: Awesome, period.
Content:
Best in class, price/performance. ASUS is excellent quality, highly recommended. Much better than netbook, better performance/battery in similar form factor.
pro:
+battery life: 12 hour max is true for light use (word processing), 8 hours heavy use is extremely reasonable, much better than 4 hours max for other laptops 
+performance: low voltage core2 duo is powerful- even though it says 1.3ghz, still far outperforms any atom/turion/pentium/celeron budget trash processors + 4gb DDR3 RAM, 500gb HD, excellent
+price: a few years ago this class of ultrathin laptop would start at $3k+ (this is why technology is sweet - constant improvement)
+design: brushed aluminum top is pretty, laptop is really thin, light and portable, lasts the entire day
+windows 7: is quite good
+keyboard: good.
+screen: very clear and bright, better than my old dell lcd
+speakers! I really like the altec lansing built-in speakers, they go pretty loud and are clearer than most laptop speakers. they are in the front of the laptop pointing down, so you can still hear them when you close the lid
note these points:
-integrated graphics: no heavy gaming on this
-no bluetooth: actually I never use bluetooth so this is a positive, saves battery
-no DVD drive: just be aware that you need an external drive if you need this capacity. but with everything on the internet now, DVD is kind of like floppy disk now, might as well save weight + battery
-glossy: wipe it off every few days, good habit in general ;)  (on matte surfaces, even if it doesnt look dirty it is still dirty, might as well know when it is dirty with glossy surface...)
btw I bought this computer for my gf, she loves it.

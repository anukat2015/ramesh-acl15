Title: Great coffe pot but...
Content:
This coffee pot is great. I had a four cup coffee pot that just never made quite enough coffee for two. When it finally broke I was thrilled to find a five cup! I love the fact that is is programmable. I also love the fact that it has a two hour automatic shut off. It makes just enough coffee for my fiance and I. So far I have not used the permanent filter, but it looks like it will work. I have some leftover paper filters that I want to use up first. The negative aspects are that it is hard to see the water level indicator. I am under the age of 30 and really struggle to see how much water is the water resivour. Like another reviewer mentioned a floating red ball would have been a true asset. The other negative is that no matter how hard I try, I always spill water when pouring water from the pot. This is not a sometimes problem. It is a daily problem. Overall this is a great coffee pot if you have excellant vision and a dish rag handy to clean up the water spills.

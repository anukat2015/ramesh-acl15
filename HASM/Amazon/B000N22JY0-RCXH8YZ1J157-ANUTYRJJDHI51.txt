Title: I especially like the remote control and timer features
Content:
This is my second winter using the Lasko 5521 Ceramic Tower Heater.  I'd say it functions more as a personal heater than a whole room heater, but that suits my needs.  The tower is portable enough to be moved between rooms as needed, and this allows me to keep our central heating thermostat set fairly low.  
I especially like the remote control and timer features.  I use the remote to turn the heater on a few minutes before getting up and the timer to automatically shut it off shortly after going to sleep.  I'm not sure this unit is strong enough to heat large spaces with high ceilings, but it does a very nice job providing focused heat in an energy efficient manner.

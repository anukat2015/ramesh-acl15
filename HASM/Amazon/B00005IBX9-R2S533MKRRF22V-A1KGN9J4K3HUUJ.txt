Title: Best coffee maker out there
Content:
I recently bought this despite reader reviews of the coffee not being hot enough. I guess those people have broken models, because mine is very hot. I add an ice cube to my coffee now. My Mr. Coffee was never hot, despite the ability to adjust the warming plate.*The caraffe does not spill, no matter how fast you pour it.*It looks good and is built solid (my mr. coffee rusted though).*It is simple and easy to use.*It has a 3 year warranty, versus one for most others.This coffee pot is worth the extra $50 over cheaper pots.~happy brewing.....

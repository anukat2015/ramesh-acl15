Title: The Hp mini is perfect for a high school student.
Content:
I am a junior in high school, and I take it to school everyday. It fits with my books with ease. it is extremely durable. The space is not the best, but if you get beyond that, its an awesome laptop. it gets about three hours a battery life, and has great speakers compared to other netbooks. the screen attracts dust though, so make sure to keep it in a sleeve if carrying it around.XP is nice, but is little boring, so right now I am running Linux. Internet is pretty fast, and I would give it a 7 when it comes to wireless. all in all, it's a great laptop, looks, sounds great and will definately get the job done.

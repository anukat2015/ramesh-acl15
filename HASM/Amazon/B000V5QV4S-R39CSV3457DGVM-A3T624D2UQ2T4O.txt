Title: Works great even for a professional
Content:
I work full time as a freelance photographer covering a variety of events from triathlons to weddings, and this camera will do it all! I've owned two of the 10d, 20d, and 30d and have been pleased with all. But I believe this current model represents a bigger jump from the previous models. It feels more robust, is faster, and the image quality is excellent. There are a few things that a 1dmIII or a 5D could better, but if you want a camera that can do it all, well this is it. I would like to point out to people buying there first DSLR for just a hobby a few things. This camera and whatever lens you have on it will draw attention to you. There is no way to pack light. You will spend at least $3000 more on flashes and lenses to scratch the surface of the canon line-up of accessories(if your only going to buy 1 lens, don't buy an SLR, multiple lenses are the whole point). You also must be willing to learn some basics of photography (aperture, shutterspeed, and ISO as a bare minimum)or this camera will just fustrate you. In all, this camera is a well made tool that is worth the price if you need it.

Title: GOOD, BASIC LAPTOP - BUT NO MICROPHONE!
Content:
A little disappointed as I recently ordered and received from amazon this Acer AS5732Z-4867 and was satisfied that it was a good, basic laptop, at a budget price.  However, I discovered today, that Acer was good enough to give me a nice, integrated webcam with this model, but NO microphone, only a microphone jack to connect an external mic.  When shopping for laptops, I am in the habbit of searching the specs to see if one includes a webcam and not whether it comes with a built-in mic as well.  A built-in mic would be on most laptops, I thought, especially if it comes with a webcam.  Not so with this model.  If you are going to use the webcam for Skype or Messenger or other communications, you will have to know sign language or the other party will have to lip read unless you are willing to buy the external mic to plug into the microphone jack.
UPDATE:  Purchased this mic Olympus  ME-52 Noise Cancellation Microphone from amazon and use it with the included black windscreen cover via the mic jack (without the extension cord).  It works very well, but would have preferred the built-in kind.

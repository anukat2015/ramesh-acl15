Title: Liked 1st one so I'm buying a 2nd one
Content:
I received my 1st 1500-Watt Quartz Heater and tried it out during an early cold snap and it worked fine.  I had another place in mind for a 2nd unit and based on what I saw with the first, I decided to order a 2nd one.  
I initially ordered this product based on some other positive reviews that I read elsewhere. I'm not giving it 5-stars for the simple fac that I haven't had the unit long enough for a fair evaluation but my initial impression is good which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  I paid just under $60.00 for each unit, plus shipping of around $10.00/

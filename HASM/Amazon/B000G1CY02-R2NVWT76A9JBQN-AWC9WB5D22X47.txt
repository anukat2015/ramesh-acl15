Title: Great silent heat!
Content:
I bought this heater for a small drafty back bedroom in a 1912 building.  So far it's fantastic.  Heats up silently and immediately.  I find the dial controls totally sufficient; when the room heats to your liking, you just turn the thermostat a bit and the heater holds that temp in the room.  You do not need to be sitting next to it to get the benefits - after a little time the whole room will heat up.  I especially like how lightweight and portable it is.  It's also a slick look.  The perfect solution to my drafty back bedroom issues.  But I like it so much that I'm thinking I'll experiment with keeping my condo's whole temp lower than normal and turning this thing on in whatever room I occupy.

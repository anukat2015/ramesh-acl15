Title: Great, teensy!
Content:
I don't know much about Ipods, I bought this as a gift. The recipient is very happy with it. The thing is so teensy & lightweight. From what I've seen, you can access the music in a variety of different ways, by genre, band, song name, album, etc. You can also play video.
I was concerned that the "shake" feature to switch songs might be irritating if it were too sensitive so that when you were walking or jogging, etc. the song would just constantly switch. But that doesn't seem to be a problem.
On the down side, 8GB doesn't seem to be quite as much storage as he had hoped. And it doesn't seem to be able to hook up to your computer without completely re-syncing your Ipod playlist.

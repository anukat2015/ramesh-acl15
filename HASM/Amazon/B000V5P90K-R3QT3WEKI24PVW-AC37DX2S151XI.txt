Title: EOS 40D is a SUPER camera!
Content:
I love my EOS 40D. (I ordered from Amazon and had it in three days).  It's easy to use and the buttons and dials one needs are right at your fingertips.  The menus are easy to navigate too.  It has impressive response time, and the photos are great. It I get a bad one, it's usually something I did and not the camera.  I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for an SLR that's probably a step-up from the Rebels, but not full-blown pro.  Price was nice too.

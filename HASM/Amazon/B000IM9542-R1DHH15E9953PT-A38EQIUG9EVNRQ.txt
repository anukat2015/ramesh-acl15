Title: Not a quality product
Content:
So I got this product, and it worked great for a few months.  Then all of a sudden sound stopped coming out of both ear buds, and would only come out of one.   No problem I thought, I'll just get a different pair of ear buds.    Nope....same issue.    I don't know about you, but I don't like listening to things and having the sound in only one ear.

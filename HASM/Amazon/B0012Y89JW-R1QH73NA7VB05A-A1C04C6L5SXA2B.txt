Title: For the newbies...
Content:
Much has been said about this camera. And almost all are positive reviews. So if you're still hesitating to purchase this camera, you're already missing half of your life. Take my word for it, just join the bandwagon and buy this! You'll never regret it!
I've taken almost 2000 pictures with this beauty for the two weeks I had it. And I was never let down. It's easy to play with and manipulate the camera. Before, I was intimidated with the different buttons and settings of the DSLR. But now, this camera has brought me closer to a field I once thought I could never learn. The "M" setting I once didn't touch is now what I use often.
I'm leaving the technical shiznits for those who know better. As far as I'm concerned, this is a good stepping stone for those who want to start a hobby or career in photography. The kit lens that comes with it will help you greatly too.

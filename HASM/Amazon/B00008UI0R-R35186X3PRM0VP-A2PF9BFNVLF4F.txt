Title: Great little vacuum cleaner
Content:
Pro
- light and compacts, easy to carry and clean
- great suction
- auto retracting cord. You don't realise how much you need this until you don't have it!
- easy to get out, setup and then store for quick jobs.
Cons
- smallish dust can. I found it needs emptying and cleaning about every 2 weeks in a mid sized house with mostly hardwood and 3 young boys.
- seems well made, but noticed a little loose fit on the metal tube - air hiss and slight wobble.
Unknown
- Reliability? Only had it for a month - no issues yet.

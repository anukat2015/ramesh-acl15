Title: Good but breaks
Content:
Well, this coffee maker was as good as billed but there are some flaws. First, it is very tall so plan on having the vertical space available. More importantly, however, was that it just plain stopped working. Assuming this was a bad wire or something simple (it is a very simple machine in concept - boils water is all) I took the thing apart to find the problem. All wires were fine, there was nothing apparently wrong with it. I kept the carafe and junked the rest. This must have been a manufacturing problem so I got a good 4 months out of the thing and returned to my trusty Capresso.

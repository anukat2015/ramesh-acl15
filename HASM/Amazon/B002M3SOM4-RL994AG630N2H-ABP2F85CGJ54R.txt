Title: Oh, Forget This!
Content:
This is my third iPod shuffle; I've been using a shuffle for years and love it.
I also love my third-party headphones. My second shuffle died after 2 1/2 years of heavy duty use so I bought the new shuffle.
After charging it up and loading it with songs I discovered that the only way to pause, play, or skip is to fondle the headphone cord off my right ear; and even if I weren't a lefty this is a silly design. I should be able to use any headphones I want.
I tried out the horrible, horrible Apple headphones (the ones that hurt and never stay put in my ears) to see if I could live with it but yucko . . . I could only stand the headphones for about 3/4 of a song before I put everything back into the box and took it back to the Apple store.
Apple, I love my iPhone and my Macbook but this design is terrible. Bring back the old design!

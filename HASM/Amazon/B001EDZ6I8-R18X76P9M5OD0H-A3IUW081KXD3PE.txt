Title: Wish I had ordered one for myself!
Content:
I ordered this foot heater for my mother who has just moved to Minnesota to live with my sister.  She LOVES it and uses it all the time!  She sits with it on the porch and drapes a blanket across her lap and stays nice and warm!  I wish I'd thought to get one for myself  I have to have a footrest under my desk and am ALWAYS freezing - this would be ideal, especially since it also has a "cool" air setting.

Title: Excellent Heater
Content:
I used this little heater to warm a 10' X 12' room in New England last winter and it worked great.  This was the only heat source in the room and even my infant and toddler grandchildren were comfortable.  The "flames" look very realistic and add a warm glow to the room.  This a fan-forced heater is much more efficient than the oil-filled heaters I used previously (more heat output for the same cost in electricity).  It has three settings: high heat, low heat, and flame only.  I have enjoyed my safe, durable, inexpensive and decorative Dimplex stove for over a year and highly recommend it.

Title: Negative Reviews Are Incorrect
Content:
The negatives reviews are all wrong.  I have owned this coffee maker for 1 year (2009).  I have had no issues with it (no drips, leaks, etc.).  It is the ideal design, no need to pull it out from under the cabinet. I can't even complain about the customer service.  I accidently broke the craft.  I called the 1-800 and had a representative immediately.  I had the craft a week later.  It was actually cheaper than I expected!

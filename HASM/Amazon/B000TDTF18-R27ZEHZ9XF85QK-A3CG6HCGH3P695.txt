Title: Exactly what I needed!
Content:
We were looking for a good inexpensive coffee maker to replace one that broke on us. The DeLonghi was a great fit. Really convenient is the front loading feature. We have placed the coffee maker on our counter top but under a cupboard. The front loading makes it easier for us as we do not have to pull the machine out to prepare it.
Excellent product.

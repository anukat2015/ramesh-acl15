Title: Main dial never worked?
Content:
I bought this product a little over a year ago but did not get to the creative functions until recently.  When I tried to use the main dial it did not work.  The camera has been meticulously cared for and has never been dropped, bumped, etc.  Canon charged me $200 to fix (I was 8 days outside their warranty but they wouldn't budge).  $200 to fix a piece of plastic on a $600 camera... 
The camera takes nice pictures but should be fairly expensive to operate at $200 per year...
Last Canon product I'll ever buy.

Title: Light, efficient, great engineering
Content:
We use this vacuum on wood floors, carpets with a low shag and stairs.  It is easy to use, compact in size, light to carry and very well designed.  The extra parts (various suction pieces) fit easily and logically without having to struggle to find a place for them or worry about losing the loose pieces when not in use.  The vacuum is relatively quiet and powerful.  It does its job very well and seems to be well constructed.  I wish all products were this well thought out.

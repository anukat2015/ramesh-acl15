Title: amazing suction
Content:
I have bought many vacuum cleaners over the years, including Kirby, Electrolux, Hoover, Miele, Dyson Ball, but not a single one of these has the suction power that the Dyson Canister Vacuum, Mod.12446-02 DC21, has. It is amazing. Everything, from on-board tools to the extending wand, has been thoroughly thought-out. The rug attachment on this canister did a better job on my carpets than ANY of the other vacuum cleaners I've ever owned.  I will NEVER buy another one.

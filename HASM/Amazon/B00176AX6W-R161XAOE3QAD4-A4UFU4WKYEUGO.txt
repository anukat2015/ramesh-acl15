Title: Everything you every wanted.
Content:
It works. Most of the other reviewers have exhausted the features. The best part about this is that it works. I can give no better statement than this. Software is intuitive, easy to use. No drm hassles from using it on different machines, unlike ipod. Yes, I did buy this to replace an 80gb 5.5 gen ipod video. I am so happy. This thing works right, and above all, does not seem to be a 'make and abandon' tech as Microsoft updates enhance functionality, not cripple. Do get this. I guarantee you will not regret it.

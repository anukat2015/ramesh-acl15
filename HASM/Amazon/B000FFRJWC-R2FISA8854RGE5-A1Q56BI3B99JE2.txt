Title: I cannot recommend this.
Content:
I bought this vacuum about two years ago for somewhere around $125. Had I been able to use it prior to purchase, I definitely wouldn't have bought it.
First, the good:
* it's bagless, which I think is a very much overrated feature
* I like the handle design
* it works better than the 20 year old eureka hand me down I was using prior, though that's hardly a rave review
Now, the bad:
* the filter clogs, constantly. I don't have any pets or kids and I have a relatively low traffic household, yet it seems like every time I take this vacuum out I have to clean out that foam dust filter. It goes from working somewhat well to not working at all in about twenty minutes of use
* the attachements fall off, constantly.
* the cord management area is frustratingly cramped
* I cannot get the vacuum to work well on a hard (tile) floor. I've tried three times to use it in my kitchen and dining room and each time I've had to go back with a broom as the vacuum was completely ineffective
I don't consider myself an unrealistic person, but I was and am still very disappointed in this vacuum. If a friend were to tell me they were going to buy this vacuum because it was all they could afford, I'd tell them to borrow mine for a week and let them re-think their budget.

Title: OK coffee, some design issues though...
Content:
I had this coffee maker for three years or so and unfortunately it just bit the dust. While it was working it made perfectly decent coffee (ALWAYS use the brew-select button) but now the door holding the coffee grounds doesn't close because the latch broke.
We're too broke right now to get a new coffee maker, so we're using duct-tape to keep the door closed in the meantime.
While it was working it was alright though -- not great, just alright.

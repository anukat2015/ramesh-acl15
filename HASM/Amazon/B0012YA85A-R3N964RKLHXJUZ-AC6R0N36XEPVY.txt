Title: first time DSLR owner
Content:
If you do a search on reviews of this camera you will find a lot of first time DSLR buyers deciding to get this camera.  I am one of them.  After years of Point and Shoot camera use thinking the convenience of carrying them and using them was worth it, I came to the realization that I  wasn't happy with most of the pictures I took.  They preserved the moment but almost none of them were worth blowing up or printing.  Mediocre flash, zoom, megapixels, etc limited me and the pictures. 
I love all the features of this camera for the price, especially the dedicated ISO button on top and the menu system is very easy to figure out, and the 3 inch LCD screen.  There is also the switch to SD memory cards which are apparently easier to use than CF.  It is so easy to take the card out, put it in an SD USB card reader, load the pictures and return the card to the camera, rather than have to fiddle around with opening the little door on the camera and connecting a cable from it to the PC.
If you are contemplating buying your first DSLR you must remember that the camera is just the start.  You will need to invest in a quality external flash to improve your flash pictures.  And there is the various zoom lens, that now utilize Image or Optical Stabilization, a technology worth the extra cost.  I was happy to do all this and I am absolutely satisfied with this camera and the Canon lens and flash as well.  I now am very happy with carrying a bigger but absolutely superior camera

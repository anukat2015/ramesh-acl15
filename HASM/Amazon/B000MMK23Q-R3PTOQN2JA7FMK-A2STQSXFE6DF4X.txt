Title: Ineffecient and expensive, but offers quality heat and is safe
Content:
The Edenpure is inefficient in its heating capacities and more expensive than it claims to be, but it is good quality heat and safe for children.  
I bought the EdenPure Gen3 1000, which claims to heat 1,000 square feet, covering all areas of the space evenly, which is definitely a stretch of the truth.  I use the EdenPure primarily as a supplemental heat source (in addition to our woodstove and oil furnace) to heat our bedroom at night, which is 144 square feet, and it just about heats that.  For example, after having the EdenPure facing into the bedroom at highest temperature for 5 hours of the night, the temperature of the room in the morning (on a cold winter day) was only 64 degrees.  If it were to heat 1,000 square feet, then the majority of our 1,400 square foot home should be warm, but that is not the case.  I am confident other space heaters could keep a small room similarly warm for under $100 (compared to $397 for EdenPure).    
I am troubled by EdenPure's claims of the expense of it only costing as much as a cup of coffee per day, that is, unless if coffee is expensive to heat!  EdenPure Gen3 1000 operates at 1.236 killowatt-hours, which equates to 18 cents per hour where I live in Upstate New York.  Use it 10 hours per day and expect to pay an extra 2 dollars per day in electricity. Expect to tack on 30 to 60 dollars to your electricity bill each month if you use it in the aforementioned manner.
As to the EdenPure's claim that the heat does not take the oxygen and humidity out of the air, there appears to be truth to this claim.  As a sinus sufferer, I do not notice great improvement in my sinuses from using the EdenPure given its limited heat it emits, but the air does seem more moist.
However, I do believe one claim EdenPure makes that is appropriate, which is that it is safe, unlike many other space heaters.  This is the primary reason I plan to keep my EdenPure Gen3 1000, despite its costs.  I have three young children, all under age 4, and this heater does not get hot - ever.  The grill part of the heater gets warm, but the heater as a whole does not get hot.  It is not a safety risk to your home nor to your children, so that is the primary advantage of this heater, in my opinion.

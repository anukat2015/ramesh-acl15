Title: Not Toasty At All
Content:
Our company is buying us these in an effort to save money by getting us to take our space heaters home. I've had mine set up as a heating panel (positioned vertically) under my desk for three days and I even forgot it was there because I don't feel any heat. Now I just laid it flat on the floor in the high heat position, and I can feel a little heat coming through my shoes. That's okay if you can sit with your feet perfectly flat and don't move, but I can't sit like that for long.
I'm glad I didn't pay for this. I'm keeping my space heater.

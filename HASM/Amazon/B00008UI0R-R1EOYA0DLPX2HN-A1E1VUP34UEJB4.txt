Title: OK, but needs some work!
Content:
The suction on this vacuum is unbeatable.  I also like the cord length and the handle attached to the top of the cannister. The things I find remiss are: 1) the weight...I find myself preparing to lift it with a mighty heave each time I have to move it; 2) the size of the dust collector...it's very small and seems to need emptying several times during my cleaning; 3)  the upholstery attachment...doesn't seem to do the best job; 4)  the filter cleaning...  a real annoyance because you have to use the provided brush on every fold of the filter; and 5) the wand...it's unwieldy and difficult to move especially when 
it's on the highest suction level.  Given a second opportunity, I don't think I would purchase this vacuum again.

Title: Warning: Don't buy this awful product !!!
Content:
Warning:  I bought this space heater a little over 9 months ago for use under my desk at work and it has just died.  *** It didn't even last a whole year!!! ***  I just called Midway customer service & they indicated that I was on my own -- that they don't warranty that their products will last any length of time before they stop working.
When it *was* working, it was consistently either too hot (in a *tiny* area), or else it kept shutting off if you reduce the temperature (it incorrectly sensed that the space under my desk was already warm enough when it wasn't).  It doesn't oscillate, and so it doesn't effectively keep you warm.
I'd definitely recommend getting a different heater, from a different manufacturer & different company, that works better -- and lasts at least a year before it stops working & you need to go out & buy a replacement.

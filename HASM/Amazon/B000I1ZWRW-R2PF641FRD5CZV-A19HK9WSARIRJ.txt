Title: My Thoughts About The Canon XTi
Content:
I have medium size hands and this camera fits nicely. I like the larger fonts and LCD screen, being 58 my eyes need a little help . The settings are easy to find and change. The battery life is great, you can shoot all day long. Using a lens with IS cuts it down a little. 
I like all of the adjustments for the picture styles, you can change the contrast, saturation, sharpness or color tone. You can even make your personal settings and save them. For being the cheapest Canon DSLR this is a great camera. I have three Canon digitals the G3, 300D, and 400D and I like them all.

Title: Great suchtion and that's it!
Content:
I've only owned Kenmore vacs previously and am sorry I switched.  This vacuum has great suction, but that is where it's attributes end.  I've only owned my vacuum six months and have already had to take it in for a new motor.  I do vacuum every day, but my house is small.  The wheels are too small so that when you are pulling it behind you, it's almost easier to just carry the darn thing.  I think the on board attachments are a pain to get at, and the hardwood floor attachment was so cruddy that I was thrilled to see that my Kenmore attachment fit so I could use that one.
This is not a vacuum I would ever consider purchasing again.  I guess I am going back to Kenmore.

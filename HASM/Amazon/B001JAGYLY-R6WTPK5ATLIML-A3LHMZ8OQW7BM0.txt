Title: Suction is below average; plastic parts at critical locations.
Content:
Bought this vacuum cleaner to replace Dyson DC07(upright). Suction is way below average especially on bare floors (when the power head is turned off). Had to do a minor repair to the power head already. When I was vacuuming a rug, the power head caught some edge ornament (loose short ropes) and the brush stopped rotating. Had to open the power head and reinstall the rubber belt that came off. Also the wand is attached to the power head through a plastic tubular connector that is probably not going to last (this is the place where my previous Fanton Lightning canister vacuum broke).
Disappointed due to low suction.

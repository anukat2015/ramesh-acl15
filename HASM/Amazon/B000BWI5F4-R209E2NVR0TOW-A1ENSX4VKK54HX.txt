Title: More Pluses than Minuses
Content:
I am pleased with the portability of the lightweight Bosch vacuum I purchased. It's a breeze to carry to the room needing cleaning - a big plus for me.  I'm not as happy with way it reacts to being pulled along; it often takes several tries to get it where I need it to go.  The power of this unit is good; it picks up dust, dirt and debris as good as most and better than some I've had. I would give it four stars out of five.

Title: best vacuum ever
Content:
I just ordered this vacuum after a lot of research.  I was tired of the baggless upright that I have been getting the past couple of years.  Anyway, this vacuum is such a pleasure!  First of all, I have a "Marley" dog who is a shedding machine.  I hate dog fur more than anything, and I needed a vacuum that would pick up a Labrador Retrievers hair.  They are like hairs sticking to velcro, and no other vacuum could even touch the hairs on my carpet.  However, this vacuum picks up every single hair - it is unbelievable.  It also blows out clean, fresh smelling air...which is such a pleasure!  I love all of the attachments too!  But, my favorite part is probably how easy it is to adjust the height of the vacuum. I am only 5"1 where my husband is 6'0. So, we both need different heights. It is lightweight, yet durable.  I also have a combination of hardwood and carpet, so it is easy to turn the rollers off with the switch when I am moving from room to room!!
I really think this vacuum is worth the money and seems like a much more upscale vacuum then its price lets on!

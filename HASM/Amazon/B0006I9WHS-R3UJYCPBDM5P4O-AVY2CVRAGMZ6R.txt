Title: Junk
Content:
I only gave this one star because there was not an option for zero stars.  This lasted 3 weeks until it broke.  I bought it during the summer, getting ready for winter. By the time I opened the box, my Amazon 30day warranty expired and the manufacturer requires a fee to send it back to them.  Long story short, I'd be out another $15 to get this piece of junk replaced.  It's not worth more than five dollars new, seriously, it's a total piece of JUNK.  I'm sticking to the oil-filled radiator heaters.  DeLonghi is the BEST, I've had several of them, each lasts about 5+ years and you can get one for $50 on Amazon, with free shipping.  And the oil-filled radiators are alot easier on the electric bill.  Don't waste your time on this piece of junk forced-air Honeywell heater.  If you decide to take a chance on buying it, be sure to open it Right Away, so that hopefully you'll be covered by your 30day Amazon warranty when it breaks.

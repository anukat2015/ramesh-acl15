Title: good looks, but no substance
Content:
I purchased this vacuum for my small apartment.  It is compact and has a playful orange design.  As others have mentioned, the vacuum cleaner sunction is average at best and parts do tend to feel cheap.  The retractable cord is no longer working -- only after a few uses.  The biggest problem for me is that the vacuum exhaust smells badly, and the entire apartment needs to be aired out for 1/2-1 hour to get rid of any residual smell from vacuuming.  I'll be leaving my apartment in a month, and will leave the vacuum cleaner behind with a "Free" sign on it.

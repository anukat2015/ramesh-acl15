Title: the electric start DOES NOT work
Content:
I have been searching for an affordable portable cook top/burner WITH electric start for a while, until I saw this one. After I see the positive review, I ordered it right away. 
But I was so disappointed after using it. I don't know if I get a defective item or not(the seller refuses to admit it is a defective if it is.) The fact is, I have been using it for 2 months now, and during these time frame, the electric start works a handful times at most. (But everyday  I tried several times to start it. So you do the calculation.) Will never purchase from this seller or this company any more.

Title: 3 out of 5 have broken.
Content:
These heaters have a great design.  They are quiet, heat a room quickly, and don't dry out the air as other heaters do. They just don't last very long.  I bought five of them, three are broken.  The construction materials are not as good as the design, and they are not repairable.
I would like to buy this type of heater from a manufacturer that uses lasting quality parts.

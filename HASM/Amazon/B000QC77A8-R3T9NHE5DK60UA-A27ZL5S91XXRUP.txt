Title: we like it
Content:
We have used this heater for two years now we bought it at walmart. we went one day and they were fully stocked, went back the next day to buy one and we ended up with the floor model.  I wish someone with a drafty house would review this so I would know whether it works well in that situation as well. we only have to heat three or four hundred square foot and this is our only heater (Kentucky) it works well even with our vaulted ceilings as long as we use the ceiling fans.  I like the features it offers and the thermostat, plus you can direct the blower for the heat so you can point it at your body if you are personally cold at the moment.  I liked the design it doesn't look like a scarry heater and none of us have ever been able to get burned by it even though the air that comes out is very warm.  It does make noise, but is not annoying or loud.  Overall it was a great buy for our purposes.

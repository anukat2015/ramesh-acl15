Title: 2 Out of 5 Broke
Content:
We bought 5 of this model for our office, but at least 2 out of the 5 broke over time, all the same way.  The power buttons broke.  
I am certain that 2 broke because I've seen them.  The others disappeared, possibly some have been thrown away because they are broken.  
We had to keep pushing until the power button contacts correctly to turn on and off.  Sometimes I mindlessly push for 5 minutes while working until it turns on, sometimes I give up.  Eventually one of the heater button just sunk in the hole.
I have the other model at home with the light switch type of power button.  That never had any problem.

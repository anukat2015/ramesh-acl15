Title: Love This Vac!
Content:
Surprised that this has received so many negative reviews.  I've had many Black & Deckers, and none have had anywhere near the power that this has.  We have a cat that sheds, and I used to have to put towels or mats on his favorite chairs.  Now we've tossed the ugly towels - this vac gets all the hair off the upholstered chairs.  Even when it doesn't appear to have much hair, this vac will s.u.c.k up tons of hair.  
Also love how well it cleans the cars. Before, I had to use standard canister vac to clean the cars because B&D handheld was not powerful enough, and lost the charge too quickly.  Now we just use this unit, so much easier than dragging out a full size vac.
Agree with others that charging mount unit should have been included.  Would be way more convenient to be able to mount it on the wall.  Also agree that the dirt "cup" is messy to empty.  I take it outside, dump dirt out, then use a brush to clean the filter.  But, the power of this unit more than makes up for the shortcomings, esp being able to clean cat hair off furniture and use on cars. Very convenient.

Title: Great camera for wildlife and birds in flight
Content:
I own both the 7D and the 5D MkII. The 5D2 excells at high IQ and great high-ISO performance and the 7D excells at fast focus, bringing the subject closer and getting off bursts of images at high frame rates. Both are very fine all around cameras, but the 7D helps you by filling its viewfinder with a larger image, locking on focus quicker and allowing a much faster burst rate. I've been somewhat amazed at the 7D's perfomance at ISO 6400, but find it second to the 5D2 at ISOs of 1600 and 3200. Below ISO 800 the two perform very closely, but the difference is more noticeable in that 1600-3200 band. Hey, at least we're not talking about shooting birds in flight at ASA 50!
The build quality is at the tank level. I've had it out in rain and snow and temperatures as low as -15F. I really like that the 7D and 5D2 share the same battery, so by keeping a charged battery in each body and a spare, I'm never short of power. I often take 1000 images in a day with the 7D and always have plenty of reserves (I hardly ever use Live View). The control layout is slightly improved over the 5D2, with the video operation being much more intuitive.
I'd suggest that anyone having IQ trouble with the 7D make sure that they check their micro-focus adjustment and fine tune it to their particular lenses. There is quite a range of potential adjustment, which might explain the trouble that a few seem to be having. (Mine required no micor-adjustment).

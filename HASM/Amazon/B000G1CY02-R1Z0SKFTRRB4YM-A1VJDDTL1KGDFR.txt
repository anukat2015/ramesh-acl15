Title: Everything I expected.
Content:
This heater works fast and warms a room throughout.  You don't have to sit directly in front of it to feel warm. I'm running it in my upstairs bedroom (20x14).  On the high setting will raise the room temperature 8 to 10 degrees in less the 45 minutes and that's in Central New Hampshire in Fall.  Can easily be mounted onto the wall without worrying about heat damage to the wall.  Bring up the temp quickly on high then lower to maintain temp.  I would recommend this unit to anyone.

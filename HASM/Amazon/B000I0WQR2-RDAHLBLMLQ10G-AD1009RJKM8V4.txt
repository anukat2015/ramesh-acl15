Title: Worth The Price of Admission!!!!
Content:
This heater heats up very quickly.....about a minute and a half. It outputs more heat than my oil filled heater ever did and the handles stay cool to the touch and it's light weight. Just remember to do a burn-in for 2 hours or so to burn off residual residue from the manufacturing process. You will see a little smoke rising from the unit when turned on for the first time. Place it near an open window or door during burn-in. It has a relatively high price tag but it's worth it in my opinion. The thermostat works flawlessly. Highly recommended!!!!

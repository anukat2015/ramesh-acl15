Title: No service centers for Pinguino products
Content:
I purchased a Pinguino PAC 700T 3 years ago.  Rated at 12,000 BTUs, it cools about as well as a 6000 BTU in-window unit.  However, at the beginning of this summer season, I find that it no longer cools or dehumidifies air.  I found DeLonghi's central service number (800-322-3848 in case you need it) and asked for my nearest service/repair center.  They informed me that they no longer have any repair centers in Massachusetts.  They suggested that I take the unit to Hartford, CT, about 2 hours from Boston where I live.  Having paid $1300 for this unit just 3 years ago, I expected better service than this.  It appears that DeLonghi maybe doesn't care too much about supporting their products after the sale.  This will be my last DeLonghi product of any kind.

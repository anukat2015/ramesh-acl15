Title: A space heater for a VERY limited space
Content:
This thing is nice and toasty if you sit right in front of it.  But, if you move 3 feet away, you no longer feel the heat.  Does not seem to heat up a room.  When sitting on the couch, it's nice and warm when placed on the coffee table right in front of me.  But, the person sitting 2 feet away next to me can't feel it.  Probably would work great for putting under a desk at work.

Title: It stinks
Content:
This vacuum has great suction, but cleaning the filter and the cup are a big pain.  I have a dog and every time I vacuum I have to open the windows and air out the house because it stinks.  I can't find a replacement filter, so I wash it with vinegar, rinse with water and set it in the sun to dry.  My husband hates it and wants to buy a different vacuum, but I don't want to give up the suction.  If you have pets, I'd avoid it.

Title: It just gets better and better
Content:
The difference between this computer and my last Mac Laptop, a titanium PowerBook G4, is about time and light, speed and agility.  The MacBook Pro is all brighter, sharper, and more beautiful.  The screen opens with just a slight touch and the picture is all there in all colors. The screen is like an endless pool - no sharp edges, filled with light and color.
The display was very important to me and that is why I chose this over the other models.  Side by side, the pictures are like night and day.  There is no comparison.
One of the most interesting changes is how intuitive and insightful the new trackpad is.  This trackpad allows a variety of new moves, including using two fingers or more at a time - even for scrolling.  
Light up keyboard.  Never even knew I needed it though it probably won't be convenient outside.
This computer is bigger and faster, as fast as a computer could be.  I always wonder why a computer would need to go any faster but the next one always does.  Do we get faster?  Or does the endless quest for more speed just make us think we do?
Concerns:
There is a fragility to this that I don't remember ever noticing with my PowerBook.  My PowerBook has traveled in backpacks and briefcases and may even have been thrown in a purse from time to time.   (Much worse has happened to it.)  I even fell off an icy ledge once, with it in my backpack, and it survived.  Cats have slept on the PowerBook, open and closed.  Drinks have been spilled.  The Powerbook is like a workhorse whereas the MacBook Pro seems a little too delicate to throw in a backpack.
This is my third Macintosh and the best so far.  I was reluctant to leave behind my PowerBookG4 as it moves onto the boat for a second life as a navigator.  Luckily I'll still have weekend privileges.

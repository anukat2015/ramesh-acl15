Title: Simply the Best!!!
Content:
Quite a few years back, my wife and I were given this product as a Christmas present, and although a little skeptical at first, it has proven itself worthy of its name, and we've had three of them since then.  They are just the best.  If you want a quick cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, this is the baby for you.  Plus, we've used it to heat up hot water when our babies were first born, and it came in really handy, as opposed to getting the water boiling on the stove.  And you know how long that can take.
A marvelous product, and I hope they keep it around.  It's a wonder!!!

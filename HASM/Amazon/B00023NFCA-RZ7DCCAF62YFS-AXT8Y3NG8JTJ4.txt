Title: Maxxum 7d
Content:
Not too many of these cameras left out there for sale. It was the digital version of the Maxxum 7 film camera.
I'm very happy with the pictures it takes, particularly in low light. This is a benefit of the 6mp sensor, which nowadays seems like a low figure, but unless you want to go much larger than 8 by 10 prints, shouldn't be an issue.
What I want to warn people about are a couple of problems with the electronics. The 7d has a known problem of first frame black, the shutter doesn't fire the first time it is used, then you turn it off and back on again and it will work. 
Eventually though it will stop working.
The other problem is with the anti-shake mechanism. The camera will refuse to take a picture while the anti-shake lights go off in the view finder, accompanied by a whirring noise.
Both these problems can be fixed, normally by Precision Camera. It will cost you though. I was lucky enough to get one that had been fixed, and was still under the warranty from Precision. Ask the seller about these problems.

Title: Good, could have been great
Content:
I would have given this Laptop a 5/5 if HP had not messed up the track pad so bad. Its terrible, I dont know how HP could let this thing into the market. 
Otherwise this Laptop is awesome, it everything a cheap thin and light should be. I got mine for $500, so Im reviewing it from that price point. Mac Book Pro 13" might have better processor, speakers, and a built in dvd drive, but its $800 more. This is a great Laptop if your looking for something cheap, light, and small. You cant play Crysis and you cant watch blu ray dvds, but it does what it is meant to do, and it does it well. Battery life isnt great, but I got about 5 hours using MS word and surfing the web (no video playback), and about 3 hours watching video.  
I think The next generation of this laptop could be amazing if HP can just fix the track pad and a few other minor flaws

Title: Great PC, but pretty large for use on airplane
Content:
I think this PC is great.  The screen is very clear, it works every time I turn it on, and I like the feel of the keyboard. 
Pros:
1. Big enough to read screen.
2. Screen really clear.
3. Keyboard has nice feel.
4. Mouse pad has nice feel.
5. Nice feature set.
6. Great price for all of these features.
Cons:
1. 12 cell battery makes it stick  up in the back (you may think this is a plus if you use it on a desk all the time and like the angle).
2. It's kind of heavy especially with bigger battery.
3. It is difficult to open all the way on an airplane especially if the person in front of you is rude and leans back into your workspace.
4. Wireless is not very good.  I get better reception on my old "g" Dell notebook on same wireless-N router.  I thought this one would be better since it has wireless-N built in.
I also want to praise Amazon for their quick shipping and excellent customer service.  I needed the computer quickly for a trip and they made it happen.

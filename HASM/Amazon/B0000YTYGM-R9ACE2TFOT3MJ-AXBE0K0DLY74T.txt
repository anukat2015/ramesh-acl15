Title: Going on 6 years now
Content:
We have had this coffeemaker for almost 6 years.  Before this coffeemaker we went through at least 1 and sometimes 2 new coffeemakers a year.
- Does it clog up and overflow -- yes, and when it does it is ugly, very, very ugly.  I run a couple of cups of vinegar through the system every 4 - 6 weeks.  Keeps it from clogging and refreshes the system for a great cup of coffee.
-  Is the carafe hard to clean -- oh yes.  That said I just found a great curved coffeepot cleaner brush.  It is definately helping with the build up but it would have been better to be using the brush from day one.
-  Does it have a loud beep -- yes, music to my ears every morning.
The negatives are far outweighed by the quality of this coffeemaker.  It makes a great cup of coffee and we will never use anything but a thermal carafe again.
Go ahead, buy it and love it for years to come.

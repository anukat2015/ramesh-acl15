Title: Things to keep in mind with this heater
Content:
I have 3 of these "Mr. Heater Portable Buddy" propane heaters used for a variety of back-up and supplemental heating purposes. First, be aware that if you use the standard 1.02 pound propane cylinder, you're looking at 3 hours "max" on the high 9,000 BTU setting and roughly 6 hours "max" on the low 4,500 BTU setting. 
So too, getting the hang of starting the thing takes some getting used to or you'll be there the proverbial year and a day clicking the automatic igniter! Put the red control lever on "pilot" and press all the way down and "hold" it there for at least 10 to 12 seconds allowing the propane to simply reach the igniter and 'then' click the igniter. When it ignites, let the red control lever up ==VERY SLOWLY== otherwise it will go out! 
Finally, after protracted usage, you may notice that no matter what you do, the new 1.02 pound cylinder simply refuses to screw in properly and this can be due to long-term wear and tear of the heater cylinder receptacle threads so if it gets to the point that new cylinder after cylinder refuses to screw in, get a FUEL FILTER made for the heater and that will generally go in there without problem with the other end being essentially a new threaded receiving receptacle! It beats not using the heater because it refuses to accept any 1.02 pound cylinders due to thread problem issues in the stock receptacle! Fuel filter part is F273699 [specifically for Buddy heaters] and runs about $8.00. 
Obviously you can also use the big 20 pound cylinder but in that case you need the hose connecter [which is not cheap] and you should 'never' use a '20' pound propane cylinder indoors! But then too, even with the small and convenient 1.02 pound standard cylinders, a carbon monoxide detector is recommended .... just in case.

I agree with the reviews about Fingerprints and touch pad on the T135-1307.  Had 4 or 5 issues from the git-go that was getting worse.  Was advised by Toshiba's Tec support to do a system restore.  Did and it solved software Issues and setteled down touchpad. Support was easy to work with.
    After adjusting sound found it very impressive.  Volume fair but adequate.  Gave me a surround sound, stero effect.  Impressed!  Had two issues since restore where I couldn't get anything to work. Removed battery twice to correct problem. Appeared to be an I'm in control battle between Win 7 and Nortons (Alpha Dog).  Have been advised that Nortons slows computer down.  However, really can't complain. Nortons has been working quietly and seamless.  This is a good computer, quick, quiet, with great battery life.  Ordered a cheap external CD drive to load programs.  Am looking to borrow an external burner to make restore CD's.  Toshiba makes a good product. I would give it 5 stars if the touch pad and clicker were easier to operate, and if Toshiba Satellite T135-S1307 TruBrite 13.3-Inch Ultrathin Black Laptop - 9 Hours 22 Minutes of Battery Life (Windows 7 Home Premium)it came with a CD ROM. I feel it is a good purchase.  Went on sale for $21 less two days after it arrived. We have a 2 year old Toshiba 135 Satellite with Vista that still operates great. I actually bought the T135-1307 for my wife but she has been slow to migrate from old larger Satellite.

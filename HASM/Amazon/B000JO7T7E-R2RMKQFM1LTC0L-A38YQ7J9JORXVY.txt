Title: Hey, it's an iPod!
Content:
What can I say, Apple designs most of its products quite well; nice appearance with pragmatic functionality...and the iPod is no exception.
I have seen quite a few other MP3 players (my brother owns a Zen Micro), but none seem to match up to the iPod.  I think what impresses me most are the extras: calendar, contacts, games, alarm, stopwatch, etc.  The only difficult thing is picking the color!
I definitely recommend going with the 8 GB model - might as well, considering the price difference.  You may also want to consider an alternate pair of earbuds or headphones.  As others have noted, the pair that come with the iPod might not fit very well.  This is one area where Apple really needs to look at design/functionality with something that comes in the box.
Other than that, if you're concerned about potential damage/scratches, I would order a sleeve at the same time, and put it on right away.

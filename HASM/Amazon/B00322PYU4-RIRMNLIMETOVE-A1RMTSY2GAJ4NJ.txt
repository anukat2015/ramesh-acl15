Title: one touch web access .... NOT
Content:
I bought this model of sony vaio on 3/10/10. I read the reviews and product description before I bought it. And I like what it says, so I ordered it. Now that I have it  I was disappointed to find out it does not have a one touch web access. This is one of the reason that I chosen this model of sony laptop. In their product description "The CW also features fast, one-touch access to the Internet without booting up the operating system--just press the "Web" button." I read the manual and this features is not included. So people beware not everything you see in their product description is acctually the one your buying !!!Sony VAIO VPC-CW23FX/L 14-Inch Laptop (Blue)

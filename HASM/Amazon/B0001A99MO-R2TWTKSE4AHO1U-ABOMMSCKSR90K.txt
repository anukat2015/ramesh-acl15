Title: I Pod Mini is worth the money!!
Content:
I just received my IPod Mini yesterday and I am completely enthralled with it.  I am not overly technological and it was so easy to understand!  It is simple to work, small, lightweight, cute as a bug, and holds all my music.  It sounds incredible, like a complete stereo system.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Apple has five gold stars with this product!!

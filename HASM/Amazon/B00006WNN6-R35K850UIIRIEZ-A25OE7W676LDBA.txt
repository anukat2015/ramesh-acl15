Title: Not bad, not great either.
Content:
After staying in a freezing office for way too long, I decided to purchase this item.  I put it under my desk and it keeps me warm while it is on, but the temperature control has it turn off and then I'm cold until it comes on again.  I prefer to have it constantly heat the room until I turn it off.  Like the other reviewer mentioned, it needs an on/off switch.  I must say that it is better than nothing, but I was expecting more.  My co-worker has a small one and that thing can heat up my entire cubicle--I was expecting the same :(

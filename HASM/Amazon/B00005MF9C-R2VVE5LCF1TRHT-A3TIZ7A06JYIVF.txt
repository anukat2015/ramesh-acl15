Title: Love it!
Content:
This is an excellent little item, when you just want one cup of coffee.  Coffee is nice and hot and uses regular ground coffee, built in filter, easy to use and lightweight if you want to take it for travelling.  We originally bought the black and decker home cafe with the pods and hated it.  Coffee was weak, and lukewarm and very noisy.  Took that back and got this and it is just right.  
  Try it you won't be disappointed and the price is great!

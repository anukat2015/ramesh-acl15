Title: Leaks everywhere
Content:
This unit does the job advertised, I will admit that.  It does cool a room very well.  In fact, it keeps the back half of our house nice and cool.
The downside is that it leaks like crazy.  Even with the dehumidifier off.  And I live in El Paso, not exactly a humid area of the country.
The problem seems to mostly stem from the fact that unlike most similar units, the internal tank is not removeable.  This means you can not drain the water off before it overflows the tank.
To make it worse, there is a drain hole in the rear of the unit.  But hooking up a hose does not good.  It seems it is only made to drain the unit at the end of the season, not for routine use.  This places it to high in the tank to actually drain.
We are seeing roughly a gallon of water a day leaking from this unit.  I just wish I had looked here before I bought it.

Title: I think this is the best unit H B has made of this type
Content:
I have had one of the earlier models (47686), it was hard to poor into when filling the unit. You couldn't see the coffe level very easy. It would shut off after a short time. 
This unit opens up for easy cleaning, easy pour, two sight glasses, can leave it on up to 4 hrs. Keeps the coffee hot. Only thing I wish they had moved the cup filler out a little more, if you have a thick mug, you could miss it. I first bought this for another house, I liked it so much I bought another to replace the 47686 at another place, I liked it so much.

Thoughts
I really enjoy this laptop. I use it every day and haven't really been disappointed with it. Sure the keyboard is a little flimsy, but it isn't anything to worry about. It doesn't hurt typing speed at all. It just has a little give when you press near the middle and then it bounces back. This thing also puts out quite a bit of heat. The main downside to this is that it is all vented out of the right side. This is where I have my wireless mouse, so my hand gets a little sweaty, but the discomfort isn't too bad.
I think the worst feature of the laptop has to be the speakers. They just don't give out good sound. Almost no base and fuzzy noise when it gets louder. This doesn't really affect me though because I use headphones all the time and the sound output is wonderful.
The aluminum is really cool for a few weeks until the fingerprints get everywhere and don't come off easily. It really takes some work to get the oil from your skin off of it, and then it gets right back.
But the good outweighs the bad for my use. I play games on it all the time and they run smooth. Like I said full graphics on Oblivion. It seems to run just about everything at maximum. I doubt it would run Crysis at full, but it would be playable at medium-high I think. If you want a gaming computer and don't want to pay $2000 and have a 25 pound surfboard go with this one.

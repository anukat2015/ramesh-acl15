Title: Heats well, horrible build quality
Content:
I just returned my second Vornado AVH2 the other day. My first one lasted about one night before it developed a serious rattle that was too annoying to handle. I contacted the company I purchased it from and they gave a a prompt exchange. Unfortunately, the replacement heater shared the same fate. After about 3 days of moderate use, the heater started having an even worse rattle than the first one. I am giving up on Vornado heaters, quite a shame since they are made in the USA and thus should have better build quality standards. 
I can tell you that while the heater did work, it did its job very well. It took the chill out of a 50 degree room in about 10 minutes, and constantly kept the room at a comfortable level. It seemed to live up to it's claim of giving you a "blanket of warm air" throughout the room. 
All in all, if you can get lucky and receive a unit that doesn't break or rattle within a couple of days of use, I would recommend this heater. However, two defective heaters in a row for me means I can't give it a good rating!

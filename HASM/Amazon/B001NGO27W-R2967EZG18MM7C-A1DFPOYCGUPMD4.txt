Title: THIS IS THE ONE
Content:
I have used Mr. Coffee makers for years and always liked them. But the last two ones I've tried were a huge disappointment and hassle. They leaked, condensation built up everywhere and ran all over, the carafe dribbled coffee everytime you tried to pour a cup. The pause and serve only worked if you had a hand full of paper towels to wipe up the mess on the hot plate. After reading the reviews on other Mr. Cofeee makers it seems they all have the same problems.
After reading the reviews I decided to try the Cuisinart DCC 2600 because of the features I want in a coffee maker and the capacity. I was really impressed with all the features and it brews 14 cups in about 15 minutes. Everything featured on this unit works like a charm. I sure there may be some bad ones from factory out there but this is not one of them. The charcoal filters are a bit expensive, about like buying ink for a printer. But I have a PUR: water filter on my kitchen sink so there is nothing left to filter.
For the money it can't be beat, the extra $40 over a Mr. Coffee maker is well worth it if you take into account that you'll waste at least that much on defective makers before you decide to spend the little extra and get a good coffee maker. You'll spend at least that much on paper towels. This is my first Cuisinart so I hope it will last for a few years, if it does my next one will be the same.

Title: Good beginer and first DSLR
Content:
This is probably the lowest in the line up of Canon DSLRs and makes a really good first DSLR. I will skip the technical details (since they can be obtained from the Canon website), and get straight to the relavent points.
The camera is nicely designed, light yet packed with features. People with big hands, may find it difficult to use the camera, but since I have relatively small hands, I am not complaining. The layout of buttons and the menu is very clean and simple. The manual is very detailed and I would recommend you read the manual even if you have used a Canon earlier. 
The body is all plastic and feels cheap. I would have really liked if there was say a rubber grip or something that would aid in getting a better hold. The lense that comes with the camera is probably not the best but still gives great shots! I would recommend buying just the body and a good quality lens preferably the image stabilized.
To sum it up, a great camera from Canon at an unbeatable price yet not compromising on features. Great for students and beginners.

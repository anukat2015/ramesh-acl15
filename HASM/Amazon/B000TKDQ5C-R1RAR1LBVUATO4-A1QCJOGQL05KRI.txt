Title: nothing not to like
Content:
I got one of these last year because i wanted a strong heater in a small package, small footprint, to use in my bathroom, because the built in heater stopped working.  It's perfect for heating a small room like that. Then i got another one for my bedroom, it's quiet, strong, and small, it fit into a small space near the bed.   Then, i got a third one for the living room.  The living room is a large room, and i use the heater like a small fire place, it really pumps out the heat. It's not going to heat the whole living room, but sitting next to it feels like sitting next to a small fire for warmth, very pleasant, not too hot when close to it, just a nice strong warmth.  In the living room, the central heating doesn't do that well heating the lower part of the room on a cold night, the heat rises and it can be set on a high temperature and still be cold where we sit, so we use these heaters to warm up our space, nice source of heat, very portable, lightweight, sturdy.  No complaints, it's perfect for what i use it for.

Title: brew station
Content:
It's okay. Expensive but convenient to use. It does require some planning on where to plug in as it uses a considerable amount of energy in a short time and if one is using another appliance, the circuit can trip. I am a little concerned that the plastic containers left after each cup can not be reused. I used to compost the used coffee grounds but have not been able to do so with the new system. It does not make a good, man-size cup of coffee with its one measure.

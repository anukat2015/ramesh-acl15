Title: Leaks from bottom
Content:
This coffee maker leaks from the bottom and leaves a messy counter. This is a replacement for a  previous one that did the same thing. Works fine for a few short months, so buyer beware.  Also the "pause and pour" quit working. Obviously the company has known about these problems from all the complaints that have been made over the years.

Title: What a great camera!
Content:
I have been dabbling in photography and astrophotography for a couple years now, and was looking for a good upgrade to my Coolpix 995.  Boy, was I blown away by this camera!  The XT is olidly constructed, has loads of manual features, and works well in the basic zones as well.  I would have liked to have seen it bundled with a better lens, but that's just nitpicking -- the lens is a solid performer for its $100 street price.  I highly, highly recommend this camera!!!

Title: Watery Defect....
Content:
I am now on my 2nd B70 at home and I have a 3rd at my office. For those who have posted that the coffee tastes watery and bland your unit is defective. The 1st one I brought home made watery coffee that tasted like bad airline coffee. We called Keurig and they said return it for an exchange. I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation. The one at my office works fine. 
Obviously there is a defect that causes the unit to make watery coffee. So if your unit isn't making delicious coffee and tea the unit is bad. Doesn't say much for the build quality on this model.

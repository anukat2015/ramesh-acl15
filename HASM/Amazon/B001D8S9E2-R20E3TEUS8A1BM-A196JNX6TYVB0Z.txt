Title: amazing laptop
Content:
I've wanted to buy a new laptop for a while now but was completely disgusted with vista and didn't really know what to do. When the new macbooks came out, I thought, well, it runs windows and linux as well as os x, so even if I don't like os x, I can still run xp on a new laptop. 
To put it very simply, this is a very good laptop. I couldn't believe the size of it, it's by far the thinnest laptop I have ever owned. The aluminum body is so sexy people actually stop by at my office to stare at it. I gave a presentation using iwork (amazing software by the way) the other day and there were more questions about my laptop than about my presentation.
The only problem I have had is with the trackpad. It seems to freeze every now and then and tapping to click/scroll doesn't really work well for me. I had to disable tapping and the apple update didn't really fix this problem for me.
But besides that, great screen, built in video camera and great software. os x is so nice. using spotlight for one thing is one of the highlights of my day. It takes a while to get used to os x but no problem, if you use google you can find out anything. All in all, a very good laptop, the trackpad is the only minus for me.

Title: A 1,000 times better than ANY Ipod
Content:
Don't listen to the Apple fan boys who rate this product one star.  I have personally owned every iteration of the Ipod and EVERY single one of them was crap.  They all crashed non stop and were constantly trying to erase my music library.  I own the flash drive version (this one) and my son owns the hard drive version and we have had NO FAILURE.  Is the Zune software the prettiest thing Microsoft has ever created?  Far from it.  But as far as aesthetics goes, Itunes is the worst looking software I have ever seen.  The latest version of the Zune software is much better.  Creating playlists is a snap and moving music to and FROM the Zune is much easier than the Ipod.  Hands down, the Zune is a much better music and video player.  The icing on the cake?  The Amazon MP3 store.  Unprotected music, baby.  16gb flash Zune and Amazon MP3 store.  I'm in heaven...

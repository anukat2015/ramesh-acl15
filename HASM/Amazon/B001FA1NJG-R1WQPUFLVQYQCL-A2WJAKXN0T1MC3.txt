Title: Zune 120 GB (Outstanding)
Content:
I have owned an Ipod for approx. 1 year, but it didn't have enough memory so I ordered a Zune 120 GB. One of the main reasons I chose the Zune over Ipod is because I am currently in Iraq and do not have access to Itunes. I never thought anything would compare to Ipod, but I was sadly mistaken. The Zune is very easy to load music/movies to and it is very user friendly and easy to navigate to get to the music/movie you want. It also has FM radio capabilities built in, where the Ipod requires you to buy a a converter.  I would highly recommend the Zune, even though I've only had it a week.  Even something should happen to it, I would definitely purchase another one just like it.

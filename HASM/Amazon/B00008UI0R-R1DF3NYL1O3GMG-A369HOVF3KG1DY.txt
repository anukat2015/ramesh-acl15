Title: Va-va-va-voom!
Content:
I was so excited when my research revealed *this* would be the perfect vacuum for our new house, which has hardwood floors throughout and only half a floor of carpet in the basement. The reviews were great and the price, at the time, was unbeatable, so I ordered in a hurry.
I put the vacuum together and plugged it in, and wouldn't you know it? The brush on the carpet/floor attachment wouldn't rotate. I called Amazon, sent it back at their expense and had a new one in two days. That's what I call customer service.
The new one works like a charm and, from the little bit of experimenting I've done so far, seems like a great product. I haven't had to clean the filter or the bagless container yet, but it doesn't seem like rinsing them under cold water--the recommended cleaning mode--will be too strenuous.
The vacuum is super high powered on low-nap carpet, so hold on to that wand! On hardwood floors, it picks up everything.
Enjoy!

Title: I LOVE IT!!!!
Content:
WOW!!! This product does exactly what it says... It keeps you cool!!! I moved to Southern California, and it is HHOOTTT. I am a student, so I couldn't really afford an Air Conditioner AND the bill. Summer came and before I bought this product, I was not sleeping at night and was grumpy all day. Now I can even sleep under my covers!! I spent $25 less than expected and It arrived 3 days after ordering!! I was so excited when I first got it that I forgot to put it on sleep and caught a cold...But who cares it was worth it. I LOVE IT!!!!

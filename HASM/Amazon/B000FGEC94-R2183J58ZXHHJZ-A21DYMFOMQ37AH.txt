Title: Wonderful Player
Content:
The iRiver is a fabulous little device.  When I purchased the unit, the iPod Nano's were both expensive and they lacked video.  I wanted both a video player and an mp3 player for commuting and vacation purposes. This device fits the bill perfectly.
First, it's incredibly portable.  If you buy the velcro strap/cover accessory you'll hardly notice the weight.  It's smaller than a deck of cards and is very light.  Second, the video is surprisingly good.  Watching a full length movie is no problem whatsoever.  Third, the storage capacity wasn't an issue for me.  Converting a full length movie to an iRiver compatible format reduces the size from ~5GB all the way down to ~400mb.  You can easily store two full-length feature films with room left over for hundreds (if not thousands) of songs.  That works for me.
I won't spend a lot of time on the D-click user interface except to say that I liked it.  It's not as cool as an iPod, but the space savings make the player considerably smaller than a Nano, which is nice.
The only downside I see to this player isn't even really the iRiver's fault.  Apple has their act together with the iTunes store and their Windows-based competition lags behind.  Sometimes way behind.
If you value portability, want video, and like FM radio then the iRiver is a huge bargain.

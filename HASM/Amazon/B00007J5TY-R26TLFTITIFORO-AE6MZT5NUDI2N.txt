Title: Good quality attachment for my Bosch vacuum
Content:
I bought this attachment for my Bosch 2100UC vacuum and it works very nicely on my hardwood floors.  It's well made but not too expensive.  The only drawback I can see is that has little wheels on the sides that engage the floor when downward pressure is applied.  That's probably to keep the attachment from being pushed so low on its bristles that it pushes dirt in front of it, and in fact I can say that the wheels do not affect the suction.  However, I am used to hard floor attachments that I can "float" along the floor without feeling any hard contact points.

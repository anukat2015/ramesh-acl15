Title: Excellent product
Content:
Great looks, great sound, great software. It can take any video file you try to put it, even if you have to convert it with the included software, unlike the other big named mp3/video player.
I have seen the ipod video and was shocked when i saw the menus. No images, no color, no nothing, just simple text with the options. Zen Vision:M at that aspect is 10000x better looking with it's wallpapers, decorated menus etc (for those that say the ipod is much better looking than the Zen). I'm very glad i bought this one, unfortunately it was only available in black, which is where it comes it's biggest problem. The Scratches!! i can say i couldn't be more careful with it, and yet its all scretched up. No big deal if you're looking at it turned on, because you can't notice them with all the beautiful colors of the screen. it's when it's off that you can see it. The other negative point (and i really can only find 2) is that against the sun, you can't see the screen very well. maybe i should tinger with the brightness level, since it's at 50% as it came from factory.
Overall it's one hell of a good player (music/photos/video). Every friend that i showed it to, was amazed with the quality of the screen and the movies.

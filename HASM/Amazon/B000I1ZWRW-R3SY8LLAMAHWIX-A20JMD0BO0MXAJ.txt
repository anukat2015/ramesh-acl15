Title: The Rebel in me .....
Content:
I recently purchased a Canon Rebel Xti, EOS 10.1 MP SLR. It was an upgrade for me from a Minolta 35mm and a digital Nikon Coolpix. I found that I could not get the shots I wanted with the point and shoot cameras¡K the shutter speed was too slow and the aperture too narrow. By the time the shutter closed, my children were long gone from the image and so I got lots of blur. My point and shoots NEVER survived in low light¡Kneedless to say I have fallen in love with my ¡§Rebel¡¨ and according to my husband,  spend way too much time with ¡§her¡¨ º
In my search for a good SLR that matched my budget, I chose the Canon Rebel Xti. I also chose Rebel based on other customer reviews. I researched the camera to make sure it was the ¡§right¡¨ one for me. My neighbor has an XT and she loved it. I got to see the feel of it and how it worked. 
The Rebel comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens, which is great for almost all photos. The clarity on this lens however is not ¡§top notch¡¨ and neither is the sharpness.  The downside to moving to the SLR is that it is ¡§in the way¡¨ around my neck¡Khits the kids in the face when I bend down and not as easy to ¡§lug¡¨ around. Otherwise, I did not find it cumbersome to travel with. The cumbersome item was the tripod I carried in my hands. It is worth it though considering the HUGE difference in capability.

My photographic mentor encouraged me to purchase a 50mm f1.8, as I enjoy doing portraiture, flowers, and photos in the sanctuary at church. I have had the 55 mm for about 2 weeks and shot about 700 photos with it. I paid  $75.00 for it. It is made by Canon. I really like this lens because the lens produces a nice bokeh on wide aperture shots. The lens is very fast and snaps that shot before the subject has a chance to move. I took some great photos of some geese in the UK and at f.8 1/100  I captured the movement of the birds¡¦ wings and froze them in time. I have 3 words for this lens, sharp, fast and crisp.
There are some downsides to the 50mm¡Kyour legs are the zoom. When you look through the viewfinder your subject is right in your face. Sometimes I struggle fitting everything into the viewfinder. I find this lens most appropriate for close ups and low light shooting¡K I have used it for landscapes, etc., but it is not my lens of preference for that¡K. I like the zoom lens for those shots.

Title: Had to return it since Creative Centrale almost ruined my marriage
Content:
Well, I bought the 16MB X-FI rather than any other player due to the following:
1. I have a Napster subscription and needed a compatible player (So no iPod, Zune, Cowon...)
2. I don't trust touch screen (So no Samsung P2, P3...)
3. I thought the music streaming from my desktop is neat, and would save me the need to upload 20GB of music to the player (so no Sansa View)
After seven solid days of trying to get the streaming to work properly, which almost cost me my marriage (I had to listen to "you love that mp3 player more than your daughter"...) I conclude it is simply a cruel joke. I tried it on three computers, desktop and two laptops, both Vista and XP, with two different networks. The streaming would start, and then stop; buffering would take forever; all my media would suddenly disappear and I would have to reinstall the program; my licenses to play Napster got messed up; it was a week of hell.
I returned it to Amazon, took my wife to a romantic date, and am considering a 32GB Sansa now.
I am giving it an extra star since it is a sexy little thing and if you don't have a lot of music, and don't use streaming, you will probably not hate it.

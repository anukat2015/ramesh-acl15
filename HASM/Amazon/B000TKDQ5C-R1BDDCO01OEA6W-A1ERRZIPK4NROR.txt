Title: Bought Two - Both Broke!
Content:
We initially bought one of these and it worked fine.  Then a month later bought a second one for another room.  That second one never worked properly and would flip the braker any time it was used, so we returned that one.  Then about a month after that, the knob broke off of the first one, rendering it useless too!  Not too pleased with the quality of this product!

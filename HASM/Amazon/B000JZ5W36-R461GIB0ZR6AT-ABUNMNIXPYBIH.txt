Title: YUCK!
Content:
I'll just quote my husband... "it tastes a little like tea..." I brewed a ton of pots trying to get a good cup and everytime it was the weakest coffee I've ever had. No matter how much coffee I put in. The grinder is strangely loud to the point that I have to walk away from it because it hurts my ears. A complete pain to clean, long story short, I am boxing it back up and returning it today.

Title: if you don't want video or your whole music library with you.....
Content:
I've had this little mp3 player for over a year now, bought one for my wife, and my brother loved it (bought one too). It's about the size of a lighter, light weight, and comes with a clip that actually works well. You got to spend a little bit of time to figure out the controls, especially if you're just trying to figure it out on your own, you might not notice the shuffle control. A tiny little button on the back side of the player. 
Battery time is awesome, there's just nothing else to that.
The moisture thing is true... I just started to notice it about a month ago. A small part of the screen is starting to have a little cloudy spot on it.  But after over a year of using it on my runs and workouts, and all of my travels, I cannot complain. 
I had bought a zune which was huge, then an ipod (not as big, but still bothered me on my runs). Then I realized that I don't need my whole music library with me at all times, so one gig is perfect for me.  If you purchase a good set of headsets... this player will deliver a good sound, great battery time, and plenty of music (you can use the atrac formatting from sony).

Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I just purchased this vacuum a couple weeks ago.  I had an old hand me down vacuum that I had since college that was no longer cleaning anything, so this was my first vacuum purchase.  I originally wanted a Dyson because I have used my mom's and I have heard such rave reviews but couldn't justify spending $500 on a f'n vacuum so I picked this up at Target for about $170.  It has been a great vacuum and I am very happy with my purchase.  We got it because it said it takes care of pet hair, and with three dogs and a cat we have a lot of pet hair.  This thing works like a charm and pulled tons and tons of hair out of our carpets.  What really amazed me was the amount of dirt it also picked up.  I read some reviews that say it lacks suction and clogs, but after 2 weeks and a blanket's worth of pet hair being sucked through it, I have yet to experience this.  The filters are nice in that they can be cleaned, except for the "post motor" filter which would need to be replaced but I can't imagine it would need replaced that often.  The lift off feature has been great for cleaning steps and ceilings, and the thing is lightweight enough to just carry around with you as you clean (unless you're a wuss).  The only downside I can think of is that the dust bin is kind of small but I am still able to clean the whole main floor of my average sized house before I have to empty it.  Overall, this is definitely worth the money and I really can't imagine a Dyson is worth the extra $320.
PROS:
* Cleans thoroughly, seems to get lots of deep down dirt
* Great for pet hair
* Lightweight
* "Lift off" feature is awesome
* Cleanable filters
* Reasonably priced
CONS:
* Small dust bin
UPDATE:  After about 5 months of owning this vacuum, I still stand by this review.  It has not clogged or failed in any way, still cleans the carpets brilliantly, and is and awesome vacuum.  The only thing I might add is to my "Cons" list is that the filters and the spinning brush need cleaned weekly if you are using the vacuum multiple times per week, but cleaning both filters and the brush takes approximately 15 minutes total.  This is an awesome vacuum.

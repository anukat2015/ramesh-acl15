Title: Just got this camera - It's Great!
Content:
I just unboxed this camera a few hours ago.  I've just gotten into SLR Photography, upgrading from a Canon Digital Elph point-and-shoot.  Let me just say: if you are an upgrader, you can't go wrong with getting the Canon EOS 40D.
First Impressions:
-The Screen Size is AWESOME.  It's really big.  The only issue is that, when using the viewfinder, my face was hitting the screen.  I decided to place a screen protector I had on it.
-Focusing is fast and accurate - I tested this in a relatively low light situation.  I was very impressed in random shots and complicated shots where the focus wasn't evident the steps the camera took to pick an appropriate autofocus.
-Flash is powerful
-The lens included in this kit is wonderful for the many of the reasons listed above - Fast AF and IS (Image Stabilizing).
-The camera is very nice to hold.  I was considering the Canon Rebel Xti as well, and the EOS 40D is definitely much more comfortable to hold.  The bigger size, I think, is worth it.
-The viewfinder is nice, and gives you all the details you could want regarding your picture.
-The flash is powerful but won't 'overblow' - close flash shots of people's faces look good.
-I love the control scheme - much more intuitive than many of the point-and-shoots that I have used.  The dial wheel is an awesome way to go through your images, and the "joystick" allows you to explore zoomed in images very intuitively.  
Overall, I feel I have made a great choice in investing in this camera as I learn more about photography.  Luckily, the camera is easy enough to use that one can use it as a very large point-and-shoot, giving me the freedom to take great shots while learning about the more complex details.

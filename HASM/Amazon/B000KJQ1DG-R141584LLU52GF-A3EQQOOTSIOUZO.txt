Title: Extremely Great Camera for The Price
Content:
I'm a beginner, this is my first DSLR and I'm extremely pleased. It is a little small for people with big hands like me. Honestly, a beginner photographer needs nothing more. The controls are easy to understand and are all laid out very well. Once you get a hang of it, it gets easier to take great pictures. And I've only had it for a few days! Be warned however that the RAW file Nikon cameras produce is called NEF and doesn't work very well with Adobe products. By "doesn't work well" I mean that any custom color settings that you set on the camera won't be recognized, such as 'vivid' mode. This isn't a problem as you can get the same effects in post-production if necessary, and if you plan on shooting JPEG this doesn't affect you. Nikon products will display properly however.
Pros: 
Great value for the price
Powerful and fast DSLR
Cons:
NEF issues mentioned above.
I would buy this again.

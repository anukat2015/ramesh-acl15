Title: Very impressed!
Content:
Our inexpensive Hoover just wasn't doing the trick against the pet hair from our three dogs.  We bought the Bissell Pet Hair Remover just before the holidays and are very happy with it.  The carpets have never looked cleaner in our home and the rubber upholstery attachment also worked great - much better than any brush attachment I've used.  This is a great vacuum for pet owners!

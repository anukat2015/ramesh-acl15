Title: Safe!  Works great around frenzied pets.
Content:
Aside from the plastiky smell it had for the first week or so, this heater is fantastic.
I followed the instructions, and turned it on full blast outside for two hours.  I recommend you double that time, because it still smelled.  
It went away though, with use.  
This smell of which I speak should not dissuade you from buying the heater, tho.  I put it on 1/4 power and turn off one side before I leave home for the day to keep my crated dog cozy.  When I come home the room is the perfect temp, not too hot.
It's very adjustable, and actually heats up the room rather quickly on full blast.

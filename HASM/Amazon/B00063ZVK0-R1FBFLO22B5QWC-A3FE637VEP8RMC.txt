Title: Still Undecided - but probably fine
Content:
I live in Dallas and it got down to the high 30's overnight, and is in the high 40's now.  We have this heater in a converted attic (15 X 33 foot a-frame style room) over our garage.  Temp showed to be 42 degrees in that room this morning when I turned it on.  3 hours later the temp is 62 degrees in the room and climbing (unit is set at 72).  It is a pretty big space and the unit is trying to heat it, but is struggling - I don't think we have any real insulation under the floor so that contributes to the struggle.  The other night we started with a temp of 57 and it got it to a reasonable temp in about an hour or so. In short, I think this unit will eventually get there which is actually somewhat amazing given the size of the space, but might need to be supplemented with another small heater. As an aside, the temp (as advertised) is very even throughout the room - no real hot/cold spots.

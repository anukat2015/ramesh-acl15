Title: First DSLR
Content:
I have been shooting pictures for over 30 years. I started with the K1000 and have been loyal to pentax ever since. I have used other top brands and feel that they are good, but always find pentax quality and price to be unsupased. From my medium format to 35mm the k200d is the camera I have been waiting for. It is a weather tight rugged work horse at an unbelievable price.I puchased the body only for it is compatable with virtualy all my other equipment.
I find the k200d is not as fast to focus as its film counterparts.Time between shots slightly slower, but the picture quality is sharp, color is spot on,and the unit is a breeze to operate with all the same familiar settings I am used to. I am glad that I have waited. This camera has welcomed me to the DSLR era with every thing I need. It has easily became the first tool I reach for because I know it will get the job done. I would highly recomend this camera to anyone. It takes awsome portraits both inside and out.

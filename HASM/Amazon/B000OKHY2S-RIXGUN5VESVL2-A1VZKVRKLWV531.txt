Title: Not worth your money and time...
Content:
Since I live in South Florida and I read a review from a person living in Florida, I thought that this product could cool my 15' by 12' room. All this product really is a glorified humidifier. I put ice, and even dry ice with water and it made absolutely no difference whatsoever. I think that this is a nice try by the swamp cooler companies to cool your room by at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit, but it really is a waste of money.
It may work in low humidity, but whoever writes the review from the Florida area or any area with high humidity, then it really is a waste of your money. Buy a portable ac instead.

Title: Nice player.
Content:
I had a Sansa e280 for little over a year. Unfortunately, it broke a couple days ago. I was very satisfied with it, but now i'm thinking about upgrading to a higher memory. The only cons are that it freezes fairly often- many times i had to wait until the battery died to use it. Also, after you put your music on the player, you can't edit the title, artist, album, or anything like that.
I would recomend this item over a nano.

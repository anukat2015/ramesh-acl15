Title: I want'a use it, too...
Content:
A Pro, I've a Canon Ds and a Canon D Mark II n, for jobs.  And, a Rebel XT and XTi, as back up cameras and for assistants to use, and I got an XSI for the same reason as the other Rebel's!   Though, I got to tell you, I really like this sweet little light 12MP camera.  Add the battery pack grip..., and I want'a use it too and am going to, especially when I want to lighten my camera bag for a long hike by foot to a location to shot and for times when I'll be carrying a camera in hand all day long...  It has all the basic manual and auto functions that I might need and then some, and other pluses...

Title: Good coffee but SLOW
Content:
I agree with all the positives mentioned by other reviewers. My only complaint is that it takes a while to brew 12 cups. It takes me 10-15 mins to brew the whole pot. I realize I can use the programming feature, but I want a coffee maker that brews fast. I have cleaned the machine, so it's not clogged, etc. I think I will try the Bunn coffee makers, they boast 3 mins for a full pot. That sounds better. If you have time to wait, it's a great coffee maker, if you want your coffee right away, I would stay clear of this machine.

Title: Good and Weak Points
Content:
I bought this because it was one of the few one person coffee makers and it received good reviews. But there are issues that make me want to move on.
Messy: No pause n pour. It will drip for a long time after brewing and will drip all over the place when you pick up the mug.
Mug Not Insulated: While it may do better than a porcelain mug it still gets very warm on the outside. I pour from the mug into a different insulated cup.
Easy to choke: No matter the grind or the coffee quantity it will chokes and grounds will stick to the water disperser. This along with the dripping makes it kind of messy. However I do not use the included mesh filter but use #2 filters for convenience.
I can't give it below average because it is cheap and makes reasonably good coffee. I have used it for a number of months but am considering other options for less mess.

Title: Waste of Money!
Content:
Used our Honeywell HZ-341BL heater very sparingly (we live in Orlando, FL) for one season and it worked fine.  This season when I tried to turn on the heater, nothing happened.  Looked in the manual to troubleshoot the problem and the manual provided zero guidance.  Searched for similar issues on-line and discovered this type failure to be a common anomaly with this product.  One solution suggested that the problem was caused by a stuck sensor switch and recommeded inverting and rattling the heater to unstick the sensor.  For me, this method did not work.  What will work for me is to not buy another Honeywell product.  Consumer beware!

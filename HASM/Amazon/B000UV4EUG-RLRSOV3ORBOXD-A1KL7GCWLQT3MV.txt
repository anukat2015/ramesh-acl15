Title: A few annoyances
Content:
I have now had the Creative Zen for about a month.  
What I like about the Zen:
(1)its looks (very stylish and "with the times")
(2)the screen (clear!)
(3)the sound (crisp)
(4)the size (perfect). 
(5)the alarm (it turns the player on automatically at your set time) .. but no snooze.
(6)the ability to drap & drop
However, there are two annoyances that I have found with it that make me give it only 3 stars -- an "average" rating.  
(1) it does not have resume play.  So when the Zen turns off, so does the place you were at in your music.  ESPECIALLY if you are in shuffle.  It turns back on a completely different song, in a random place.  I don't like this, because when I'm in my car, when I leave and come back, I want to continue listening to what was just on, more like a CD.
(2) it tends to freeze A LOT when importing music and syncing.  I have had to push the restart button at least 50% of the time I am loading new content.  It doesn't get rid of anything when it has to be restarted, but it's a pain to have it constantly freeze and then have to restart it.
Because of these two issues, I am not sure if I would recommend the Zen to anyone.  
**************************>>>>>>>>>>update 6/24/09:
I have now had the Zen for a year and a half.  I still don't really like it.  Here are the additional pluses and minuses (none of my original pros and cons have changed)
pro:
(1) you can change the wallpaper to whatever you want -- nice customization
(2) good size - have never had any problems carrying it or pushing the buttons
(3) has a real radio -- not streaming.
cons:
(1) VERY difficult to import music on to it.  It will put everything on there whether it's already on there or not...so I end up with TONS of duplicates. I have solved this by backing it up, completely erasing it, then going through my music list and re-syncing EVERYTHING back on to it.  It's a real pain.
(2) The software it comes with to sync sucks.  And I have found no software that will allow you to update files while ON the player.  Again, I end up taking it all off and putting it ALL onto my computer, fixing the tracks or updating them, then reloading everything back on.  I have found only Media Monkey to work the best...but I still can't really do anything with the tracks that are actually on the player.
(3) Battery life is awful.  When you turn it off it really doesn't turn off for a while -- it's like hibernating, so it's sucking energy even when you're not using it
(4) When the battery is drained, it's impossible to charge it in the car.
(5) Also when the battery is drained, sometimes I have to reset it to get it to even charge.
(6)  If a track does not have an album, it will not play and don't show up on the song list.  So those songs you don't know what album they came from - -- you need to make up an album or you'll never find it on the Zen.
(7) The way it stores album art is weird.  I will have it all good on my computer, transfer it, then on the Zen it's something completely different.  I have yet to figure out why it does that.  But in order to change the album art, you have to do it when the song is on the computer, as - again - I have yet to find a program that will let you do it while the song is on the Zen.

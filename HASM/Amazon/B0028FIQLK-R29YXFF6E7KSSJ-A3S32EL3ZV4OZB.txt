Title: Like a pickup truck on turbo...big, ugly, and fast.
Content:
I had an ASUS G1S before this.  That machine fried itself with it's 8600GT-M video card (if you have this watch out for your ticking timebomb).
Anyway, got this as a refurb from Asus when I sent in my G1S.
The G50VT is about an inch or 2 wider in the case.  It doesn't fit in my laptop bag now.  It's got this really hideous graphic on the cover.  I mean, something from Ed Hardy ugly.  This is why it's staying home.
It came with 4gb ram/320gb hd (5400rpm boohoo), Vista Home Premium 64bit.  It's a quick machine.  Takes a while to get out of sleep mode, but that'll be rectified (I hope) with a fresh copy of Win7.  Screen resolution is blech.  The G1S had 1680x1050.  I was in love.  Now I'm back to 1366x768 (oh my god..my icons are big enough for grandma to read without glasses).  Oh and no Bluetooth.  Had trouble connecting to my Linksys WiFi router.  Didn't like WEP.  I had to use WPA (the preferred way), but now I have to reconfigure everything else in my house..ugh.
Get it, like it, and don't take it out of the house for fear of ridicule from anyone over 15 years old.

Title: DeLonghi HHP800 Space Heater
Content:
I bought a DeLonghi HHP 1500 space heater last winter and was pleased with the purchase.  However, the DeLonghi HHP800 space heater I purchased this year is considerably smaller and provides far less heat than that purchased last year for seemingly the same price.  Too, I like the look of the black model more so than the new white one.  Recommend one stick w/ the HHP1500 to get more bang for their buck (though I don't actually know what that one is selling for these days).  This was an instance where I would have been better off buying at a "brick & mortar" store.  There I would have recognized the difference as opposed to doing insufficient research and pulling the trigger on-line.

Title: Works Great The best
Content:
This is the best coffemaker we have owned. Coffee tastes better..no pot to clean. I find filling the water reservoir to be no more difficult than other conventional coffee makers. No leaking issues either.
   Was a little hesitant to purchase due to some of the negative comments posted here but I have no complaints. No matter how good a product is someone will always be unhappy with it. Steve P

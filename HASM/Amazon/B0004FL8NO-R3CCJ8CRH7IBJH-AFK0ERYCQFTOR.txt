Title: Great coffeemaker
Content:
I had an old Black & Decker coffeemaker with a plastic carafe that worked very well, and bought this one when I dropped the carafe and chipped the top.  This new one is even better and quicker to use.  The cone shaped filter basket seems to need less coffee to make the same strength, and is easier to insert, remove and clean.  The water tank conveniently lifts right out with easy to read marks to fill at the sink; no need for filling a separate jug and pouring in.  And easy to use programmer for morning coffee.

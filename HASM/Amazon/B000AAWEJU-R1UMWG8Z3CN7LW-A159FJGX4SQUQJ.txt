Title: Like magic.
Content:
Ordered on a Tuesday and like magic, it was here the next day, not even 48 hours later!
I decided on this vacume after reading other reviews on Amazon and I am very glad I did.  My other upright was perfectly good and had great suction but since my back surgery, I had a hard time pushing it around and it didn't get into any of the hard to get to places.  It also had a beater bar and when cleaning hard floors, everything went flying.
This little vacume can lift my rugs from the floor if I want it to and is very light weight.  It is not the full size canister type but sure acts like one.  Love it!

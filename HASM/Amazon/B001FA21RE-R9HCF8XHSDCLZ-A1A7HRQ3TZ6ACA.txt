Title: Dolce Gusto - great taste, really convenient!
Content:
Just moved from Europe and missing our Dolce Gusto machine badly - until last Friday!  US model is improved in design and still delivers the great taste we love.   Black coffee with authentic 'crema' or latte macchiato for a smoother drink.
The machine has a larger reservoir than the earlier version, uses less energy to make a cup of coffee than any other solution we have seen, can deliver multiple cups in quick succession and, if we forget to switch it off, it powers itself down after 20 minutes.
Just great!  Grazie mille Nestlé!!

Title: Be Aware of Autofocus Limitation
Content:
First let me say, this camera is exceptional in the quality of image, feature-set, etc. I am writing this review only to warn others who are not aware: the autofocus feature in the D40 and D40x is different than all the other Nikon models. 
We purchased the Tamron AF 18-200mm 3.5-5.6, fully expecting the autofocus to work as witnessed/experienced on my friend's D70. Not so. My bad for not uncovering this little-written-about fact. (I would think, after having read hundreds of reviews, this would have been revealed). I knew the D40 & D40x required a Nikkor DX lens, but third party lenses don't have this specific identifier, and assumed "Autofocus Lens for Nikon" would meet that requirement on the D40(x) as well. 
Therefore, I am entering this tidbit for the record. Camera is a 5, (when coupled with the somewhat limited quantities of, and somewhat more expensive, lenses with autofocus built into the lens). Coming from the point-and-shoot world, I absolutely love this camera!
Also for the record, I am sending the D40x back, (Thanks Amazon, your return policy and service is outstanding.)and upgrading to the D80 instead which works with all autofocus lenses, and besides, whats a couple hundred extra bucks when your buying this quality of camera.  Can't wait to get the shipment, I fell in love with this camera the moment I started shooting.

Title: Defect Model, Amazon still sell
Content:
I bought D5000 from Amazon after Nikon announced the D5000 recall. When I received the camera and check with Nikon website, the camera matched the defect serical number. Therefore, I had to ship it to Nikon for repair the same day. Hope I get it back in one week. Then my D5000 will be a repaired model or refurbished model before I used it.
 
Two comments,
1. If I bought it from local store, I can return it right away and buy D90 instead. Sad things for online shopping.
2. If Amazon is really a responsible vendor, it should check the serial number and don't ship the defect models.
3. If Nikon is a responsible vendor, it should ask resellers to stop seling defect models and send them for repair first. Shame on Nikon!

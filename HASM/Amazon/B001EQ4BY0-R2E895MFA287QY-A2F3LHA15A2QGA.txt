Title: Great Camera
Content:
| am an advanced amateur with a good experience with Canon equipments ( 40D,5D plus 5 L lens) and 15 years shooting mainly landscape and wildlife.
After a Safari to Africa, I realized I needed two things
 - Higher ISO capacity to get better shots on the dark. Even with my 70-200 2.8 IS I missed some great shoots because ISO 3200 was not high enough
 - More resolution to crop bird pictures that my 40D with a 100-400L could not fill the whole frame
So the 50D seemed like the perfect upgrade to my next photo safari to Tanzania. It have all the specs I wanted plus some cool features such as the VGA view.
After three days using the camera I am glad I bought it. I can not compare this camera to the Nikon, since all my gear are Canon, but compared to the 40D and the 5D the performance of this camera is great ( it have more noise than the 5D but it is much more user friendly and 6.3 pictures per s is perfect for wildlife). 
Highly recommended!

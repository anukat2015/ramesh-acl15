Title: good and bad
Content:
After my Toshiba Satelite being stolen a couple of years ago, I have waited quite some time to be able to afford a new one.  When I go to purchase, I look for something that can carry me through the next 5 years and something I believe will stand up to the test of time.
So I went with this Toshiba Qosmio X505-Q830 and that was a mistake so far.  I love the computer when it won't freeze up.  That has been an issue from the beginning.
It's performance is great, love many things about it except it's weight, locking up, the number of programs that come pre-loaded and also the fact that it comes with no software or restore disc but you have to create your own or order one at 24.99 which I had to.  I had to eventually send it in for repair after a little over a month and they have had to order new graphics card, hard drive, and mother board to try and find the problem.  The only problem with that is the fact the parts are on back order and so now I am without laptop for almost a MONTH! 
Well, needless to say, I wouldn't repeat the buy but if it comes back and doesn't have any issues, I would give an overall rating of 4 considering all things about this computer.
I love Toshiba but I have just had a bad experience with this laptop.  Also, it likes to over-heat when I am not really gaming but just using quite a bit with software and programs so I had to raise the base up by applying some strips of rubber to create more air flow.

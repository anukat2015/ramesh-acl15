Title: Great Camera!
Content:
I love this camera, I am a huge Canon fan though, so I am very biased.  I do photography as a hobby and for friends who need portraits or events done and this camera is perfect for those small events where a heavy camera would be too much.
For better options do add a remote and a few other lenses so that you can expand your ability and function.

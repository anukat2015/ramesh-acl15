Title: Soleus - and a warm soul at that
Content:
We purchased this product just when the weather in VA was starting to get a bit brisk (right before our biggest snow storm in history).  The heater does its job - heats our family room quite well.  Even though we have a heat registers in our family room - there are areas that are often cold.  This product helps keep the family room warm - we spend alot of time in that room. I like that it has a timer, temperature control, high, medium and low settings, and a VERY EASY TO USE remote control.  
We love it!

Title: Love Honeywell heaters!
Content:
Just wanted to take a moment & Say that we have owned this heater for about 4 years now.. Well not this exact one because we have replaced ours every few years. 
But the reason I am writing this is because they one we received from this purchase does NOT have the option to switch it to front only... Which is one HUGE plus for us. I am not sure why the ad says it includes it... or why ours didnt.. But it stinks. 
We are about to order another one because our "old faithful" is dying... (we keep 2 in the house at all times lol) & if it doesnt have that switch I WILL be contacting Amazon! 
But it is a great heater none the less & I highly recommend it! Tons of Safety features & lots of warm heat :-)

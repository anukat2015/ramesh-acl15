Title: Nice Addition to the Kitchen
Content:
I must have been lucky, because I purchased one recently and I only paid $120 for it and it included 2 boxes of coffee pods (24 pods in each box).  I like the look and the ease of using this item.  I order my supplies from Green Mountain Coffee.  They have a huge variety of coffee, tea and hot chocolate.  I like that the coffee maker has 3 cup size settings, but there still could be another one that is larger.  My hubby likes to use a HUGE travel mug, so he ends up brewing 2 pods, one at the 9.25 setting and one at the 5.25 setting to fill his mug.  The middle size is perfect size for me when I brew tea.  The only problem we have with it, is that it makes a ton of noise when filling the water.  I have a corporate Keurig at work and that one makes no noise at all.  If it wasn't noisy I would give 5 stars.

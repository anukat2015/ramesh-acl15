Title: Won't generate enough heat
Content:
I bought this Bionaire BH3950 and after a week of use, I have decided to return it.  Consider other heater I have seen, this heater is a nice looking heater.  Now, here is the bad part....It's simply a horrible heater.  There simply is very limited heat coming out  of this heater.  The only way I can even feel the heat is if my butt is actually touching the damn thing.  Secondly, this heater does not have any fan so it's not going be be blowing the warm air anywhere. 
This heater is very easy to assemble...Pretty much just snap everything together.  Comes with 2 wheels, a bottom holder, and the top handle (by the way, once the top handle is snap on, it can't be taken out again.  So don't snap that thing on unless you are sure you are going to keep it). 
My last attempt was this morning.  I set it about 3 feet away from me and can not feel a single damn heat.  It was turned on pretty high too.  After 3 hours of not feeling any heat 3 feet away, I went back to the store and got my refund.  
Looks/Design: 8/10
Quietness:  10/10
Heating: 1/10
Durability: unknown
Assemble: 10/10.
Overall, it is a sleek, nicely design looking heater.  Unfortunately, it failed at what it is suppose to do....Heat my room.

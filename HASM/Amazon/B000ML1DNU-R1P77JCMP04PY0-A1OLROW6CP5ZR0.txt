Title: Far from Magic ...
Content:
I have owned two of these vacuums over the past several years. To be honest I have never paid more than $90 on each of these Kenmore's, so the relatively low retail price may be an indicator that this vacuum is not the best. The first I had to toss because it lost all it's suction and there was a burning smell coming from it. The second one I bought, used occasionally and gave up on as it doesn't work well either. 
This Kenmore picks up the big stuff - pieces of paper towel on the floor, cat litter, etc. It does not pick up dirt in the carpet. It barely touches pet hair. Poor suction overall, you can vacuum an area and it will not have picked up everything and you can tell. The main attachment has never worked for me - I had to vacuum all types of floor with the carpet brush for it to "work". The bag seems to ** magically ** fill every few uses and the bags are expensive - I have paid about $15 on average for 8 bags, which with average household use would last me a total of 2-3 months. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone who wants a truly clean house - especially if you have allergies to dirt & dust which hide in your carpet, in which case I definitely think this vacuum will NOT do much for you.  There's nothing "magic" about how this thing cleans.

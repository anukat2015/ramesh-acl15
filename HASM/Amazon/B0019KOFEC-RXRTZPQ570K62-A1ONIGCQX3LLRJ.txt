Title: Not recommended
Content:
I was not impressed.  I thought I had done the proper research but found out that ordering this vacuum online was a costly mistake.  I have a light haired golden that shed's a lot, which is why I needed a vacuum that would perform well....this is NOT it.  I only have area rugs and it would not pull up any hair to make a visible difference.  Its super light weight, and a great idea, but if you are serious about getting rid of the pet hair, look elsewhere.  I bought another Eureka, I believe it was called a comfort clean, and although its a little bulker, its 1000% better at getting up the pet hair.

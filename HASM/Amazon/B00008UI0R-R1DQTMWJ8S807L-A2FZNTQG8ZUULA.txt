Title: Great Vacuum Cleaner - No more
Content:
Two years later - the vacuum has a short, and needs $139 repair. So I'm having the same problem as in the other negative reviews. So disappointing because I really liked this machine. Buyer beware! Here is my original review: "This is definitely the best vacuum cleaner I've ever owned, and at an excellent price. It has tremendous suction power, and I also appreciate the suction control feature. Plus, it's relatively easy to carry up and down stairs. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that all of the attachments don't fit on the tank."

Title: Nothing better...
Content:
this is the best camera I have owned.  Flat out awesome.  The advanced features are easy to get used to if you used film in the past.  The basic modes are awesome.  This is a pick it up and use it camera as well as a having advanced features to learn and take stunning photos, not just snapshots.
This camera captures it all vs the compact digital soul stealer cameras that take great snapshots.

Title: not heating enough area
Content:
this is a nice package and the heater is supposed to heat 1000 sq ft. i have 200 sq ft and it wont heat past 64 deg f. and keeps running. it is not a totally air tight room but even at 40 deg f. outside temp. this heater never turned off and i'm only on the 3rd heat position. not sure about efficiency. but it keeps running. puts out nice heat but will see when next electric bill comes in.

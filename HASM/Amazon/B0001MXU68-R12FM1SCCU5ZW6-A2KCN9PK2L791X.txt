Title: SHORT life span
Content:
I received the Melitta for my birthday last year & instantly fell in love.  I loved it for all of its unique features...  the freedom to each drink our own preferred flavor without wasting a whole pot of coffe, the quickness of the brew, the ease of use, the sleek design.  It was great for entertaining small groups and even better day to day (even a sleepy person can get their coffee without much thought)
I enjoyed the Melitta for 10 straight months before my world crashed down on me.  
The element blew.  They cannot fix it... and they cannot offer me a free replacement because the 12 month warrenty is only good if you have a receipt.  Unfortunately for me - this was a gift.  Customer service was quick to respond but unable to offer any consolation.
As much as I enjoyed the Melitta - a year to remember - I am having a hard time buying a new one.  For all of its strengths are not worth $49.99 each year!!!!
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

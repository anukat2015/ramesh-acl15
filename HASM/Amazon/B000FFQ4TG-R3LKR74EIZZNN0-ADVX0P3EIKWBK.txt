Title: The way coffee should taste!
Content:
Just bought this coffeemaker to replace our old one (a Black & Decker, I think?).  I had my first cup and it was amazing!  So much better than any other coffeemaker.  It is quick and easy, once you get past the initial set-up when you buy it.  To any of the other reviewers who gave this a bad review because it has to be plugged in all the time...well, yeah, you probably should have read about that in countless reviews before buying it.  I know I read several reviews of different coffeemakers before I made my purchase, so to give this coffeemaker a ONE star review because you didn't do the research is absolutely absurd!  To not even mention the taste of this coffee is ridiculous!  If you want the best tasting coffee with no bitter aftertaste, buy a BUNN, keep it plugged in, and enjoy!  If the idea of keeping it plugged in scares you, then do not buy!  It's that simple.

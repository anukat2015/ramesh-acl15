Title: Perfect replacement camera.
Content:
After having my original Rebel stolen, I replaced it with the Xsi.  The shutter speed is super fast, the viewing screen is huge so you know right away if you got the shot, and the quality of indoor pics is fantastic.  The battery charges quickly and lasts a long time.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase. No complaints - the only thing I miss about my old Rebel is the memory card that was still in it.

Title: Perfect
Content:
This camera is perfect.  Right out of the box it takes beautiful pictures.  Even if you are new to SLR cameras like I am, this camera is very easy to learn.  Going from point and shoot to this camera I was concerned I wouldn't like shooting through the view finder (although the camera has the live view function, you get better control of the camera by using the view finder as you get the auto focus points only through the view finder) but I have had the camera for 2 weeks and have used the live view maybe one time.  Shooting through the view finder isn't bad at all, but if you need to use the live view for positioning the camera above your head or near the ground, the live view works well for that.  Like I said I am still learning the camera but right out of the box you get GREAT photos with very little effort, the camera exceeds my expectations.

Title: I am so happy I bought it!!!
Content:
I just recieved my Zune on Tuesday and cannot put it down. I had no problems installing the software and I think it is the perfect size all around (personally I dont like tech that is almost as thin as paper). I didnt find it bulky at all in fact it fits perfectly in my hand (which is rather small). I have never previously owned an MP3 player, but I have toyed around with the ipod and did not like it (I thought it looked simple and I hate the clickwheel) however I do like Itunes... I get my tv shows from there:) Both products have their positive and negative points its just what works for you because they are almost the same.
I recommend this product to anyone.

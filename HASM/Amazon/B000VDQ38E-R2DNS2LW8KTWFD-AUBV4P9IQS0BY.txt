Title: Bulky
Content:
Got the vacuum and wish I could return it! It is awkward and bulky to use.......the hose keeps coming loose so you can be vacuuming without it really working. It does not turn or move well and unless you're cleaning wide-open spaces with nothing else in the room - forget it! Really wish I hadn't bought it!

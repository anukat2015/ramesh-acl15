Title: I never knew coffee could taste this good!!!
Content:
I was shopping for a new coffee maker for a gift, and ended up splurging after a salesperson convinced me to pay the extra money for a combination grind/brew machine. I can't believe how happy I am with this coffeemaker! This is the first grinder we have ever used, and the taste compared to store-bought ground coffee flavor is phenomenal. Everything about the coffeemaker makes me glad I bought it!

Title: Great Coffee and Conversation Piece
Content:
When I spotted this coffeepot that matched the color of my kitchen, I just had to have it.  My husband thought $100 for a coffeepot was a bit much, but grudingly admitted it looked great.  Then we found that it made great coffee AND was complimented by all who saw it, a true conversation piece.  I love it's clean lines, and we have had no problems in cleaning it or keeping it looking clean for well ove a year now.  If I repaint the kitchen, you can bet it will be in a color that will match another coffee pot like this!

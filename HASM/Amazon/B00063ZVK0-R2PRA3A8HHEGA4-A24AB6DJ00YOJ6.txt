Title: Good heater
Content:
Purchased this heater for use as a supplemental heat source in our family room.  Would mention a couple of things.  First, the noise level is very low, even when running in the high position.  Does not interfere with TV, music listening, etc.  From that stand point, its great.
From a heating standpoint, it is better any other heater I've used for supplemental heat.  Our family room is large with a lot of open areas.  This heater does bring room temperature up about 4 degrees in roughly 30 minutes.  If the temperature was at 65 degrees,  it reaches
68 to 69 degrees without a problem.  But that's the extent of what it can do.  Prior to buying this heater, I read several of the reviews here and had the impression it would do better (perhaps just my interpretation of the postings I read).  Anyway, it's not going to heat a large area 
to 72 degrees and keep it at that temperature by itself.  At least that has been my experience.  Having said that, I consider it a good heat source for its size, but don't expect the impossible.  Am I sorry I purchased it--No.  It is worth the money--Probably.  Does it fulfill my expectations--not quite.  But I wouldn't fault the heater, just my exceptions of what it can or cannot do.  Its much better than other heater I've tried.  Hope this helps...

Title: Space heater
Content:
DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp Technology
I just recently purchased this product for my daughter's room. Our insulation in the walls is not very good and their is a draft in her room. This space heater has been wonderful. The first 8-10 hours, I let it run with all windows open because it has a funny smell and some smoke in the beginning. The manufacturer tells you to expect this...so nothing to worry. I have LOVED IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT. Also, it is easy to wheel from room to room if necessary and is very compact and you can control the heat temperature via a dial.

Title: Beautiful laptop!
Content:
Can't complain, so far. The brown Vaio is just beautiful, not that looks matter! The keyboard is wide and comfortable to use. DVDs look great on the widescreen....but know that the screen is rather glossy, and don't set up the laptop with a window behind you. Speakers are decent. Still getting used to Windows 7, which seems user-friendly and is certainly easier on the eye than XP. Some nice features, like being able to grab photos easily and plunk them right into email. This model of the Vaio has been discontinued. Not sure which model replaces it.

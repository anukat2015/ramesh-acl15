Title: My First iPod
Content:
I am a 50-something techno-dinosaur but the 4thG iPod is SO easy to use, so compact, so light, so conveninet that even I can do it.  I've been able to download tunes with no problems...my only complaint is that everything is so small on the iPod that I need my glasses to see what I'm doing. :)

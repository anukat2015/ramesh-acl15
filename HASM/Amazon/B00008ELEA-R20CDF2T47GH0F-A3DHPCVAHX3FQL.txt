Title: Makes great coffee; broke in less than 5 years.
Content:
I'm kind of old-fashioned, and was really unhappy with lukewarm coffee coming out of drip.
I decided to go with Farberware because of the perceived quality of its products (in the earlier decades); I was really happy with it and it made great piping HOT coffee.
Unfortunately, with anything that has electric pieces, it didn't last long (less than 5 years); I knew this going in, but for the price that I paid, I would've expected it to last just a little bit longer! It and started making lukewarm coffee. 
FYI, I always took good care of it, washed it (without submersion) after every use, and even though it serves as a warmer after every brew, always unplugged it.
I'm not sure I would buy Farberware again. They used to be one of the brands to get more than twenty years ago, but haven't heard great things about them lately.

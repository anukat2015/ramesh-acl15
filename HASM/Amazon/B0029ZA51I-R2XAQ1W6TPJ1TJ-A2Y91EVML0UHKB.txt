Title: Guess I Got a Good One!
Content:
What a great laptop.  Read some of the horror stories, just hard to believe.  I've been building computers for family and friends since 1988 and for the money, can't beat the performance.  Good processor, sufficient HD, more than sufficient memory and for the money, can't beat the graphics and great sound.  Yes, just as in everything else, a lemon gets through, but you can't judge them all on a few.  I was looking at Acer's Timeline machines and with all of them you sacrifice performance for battery life.  Smaller processors use less power.  I'll take the 3 to 4 hours and performance anytime.  If you get a bad on return if for another, if the same happens, then you have a right to complain.  Life is to short to get stress out over trivial matters.

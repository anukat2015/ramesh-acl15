Title: Perfect Coffee Maker for the Lazy
Content:
My wife and I purchased this coffee maker as an anniversary gift to ourselves as we both like drinking coffee but hate making a whole pot, drinking one cup, and then cleaning it up. 
With this coffee maker we make one cup and clean up is a snap. We are trying all different kinds of coffee's and are making a list of what we love the most. 
If you like coffee but hate the mess and cleanup of the process then you need this coffee maker!

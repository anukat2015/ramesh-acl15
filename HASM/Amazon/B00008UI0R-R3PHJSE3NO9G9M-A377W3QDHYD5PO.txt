Title: ginormous
Content:
I hate this vacuum.  I bought this one after my Panasonic cannister model died (my baby needed 'white noise' to fall asleep to & after 3 months of running the vacuum nightly for 30-60min, the motor burned out).  This vacuum is so big & cumbersome that I dread using it (I'll even sweep or swiffer to avoid having to lug it out of the garage).  It's heavy, the cord is kind of short, so I can only vacuum 2 rooms until I have to change outlets.  It also tends to not pick up cat litter and small pieces of dirt/paper that are on the ground, so I usually have to swiffer afterwards anyway. I don't have an attachment that allows me to do stairs or upholstery, and the regular head is also heavy & cumbersome to lift & move around.  I really liked my Panasonic, but couldn't find it locally, so got this Hoover, but even though I've only had it a few months I'm looking for different models. Maybe the Panasonic again.

Title: Rebel Indeed
Content:
This camera deserves this description very well. It is a rebel in terms of its price-value ratio.  
Since nothing is perfect in this world, there's no point going on about what is missing in this camera. I found lots of things, including the 8.0 million pixel resolution, that made me happy from the very start. Picture write and read speed is fine, depending on the manufacturer of the card one uses. Focusing is done in a snap (and so far I haven't taken the camera outside from the dusk of my flat to see how it performs in better lighting). Even with the basic kit on, one can easily crop pictures taken at maximum resolution (RAW) to achieve a very good digital zoom (if you do not distinguish between the two types of zoom). Now, invest some money in people selling things for photographers:), and they'll let you have better lenses to take pictures from whatever distance your selected moose or stark naked woman on the beach feels comfortable with your presence.:)) 
The software that came with the camera, is easy to use. 
All functions are easy to learn and remember. If not, some reading of the manual and additional material concerning medium-level basics of photography will help settle this dispute between what the camera offers and what you have chosen to learn so far. I don't agree that the camera seems too small. Or is it that some of those complaining about this aspect would still prefer to use the first makes of cellular phones? I doubt that. Smaller buttons is an overall tendency for all types of electronic equipment nowadays. Learn to live and deal with this.   
No complaints whatsoever on my part.

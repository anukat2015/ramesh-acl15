Title: So far so good
Content:
We bought this Ipod Nano for my husband who seems quite happy with it.  We had thought that the video feature would be a waste but our son has totally taken to it so whenever he gets his hands on it, he's shooting videos!  Battery life seems quite poor compared to some of the other Ipods but haven't done any scientific test on that :-)  The only down side is that the whole thing looks so slippery that when you hold the nano in your hands you tend to be feel nervous about dropping it.

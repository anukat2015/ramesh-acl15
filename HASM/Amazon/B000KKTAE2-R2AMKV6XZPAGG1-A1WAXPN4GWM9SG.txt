Title: Optimus Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater
Content:
I really love radiant heaters and currently have 3 of them, I know the fans are necessary in order for the thermostats to work but hate the sound they make. Just the light sounds from a fan interfere with being able to hear the distant sounds outside the room. I know it is possible  to make a super quiet fan but it is simply not done on the radiant heaters I've purchased.   The little optimus only has 800 watts but the  quiet operation is leading me to buy 2 more for the bedrooms, even though we have a natural gas furnace.

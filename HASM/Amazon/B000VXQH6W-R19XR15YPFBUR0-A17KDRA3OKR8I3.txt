Title: lousy product
Content:
The device I received does not work per advertisement and/or user documents.  I tried to return the item and was rebuffed by the seller.  I tried to contact the manufacturer and found out that they are out of business.  As far as I am concerned buying a product via a 3rd party player on Amazon is not the best thing to do and will probably not attempt it again in the future.  Bottom line of this product - it is hanging in a plastic bag in my study - useless and a piece of crap.  
As far as the rating of the item I could only do that if there were negative stars to place in the section.

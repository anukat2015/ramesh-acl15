Title: Great Heater
Content:
Great heater. It met all our requirements (small, low cost, safe, remote, thermostat, tip-over protection). It's great for getting dressed on cold mornings, just turn it on and the area right in front is warm right away. It takes a little more time ~1/2 hr to warm up our whole bedroom, but that seems to be pretty good for such a small heater. It makes a little noise (of course), but nothing we can't sleep through and it actually seems quieter than another similar heater we bought for another room. And the remote is great for turning it on and off without having to get out of the warm bed.

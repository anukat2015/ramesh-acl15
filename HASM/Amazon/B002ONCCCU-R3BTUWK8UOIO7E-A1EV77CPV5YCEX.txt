Title: HP Review
Content:
This paticular laptop so far is working great except, I realize if I copy an image and set it as my wallpaper and "tile" the image then close or shut down the laptop and then restart the comp. what I originally had tiled as an image is now strechted but if I go to change it back to tile it doesnt allow me too. So i find that you cant tile pictures that you want to set as your background. Also the battery life is not 3 1/2hrs long i get 2 1/2hrs long before I have too plug in again. I also find if you point to an object to click on sometimes the cursor or mouse jumps around alot enabling you to connect to what you really want to click on. But i must say that doesn't happen too often.         
But otherwise than that Im enjoying my laptop. I purchased this in November 2009. Thanks.

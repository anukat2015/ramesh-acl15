Title: Poor workmanship
Content:
I bought this vacuum because of the legendary Electrolux name.  I really like the vacuum, but the workmanship is poor.  I have only owned it for 3 months and the power head broke off the wand of the vacuum.  It is only held together by plastic and I am waiting for the company to replace the power head now.  Again this is a nice vacuum but I want to see if the new power head will hold up to weekly use.

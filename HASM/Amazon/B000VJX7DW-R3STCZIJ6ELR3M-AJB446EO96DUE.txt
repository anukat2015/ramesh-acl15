Title: almost perfect, for now
Content:
The Nikon D300 was the camera that convinced me to complete my migration from Canon's EOS Digital system. My previous main body was a Canon EOS 20D. I liked that camera, but had become frustrated by its small rear display and lack of a sensor dust-removal system. I have a collection of manual focus Nikkor lenses from my film days, and I tested the Nikon waters a few years ago by purchasing a D40 to experiment with those lenses. Using the manual lenses on the D40 was less than satisfactory (no metering), but I did find myself turning to the D40 regularly over the following months. I preferred its treatment of highlights and noise to that of the Canon - the Nikon approach to image processing undoubtedly results in a more "film-like" result.
Anyway, back to the D300 - The display is gorgeous - HUGE compared to the Canon 20D. The image processing is superb: low noise until ISO 1600, but the noise that is there is not unpleasant (unlike the blotchy results I would get from the Canon at those speeds). The grip feels great in my hand. The viewfinder display is very usable. I don't find myself accidentally adjusting the exposure compensation as I often would on the Canon. Auto-bracketing: check. Matrix metering with AI-S lenses - Woo Hoo!
I could not be happier with this purchase. Great value.

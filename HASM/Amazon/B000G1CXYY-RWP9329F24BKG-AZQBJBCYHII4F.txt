Title: nice little heater
Content:
Bought this a few months ago, still pleased with it. It's actually surprising how much heat comes out of such a small heater. Maybe it's just me, but after a couple weeks of use, it seemed to "break in" and really pump out heat. Not that it wasn't good before that. Especially for the price, this is a great buy, and heats my small- to medium-size room well. You'll have to turn it on and off manually, but oh well.

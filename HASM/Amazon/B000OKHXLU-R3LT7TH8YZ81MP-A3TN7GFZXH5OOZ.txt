Title: Overpriced Fan
Content:
This unit is certainly an overpriced awkward shaped air blower.  It does blow air and circulates it from side to side, but it is only cool during the first 30 minutes after putting cold water in the tray.  We have found it to be a great noise maker to mask the night sounds (traffic, loud neighbors, etc.), but but outside of that, it doesn't have a special filter like the original ad claimed, and it doesn't really change the temperature of the room all that much.  It is nice around children, though, when you don't want little hands to get into a standard room fan...

Title: Best MP3 option available out there
Content:
This MP3 player is best player available out there, for me the key things why I zeroed on to this one are:
-ability to browse through folders like ones does in a computer and organize videos and audio that way; audio upto 7 levels of directories and video 2 or 3
-ability to start from where you left in a track necessary for reading audio books
-ability to forward or backward in a audio book; helps to relisten to something important
-other features like good battery life, large flash, good sound/picture quality, small size
The other player that came close was insignia but was large in size and I did not use it all that much I liked Sony better. Will likely buy one for my wife

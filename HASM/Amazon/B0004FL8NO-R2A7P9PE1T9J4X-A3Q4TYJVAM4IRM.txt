Title: Makes weak half-pot, but nice carafe-based design
Content:
Straight-forward design with a nice carafe, but doesn't heat the water enough, and makes a weak half-pot.
Like most low-end coffee-makers, this unit doesn't get the water to the optimal brewing temperature if 195-200F .  Using the usual recommendation of cold water resulted in unusually flat/weak coffee compared to the old Cusinart I was replacing, and the cold carafe made it even worse: lukewarm weak coffee.
Using room-temperature water and pre-warming the carafe with hot water helps, but isn't a substitute for getting the water temperature high enough.
My usual serving size of a half-pot (4-5 cups) brews too rapidly, further weakening the flavor, and prompted me to return the unit.  There is no "small pot" setting like in the Cusinarts.
The unit is a little cheap and plastic-y looking, especially the water tank, but construction seemed solid.
The carafe is well-made, but it takes a try or two to get the spring-loaded cap positioned correctly under the basket for brewing.  The same cap also holds water after washing, though I was able to press it "open" and shake it dry.
Unfortunately, I only came across a Cook's Illustrated coffee-maker review that mentions the same issues I encountered, after I had already tried the unit.
This machine is adequate for a whole pot with the precautions of warmer water and warmed carafe, but coffee-fanatics should look elsewhere.

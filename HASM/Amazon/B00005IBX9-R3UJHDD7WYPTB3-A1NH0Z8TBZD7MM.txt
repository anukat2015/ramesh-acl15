Title: Finally, a coffee maker that will last!
Content:
I always utilize Amazon's reviews when we're in the market for something new, so I thought I'd chip in my opinion this time.  We drink a LOT of coffee, and we've been through 4 coffeemakers in the past year or so.  This is the one that will last.  It has every conceivable feature and is very sturdy.  Never even knew Cuisinart made coffeemakers, but I searched Amazon for the top rated coffeemaker, and there it was.  Not too much more in terms of cost than the lower end Mr. Coffees and the like, and definitely worth the investment. We really like this pot and definitely recommend it.

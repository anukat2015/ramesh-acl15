Title: Warranty is worthless and the customer service staff is rude and useless.
Content:
I purchased my laptop from Amazon in May of 2009.  Approximately 8 months into it, the hinge system started falling apart on the left hand side.  I entered into a chat session with customer service.  They sent a box to pack the computer in to send in for repairs under the warranty.  I received a call from a case manager who accused me of dropping the laptop and said that "even if what I said were the truth" and it wasn't dropped, it wouldn't be covered anyway because it would be considered normal wear and tear.  He wanted over $400 to repair the computer.  I told him to just send it back to me.  Upon receiving it, my lcd screen is now broken.  Believe it or not, they will not accept any responsibility for the damage to my computer.  2 out of 3 of the customer service reps I spoke with in the repair division were incredibly rude.  I am not an engineer but even I know that this is a design flaw.  The lcd screen is just too heavy for the hinge system to survive over a very long period of time with even minimal use.  I couldn't be any more disappointed in a company.  They will not take responsbility for their own faulty product.  In my case, to make an even bad situation worse, they caused further damage and won't even make any effort to correct the problem.  I will never, ever buy another product from HP.

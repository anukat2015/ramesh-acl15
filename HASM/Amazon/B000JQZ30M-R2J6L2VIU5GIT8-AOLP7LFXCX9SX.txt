Title: Great small heater
Content:
We purchased two of these heaters after we had our basement remodeled last year. We thought it would take two units to heat our basement but to our surprize we were sweating because it was too warm. Cleveland winters can be VERY cold but they are no problem for these little heaters. We now use our other heater for our master bedroom instead of turning up the furnace. We love our heaters and so does everyone else who visits. We get so many complements on how nice it looks and the fact that it's so small but works great. I highly recommend this heater. 
I felt compelled to leave a review because that's the first place I look before I purchase online. Hope this helps your decision.

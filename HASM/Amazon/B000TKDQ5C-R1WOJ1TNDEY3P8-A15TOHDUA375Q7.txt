After more than 20 years of very good service, my small Lakewood heater thru sparks and caught fire.  Lakewood is out of business, so this one could not be replaced.  
For trustworthy shopping on good products, I always turn to Amazon.com.  After much research on your products, I decided on the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat.  This heater really does put out a lot of heat on low setting for my whole living room.  When the room begins to cool down, it comes back on very quietly for a few minutes and all is fine.  Being old and cold natured, this heater is a blessing. 
Most important, this small portable Lasko really heats up my bathroom fast so that I can shower and wash my hair.  Getting naked in the cold would make daily ADL's impossible.   
For 14 continuous days in January, we had record low temps below freezing (mostly in the teens) and everyone had to run their central heat a lot.  Not me, my little heater took care of the living room and I was able to leave my thermostat on the central heat set at 52 degrees.  My Feb. Talquin Electric Cooperative bill is $65.93 (regular is $36.53) which is o.k. as we have been way below normal for several weeks now.  Without this wonderful space heater, my power bill would be much higher.  
I hope and pray this Lasko 754200 last 20 or more years, if not, it was still very reasonable at $22.99.

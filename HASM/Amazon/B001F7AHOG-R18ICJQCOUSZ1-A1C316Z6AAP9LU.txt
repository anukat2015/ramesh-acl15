Title: Largest amount of storage of all the iPods!
Content:
I recently upgraded via Santa my old 20 GB iPod to the new 160 GB iPod classic.  I love the extra capacity and the color screen (yeah my old one was really old).  The smaller size is nice but won't fit any of my old carrying cases.  It is also not backward compatible with my old FM tuner.  I was surprised at how clear the tiny screen was and found that I can watch saved TV and video podcast programs comfortably.  All the better to tune the world out during layovers at the airport.  The click wheel is still not my favorite way to navigate but works as intended, just have to get the feel for this new one and maybe it needs to get a little broken in to work as good as my old one.  The sound level is better (louder) on this one than the old and the ability to lock the sound level to prevent it getting too lound is interesting.  Overall, very happy with the purchase.

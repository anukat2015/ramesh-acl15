Title: Best camera ever!
Content:
I have been a serious photographer for 58 years, most of these as a professional.  I have seen some awesome cameras, but the Nikon D40x is by far the most phenominal I have ever used.  I can't even imagine what would make this any better.
    My only complaint was that when I received my camera it came without a memory card.  I should have picked up on this before it arrived, but I supposed that a camera "kit" would include everything I needed to get started.  Not a big problem, but inconvenient.

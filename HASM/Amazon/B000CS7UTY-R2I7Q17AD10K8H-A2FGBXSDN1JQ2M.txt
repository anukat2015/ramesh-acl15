Title: Harddrive Crash after 90 days, other reviews same problem
Content:
Player only Says "HARDDRIVE PROBLEM" Worked fine for 90 days then crashed, Now being charged $25.00 to have it looked at by Creative labs, since it is after 90 days. It's says 1 year warranty, but after 90 you have to pay $25.00 to get it fixed. Still cheap. Tech support took over 48hrs to reply, and when they did they try to sell you stuff for a broken player. This is in the tech email. "Please be patient and we'll figure this out. In the meantime, feel free to visit our website and see the entire line of accessories that we have for the Zen Vision:M. They will definitely help you get the most of your music experience. Here is the link" 
The only thing the Zen has going for it and why 2 stars is the picture is nice and clear. Will not buy any creative labs again, this is the 3rd product, the others being speakers, all have broken or poorly manufactured. I have had better luck with lower end products.

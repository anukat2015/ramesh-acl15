Title: Good value for hardwood floor maintenance
Content:
This is a good value for a lightweight vac that can be used to keep hardwood floors clean on a daily basis.  It doesn't work very well on tile or carpet.  It has a very long cord, but it isn't retractable, which is a pain.  For the money, however, it does basically what I need it to do.

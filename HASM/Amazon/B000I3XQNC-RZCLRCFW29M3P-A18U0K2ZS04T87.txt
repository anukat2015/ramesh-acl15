Title: Amazing camera for the price
Content:
This really an amazing camera for the money.  I've paired it with the original kit lens, as well as some of the pricey L lenses, and the results are quite impressive.  I recently upgraded to the 40D, and haven't used it much yet.  The reason for upgrading was to get the faster rate of 6.5 fps (the xti is 3 fps).  If it wasn't for that... and that is quite minor even, then I would have stayed with the xti for a long time to come.  You can't beat it for the price.

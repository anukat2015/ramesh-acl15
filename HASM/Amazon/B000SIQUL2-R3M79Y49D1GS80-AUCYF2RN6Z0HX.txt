Title: My most comfortable winter ever.
Content:
I love my Thermoflo Smart Heat Heater.  Once it has gotten the room to a comfortable temperature it is very quiet. Even when it is just starting to heat up a cold room it is quieter than most other heaters with a fan.   I live in a one bedroom apt. and when it is really cold I just point it more in the direction of the room that I am in at the time.  It was only designed to do one room but I did just fine with one heater and 2+ rooms all winter. And yes it is nice even warmth, no cold spots.  
I also like that it is small and lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go.

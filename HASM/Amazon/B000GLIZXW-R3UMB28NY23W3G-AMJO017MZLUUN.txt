Title: Dimplex Fire Logs
Content:
After much online review, I chose the Dimplex firelog set for my use. I replaced some LP gas logs to reduce costs. I do not need a extreme heat producer for my house in Florida and the ambiance of the Dimplex logs is very good. The unit does produce a small amount of heat and I suppose if you left the unit on for several hours it would heat a small room. I strongly recommend this unit for an application as I have.

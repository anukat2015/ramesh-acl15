Title: What a steal!!!!!
Content:
After putting up with my old Dell Pocket DJ for years, the Zen is like a breath of fresh air. I still can't believe I was able to purchase it for only $125.00. Apparently, it was a closeout because one week later there were none left. The sound quality and ease of operation is outstanding and the volume balancing between songs actually works!
The only criticism I have is that the software that comes loaded is quite prone to lockups, especially when dealing with large volumes of music. Once I downloaded the latest software form their web site, the Zen has not locked up once. I have a large collection of MP3 and WMA files and they work like a charm. Once I realized what an excellent player this was, I went back to Yahoo to purchase another but they were gone. If you can still find one, buy it!

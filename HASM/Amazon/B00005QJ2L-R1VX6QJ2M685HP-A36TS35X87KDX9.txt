Title: Sat 1805 review
Content:
I am very pleased with the performance of my Satellite 1805. Weighing at 7 lbs. and under 2 inches thick, it is ideal for work(Windows ME) or play(great DVD) for a systems that  is under $1200. More than enough system memory(128MB) and HD(15-GIG) for what I need.A very good box at a very, very affordable price!

Title: Another Great Olympus Product
Content:
Once agian, I am very happy with Olympus' offerings.  I was a former Olympus owner going back to their 1.3MP days.  I wondered away from Olympus for a while to try out other brands, with much disappointment, the old 1.3MP camera still took clearer and warmer pictures than my 4-5MP non-Olympus cameras.  Since then, I have made my way back to Olympus, purchasing this camera in December.  I have been very happy with it so far, and I love the interfaces because they are very similar to my 2 older Olympus models.  It is nice for previous Olympus owners, because there is very little you have to learn in terms of menu navigation if you had a good grasp of the features on your older camera.  The pictures it takes are great so far, I have had no trouble with the white balance yet, and love the image stabilization feature, since I prefer to take low light pictures without a flash.  You really can't beat the 2 lens package for the price as well.

Title: excellent performance
Content:
bought this cam a month ago and have snapped hundreds of pics. haven't had any problem with AF/noise with the kit lens or the 50mm f1.8. colors are great, sharpness needed to be buffed up in standard mode, excellent placement of the control buttons...very easy to manuver. didn't like the built-in flash so bought 430ex and bouncing off the walls/ceiling with great results. light weight cam with decent build. dont expect wonders with the kit lens..not that sharp at the edges...the 50 mm is pretty good tho for the price and it is FAST!! thanks to amazon for outstanding service and prompt delivery. i m on a tight budget at present..would welcome suggestions/comments on what lenses to buy and other aspects of photography. i m not a pro, and pics are made for my own pleasure/enjoyment.

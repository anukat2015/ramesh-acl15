Title: Just looks no action
Content:
This machine looks great but performance is low in our opinion.We bought one and the machine overflowed. It seams like the carafe is not tall enough to activate the opening to let the coffee flow out so we got another and the same problem along with the fact that it would not stop when you remove the carafe.The little water filter is also a bust so this time I will try something else...

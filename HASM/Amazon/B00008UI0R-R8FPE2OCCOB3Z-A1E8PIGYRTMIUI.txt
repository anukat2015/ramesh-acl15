Title: great vacuum - it's my second!
Content:
The wind tunnel is small and very maneuverable, light weight, and has every attachment I need, including some I didn't even know I needed till I bought this vacuum.  There is a special stair (and furniture) attachment that is small and motor driven that does a great job on stairs without the work of a heavy front attachment.  The vacuum also has suction around the sides of the main unit so you get the curvy edges of furniture as you go around them and the close edges of walls.  The cord is extra long, as is the hose, so you can reach pretty much anything.  This is my second unit, and yes, the first one still works.

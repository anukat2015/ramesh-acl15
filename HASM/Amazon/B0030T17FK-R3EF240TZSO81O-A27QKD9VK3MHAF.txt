Title: Bad Screen and No Service
Content:
I bought my Dell Inspiron a few months back. It has become apparent that it is not what I am needing. The screen resolution - although 15.6" large only produces a stretched 1024x768 style image that leaves me unable to see most apps.
In addition the mouse cursor stops working periodically and Dell says they will not take a trade-in or return since it is past 21 days. Instead they asked me to buy a new one. The one-year service is a joke because they will not help with the problem.
Seriously, I do not think I will buy Dell again. I even offered to upgrade if they just gave me 50% of the machines value in trade-credit but no they said enjoy your Dell.

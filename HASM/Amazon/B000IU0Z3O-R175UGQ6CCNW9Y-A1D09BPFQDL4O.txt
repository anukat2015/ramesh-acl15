Title: Powreful economical vacuum cleaner.
Content:
We have a couple of vacuum cleaners and needed one for the garage. This cleaner does a great job. It is powerful, light weight and does a great job. It doesn't take up much space on a shelf and we are very pleased with the unit. With 3 cars to clean and a garage area, we use it at least once a week. Everything about the unit works well. The utensils are light duty in fabrication, but they work just fine.

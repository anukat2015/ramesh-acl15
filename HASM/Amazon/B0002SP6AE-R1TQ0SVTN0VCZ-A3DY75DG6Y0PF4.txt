Title: I wouldn't install it if it was free
Content:
I've replaced two of these.  The way the thermostat snaps into its base is a bad design.  It doesn't necessarily make good contact with the base.  Our fan would come on, but not the rest of the AC.  They're controlled by separate wires, one made contact the other didn't.  If I pushed on the thermostat with my thumb, the AC comes on until I let go.
There is no reason to buy a defective design.  Other brands have similarly priced similarly featured units without the removable thermostat that might not turn the AC fully on.

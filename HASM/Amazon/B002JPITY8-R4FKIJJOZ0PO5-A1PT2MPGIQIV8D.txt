Title: Best MP3 Player I owned
Content:
This is the best MP3 player I ever owned. I am an iPhone user, used iPod's - Zune HD one is a much better MP3 player.
- Zune Pass: For $15/month you get to own 10 songs and can listen to almost any song available in store from millions of songs
- If you have an xbox 360, Zune HD and Zune Marketplace are all compatible and will play well with your xbox 360
- Better UI: Easier to use, cool graphics

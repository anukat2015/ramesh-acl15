Title: Garbage
Content:
This vacuum is pure garbage! The beater bar won't work unless the rear wheels are held up...Half the time the control buttons don't work. I took it apart to check it and now it works if I keep the screws out. When it works, it does work, but you have to empty the canister way too often. 
My opinion, don't waste your money.  I turely hate this vacuum!
I wish someone still sold the Fantum Lightning Canister Vacuum. I loved that one!

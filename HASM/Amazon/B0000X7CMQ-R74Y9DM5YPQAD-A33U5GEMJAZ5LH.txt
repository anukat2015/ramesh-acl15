Title: In its fourth year
Content:
Like every other coffee maker we've ever used, the Zoji BD15 has good points and some not-so-good points.  On the plus side, it brews fast and hot (in testing, the Zoji was one of the few coffee makers to brew at a proper 195-200F temperature), and if you preheat its thermal carafe with hot tap water prior to brewing, its keep-warm performance is excellent. Coffee stays hot for several hours.  Also, even though the unit is plastic and lightweight, it's been in daily service in our house for over three years now without any failed parts.
On the down side, this unit involves a learning curve: don't overtighten the carafe lid, make sure the carafe is centered under the brew spout, turn the lid and precisely line the dots up when pouring, etc.  Also, double-crimped #4 Melita filters are too tall for the Zoji's brewing chamber, so you have to either snip 1/4" off the tops of the filters, or use cheaper filters. Finally, as mentioned in other reviews, this coffee maker is about 15.25" tall and won't fit under many kitchen cupboards (fortunately it does fit under ours).
All in all we'd recommend the BD15 with the above in mind.

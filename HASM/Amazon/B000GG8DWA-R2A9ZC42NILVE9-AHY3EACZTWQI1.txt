Title: Extremely satisfied
Content:
We wanted a small heater for our travel trailer,that does not have a fan, to heat our trailer during cold nights when we are are sleeping. Our gas furnace heater is noisy and wakes us up as it cycles on and off during the night. This heater works fine, keeps us warm during extremely cold nights and does not wake us up.

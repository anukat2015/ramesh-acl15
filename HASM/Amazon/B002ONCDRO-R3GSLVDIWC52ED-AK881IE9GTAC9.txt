Title: Excellent quality fitting the budget
Content:
This is the only kind of computer offering the best performance at its price. I have been looking for the best computer to fit my budget below $900. Comparing between many different popular brand, this kind give you the best stuff at a low budget. However, Sysmantec anti-virus feature is only trial for 60 days. Sound quality is good but not so loud to hear rock music. Overall, 17.3" computer has dual core,500GB hard drive, 4GB RAM and good video card. This is as much good as you can get out of your money. Trust me on this! I spent 2 month waiting for the right stuff!

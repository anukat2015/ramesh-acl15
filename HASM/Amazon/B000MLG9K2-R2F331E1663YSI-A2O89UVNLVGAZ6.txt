Title: So far, so good but filters will reflect light off the lenses
Content:
So far, so good, but if you use a UV filter you will find that shots taken in low light or those involving prolonged shutter exposure will cause light to reflect off of the lenses. If it was possible for me to attach an example to this review I would attach about 100 pics I shot within the past 2 weeks. Other than that this camera is easy and fun to learn. Metering off of objects is a breeze and many photo editing options are built in to the camera. The only drawback to camera operation is that sometimes the autofocus does not know what to lock onto if there is too much sky or solid color in the picture, which will prevent the camera from taking the picture unless you switch it to manual operation.

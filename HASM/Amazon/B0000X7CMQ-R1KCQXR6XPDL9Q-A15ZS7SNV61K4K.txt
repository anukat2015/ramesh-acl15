Title: Great coffee and reliability!
Content:
I have owned this coffee maker for five years.  It has been dependable and consistently produced fine coffee.  I love the fact that there is no warming up after it is brewed.  The coffee stays hot in the supplied carafe for several hours after it is made.
I am about to order another one.  I can't find any other brand that is as reliable.  (I've been making coffee for over 30 years!)
I can only hope that the new one is as good as the current one.

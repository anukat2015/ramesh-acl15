Title: Dimplex DF12309 Electric Fireplace Insert
Content:
This unit looks nice but is way over priced for what it is. If you are planning on getting good heat from the unit, forget it. It produces a small amount of heat only about one foot in front of your fireplace. I get better heat from a $12.00 heater with the same wattage and btu output. At the high setting the fan is to low, probably for sound reduction, and it may as well not even have the low speed setting. If you want something to look pretty in your empty fireplace then this will work. Sitting in there by itself looks bad unless you purchase (separately) the fireplace trim and screen kit that all looks good when completed. The problem? Thats right, the cost. Another $200.00 plus. And when it comes time to change the 2 bulbs that create the simulated look of fire, you have to take it all apart. Half the price for the combined package would be a fair value.

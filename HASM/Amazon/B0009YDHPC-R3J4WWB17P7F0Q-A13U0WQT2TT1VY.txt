Title: Not a good idea
Content:
My new combo arrived just a week after I ordered it.  As I pulled it out of the box, I discovered the glass coffee pot was broken.  I called customer service the next morning and they said they would send a replacement pot. (I never received a confirmation about that.)  So no coffee right away but I still had the espresso machine.  It was no problem to make a nice strong cup of espresso.  My only complaint was that the filter basket had a small circumference so I couldn't use the new tamper I bought to go with the machine. The second day I used the machine, the plastic handle broke off in my hand when I connected the filter basket to the machine.  So now the coffee side could not be used and the espresso side needed pliers in order to use it.
I called the company again and they offered a replacement machine but I would rather get a partial refund.  I will go back to my 20 year old model since it is better made and I'll live with its quirks while I renew my research.

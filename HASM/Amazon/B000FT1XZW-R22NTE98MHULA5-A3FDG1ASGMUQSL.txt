Title: Ok
Content:
This heater is ok- it doesn't dry out the air as much as heaters that blow out air. And it heats up the whole room fast. The only thing I don't like is that the thermostat isn't accurate. On setting 2 for example it might make the room 67 degrees or it might make it 73 degrees, and that's a big difference.

Title: nice camera but alittle small
Content:
I had this camera for about a week now. I bought an EF 28-105mm lens seperatly. I don't know why, but the auto focus did not work right away.It took some fiddling around before I was able to use the feature. I get gorgeous pictures with this camera. My one complaint is it feels small in the right hand. After 1/2 hour of shooting pictures my hand got a cramp. I have small hands and it still felt small to me. If you are considering this camera I'd go to a store see how it feels. I can't imaging being able to use it for a long time if you have a big hands. 
I'm still learning how to use it. But so far its meeting all my expectations.

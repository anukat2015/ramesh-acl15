Title: Excellent Gaming Laptop
Content:
I got the model x505-q830 because about $450 less than q850, the q830 and q850 are same xcept 850 has two 2g more memory and resolution 1920x1000 and 830 has 1685x950. The reason I choose this laptop over other because it comes with everything,from bluetooth to blueray and it even enery star, latest i7 process, even the great sound speaker with aluminum cover not existing plastic hole and the volume touch control is near top medle left for fast easy excess. The wireless get 5 bars or 80% signal even through two walls that about 15 feet from router or 95 to 100% 10 feet without wall, so use build in wireles N and wireless N router instead of 
wireless G which I has interuption on the past with my other laptop and after switch to wireless N, solve the problem. Sofar I have call of duty 4, world at war,and hawx with max resolution 1685x950 and they are run perfectly and I play Cod 4 and Wow online everyday since I got it without problem, I get a slight lag on some maps but I can not blame this laptop because my DSL server is $12.99 which is least expensive and slowest speed, but overal it running great and fun exprience online gameplay. 
Surfing the web is fast and zero issue, like open Amazon page within 2 seconds or so. Oh from sufing to gaming the graphic is great and the webcam hd like compare to 
my other laptop. The only wair issue I had was that after first time settup and tried to install game and tried to play video disc but it won't do anything like if 
the computer could not read or know what in the disc slot so I call tech support after serval mines and could not fix and the tech told me to call Amazon for help. 
Then decide to delete preinstall trail software Norton(a useless,slow your system,a creats issue piece of #$@&*!)and then update window then the problem of install 
game and play dvd is solve. I am more then happy with purchase this laptop and think it going to be my most pride gedget,Toshiba did a great job, keep up, this is my 
second Toshiba, the first still useful not for newer game, even after 3 years using it.

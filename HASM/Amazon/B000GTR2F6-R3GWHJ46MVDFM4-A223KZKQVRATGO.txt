Title: great machine but not durable
Content:
We purchased this model through Amazon in April of 2008. It had normal home use. It started shorting out and not working properly after about 6 months of use. I contacted Keurig and was advised that I did not descale frequently enough (rather impolitely, I might add). Since the booklet recommends descaling every 3-6 months, and I use only filtered water, blaming me for the motor burnout seems a little unfair. They replaced the unit but with the cheaper model. 
   The coffee is great, the tea even better, the convenience and ease of use fabulous. If they continue to honor the one year warranty I'm happy about that. I'm not really pleased about the prospect of spending a couple of hours every month heating up and smelling white vinegar as I  flush my delicate little coffee machine.

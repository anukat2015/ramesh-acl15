Title: No Problems
Content:
I received my re-manufactured DTC-975 and it appears to be the latest model with stainless on front of basket and overfull hole in the basket. It appears that the problems with overflowing could not happen with this model as long as the swing-out basket is fully closed and the carafe is placed straight in base. If coffee could not get through the filter to carafe it would overflow and go to the pouring trough and into the carafe, no mess but most likely grounds in the carafe but no flood on the countertop. This coffee maker keeps coffee hot a lot longer then my previous Mr. Coffee Thermal coffee maker. My only dislike of this unit is it's slow pouring feature, not a major problem.

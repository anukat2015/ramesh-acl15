Title: Glad I waited - RCA jet stream is worth it
Content:
I had this shipped to me here in the UK as it was just reviewed in a gadget mag and it looked like what I was after. I have never had an MP3 player before and never wanted the whole i-pod thing. I am doing a 26 mile walk for charity and wanted something that was not too cumbersome - love those wireless headphones and would last the distance (14 hours battery time) 340 songs is plenty for what I want it for. 
Its easy to use, I would say that it works better with the arm band rather than the wrist band, so it obvisouly helps to be nearer for better clarity.
I am really enjoying using it at the moment - and the pedometer is actually quite accurate - considering it is on your arm, as opossed to your hip.
Can't wait to take it with me on my moonwalk in May - if anyone wants to help me raise loads for breast cancer then please email me for details - you can donate on line.
Great product, glad I waited til I found an mp3 player that is so me.

Title: Excellent value
Content:
You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to show pictures and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. The new 30 and 80 GB models have improved battery life, but I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase.

Title: iPod Touch Does It All
Content:
This does everything it says it does and more, and not wanting to pay for full-time  cell phone internet service, the newest iPod Touch fills the bill very well.  It is easy to use, intuitive, and great fun.    My 32GB is more than capacious with many apps (mostly free) , currently 91 iTunes University lectures,  and many CD uploads.  I am amazed at the quality of video podcasts I download.  I still have 80% of available capacity.  My wife fell in love with it so she'll soon have her own 16GB iPod Touch, saving about $100.00.  Great with home Wi-Fi and easy to connect to public hotspots.

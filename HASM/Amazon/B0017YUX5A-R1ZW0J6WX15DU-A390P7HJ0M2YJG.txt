Title: Piece of junk
Content:
My wife liked the first one we got 1 year ago so much, we ordered a second one 2 months later. Fortunately, that was a good decision, as it has taken both of them in order to keep at least one unit functioning at any one time. After only one year of use, both units are ready for the recycler after a laundry list of repairs. Do not buy this unit.

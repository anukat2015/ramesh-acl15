Title: not an indoor stove as adv. per their own instructions
Content:
this is advertised as an indoor stove to heat water for uses like a shower while camping. I bought it for 123.46. When it arrived promptly the instructions stated don't use inside dangerous, could be fatal etc.
I contacted seller and manufacturer which both stated their lawyers made them write it but it wasn't true. I should go ahead and use it anyway and ignore their instructions.
Yeah right. When my 5 kids end up dead what then?
They refuse to reimb. me for shipping rtn. of $29.75. Now I have placed no less then 14 long over an hour each calls to Amazon to invoke the A-Z amazon guarantee to get refund and rtn shipping. Never deal with these people. A complete nightmare.

Title: Don't Listen to Negative Reviews!
Content:
I did a lot of research before deciding to buy my MP3 player.  My last one (a Zen) was stolen and I had been looking to upgrade.  I was very excited to hear about the Zune however, many reviews that I read spoke negatively about the Zune but I decided to take a chance and buy one anyway....and let me tell you,  I don't know what they were talking about!  I love my Zune!  All the negative things such as the poor clarity of the screen, etc. are not noticeable, unless you are extremely picky.
The only so called drawbacks that I've noticed are:  the Zune Marketplace does not offer videos (you can easily get videos from another source) and the package does not come with a wall charger (one can be purchased on Amazon for under $7.00)
The things I love about my Zune are:  it is user friendly,
the horizontal video feature, great sound quality, I get great reception on every radio station in my area plus it tells me what song is playing and who its by, the customizable background is fun and scrolling through to find tracks is very easy.  Overall, my Zune suits all my  portable audio visual needs and is one of the most fun pieces of technology that I own.

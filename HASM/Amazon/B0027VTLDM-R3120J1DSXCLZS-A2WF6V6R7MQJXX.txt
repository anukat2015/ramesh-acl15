Title: Think twice if you are a light sleeper and using for bedroom
Content:
The fan is not loud, but I wouldn't say it is quiet either.  The annoying thing is that there is no option to leave the fan on continuously, so it cycles on and off with the heater.  The problem with this is that you don't have a constant white noise to aid sleeping, but something that could make sleeping not so restful--or worse yet--wake you up.  Also using the remote to change any settings creates a loud beep that your sleeping partner might not be so happy about.
I did notice that a smallish room heated up very fast.  I'm guessing the large size helps with that.
The remote is sorta cheap, but does the job--with a lot of beeps.  
I would say it is a good value at the price I paid: $49.

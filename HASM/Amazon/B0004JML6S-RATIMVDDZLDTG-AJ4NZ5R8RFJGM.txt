Title: The negative reviewers must work for a Krups competitor
Content:
This coffee maker is very handsome, quickly creates a marvelous carafe of coffee, the carafe does NOT drip when poured, and it has a lovely alert signal that's not obnoxious to let you know when your entire pot of coffee has been dispensed.  What's not to like?  I am a coffee fanatic and have owned Bunn, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee, Braun and many others.  This one is wonderful, and it's an amazing value at this price.  I'm writing this because I truly think the negative reviewers must either work for a Krups competitor or they are tea drinkers who wouldn't know the difference between a good or bad coffee maker.

Title: Excellent Camera for non-flash pics
Content:
This camera is amazing, you can take pics in low light conditions (at a resturant) without a flash and still get great photos. The image stabilization allows you to do this, without a tripod. At weddings and such flash pics are just are not as nice as natural light pics. The 12.1 megapixal allows pics to be blown up without a loss of detail.

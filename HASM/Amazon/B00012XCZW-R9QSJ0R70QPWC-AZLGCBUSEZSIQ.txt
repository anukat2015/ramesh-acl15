Title: Evaporation...
Content:
I have owned a Bunn coffee maker for the past 20 years (not the same one). I have always found them to be excellent working and long lasting. My one complaint is that of evaporation. If you do not use this coffee maker every single day, the water in the reservoir evaporates and when you go to brew your next pot it does not fill it completely. So, you have one of three choices to make. First, you can pour more water in to get a full pot, but you will be guessing at the correct amount and you will have to wait while it continues to brew with the new water you have poured in. Second, you can run just water through it the first time to get the water level in the reservoir to the proper level, but this too takes time. Third, you can drink it like it is (usually kind of strong). That is the only thing that I do not like, have never liked, about Bunn coffee makers.

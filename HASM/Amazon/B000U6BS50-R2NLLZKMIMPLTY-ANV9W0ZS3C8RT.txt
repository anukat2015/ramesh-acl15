Title: love it
Content:
I LOVED MY BROOM VAC SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER.I HAVE THE RED AND SHE HAS THE CITRON GREEN. ONLY DRAWBACK I CAN SEE IS YOU HAVE TO CLEAR LOTS OF HAIR AND STUFF AWAY FROM THE FILTER EVERYOTHER TIME YOU USE IT TO GET GREAT SUCTION BUT THATS EASY ENOUGH TO DO. YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT PICKS UP. I THOUGHT MY FLOORS WERE CLEAN BEFORE BUT NOW THEY ARE!

Title: Super product, great way to afford it
Content:
I'm delighted with my refurbished Electolux.  My mother and grandmother both owned the brand, but until this refurbished model they were too pricey for me.  The powered head and carpet adjustability allow for excellent suction that includes cat hair and a horrible Christmas glitter spill.  Despite the two motors, it's substantially quieter than any vacuum I've owned before.  Freedom from buying bags is wonderful, and I can actually see what's being picked up -- an amazing amount of deep-down dust and dirt.  Although the unit is heavy for its size, it's small, rounded and maneuverable, and I don't need to bend my back at all to operate it.  It's easy to pick up by the wide handle, too.  The retractable (nice!) cord is unusually long,  I also love having the handheld parts onboard, and the hose detaches with ease.  Everything about it is engineered for convenience and all the parts snap in and out securely and very easily, unlike the multiplicity of appliances requiring me to stand on my head and ease something into its place perfectly or it won't fit, gets stuck, falls out, etc.  The parts are sound and seem to be of high quality, too.  I'm very satisfied.

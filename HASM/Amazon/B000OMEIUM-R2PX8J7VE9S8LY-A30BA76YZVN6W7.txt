Title: I like it,
Content:
I like it, awesome display, monitor is great, very clear crisp, great color.  Sound is pretty good, not as good as my HIFI home system, but best I ever had in a laptop. 
Only complaint is that it was a little buggy until I upgraded the memory.  I only replaced one of the 526 mb with a 1GB stick.  I am running about 1.5 gb memory and its all good now.
Lots of features, and plugs on the outside I havent even used yet. It has a card slot for my digi camera memory card right in front, nice not having to find that cable to upload video ad pics. 
4 stars!

Title: Wonderful Camera body!
Content:
Definite FIVE STARS!!!  I am a Canon girl all the way.  I've had the S3 IS, the SD630, the SD900, the Rebel XTi, the Rebel XSi, and now the 1D Mark III.  I can't believe the difference between the XSi and the 1D Mark III.  From the overall feel of the body, to the shutter sound, to the quality of the photos.  The dual processors make a huge difference.  Combined with the extensive line of Canon lenses, this is a phenomenal camera.  I am sold on the professional line, though the XSi will now become my back-up body for when I shoot weddings, etc.

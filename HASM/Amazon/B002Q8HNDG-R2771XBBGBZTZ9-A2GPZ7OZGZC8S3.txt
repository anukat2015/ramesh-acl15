Title: Short lifespan
Content:
Purchased this unit because it is exactly the right size for us plus automatic shut off.  After seven brewing cycles it quit working, won't turn on when push the button, just makes a clicking sound from somewhere inside.
It is likely this will be our last Mr Coffee purchase as they seem to have shorter and shorter lifespans.

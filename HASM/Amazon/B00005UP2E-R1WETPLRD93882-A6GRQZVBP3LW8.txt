Title: Dirt Devil
Content:
I'm very pleased with the Dirt Devil canister vacuum. I was looking for a light weight machine & this one is definitely light weight. It's so easy to pull around and to pick up to move from room to room. Great on bare floors but may not have enough power to do a really good job on carpets.
Only semi-complaint I have is that the attachments seem to come undone from the wand too easily. I can't find a way to secure them.

Title: I like it
Content:
My husband asked for this specific coffee maker for Christmas. He had seen it at a friend's house and thought it worked great. He was right. This is our first experience with a coffee grinder so the noise was a bit of a surprise but I now know that all grinders whine loudly. The auto timer is nice so we can get up to freshly ground hot coffee. I like the thermal carafe (no heated plate). It keeps the coffee hot for hours. I do wash all the parts every time I set it up but I don't see that as a problem. Buy and enjoy!

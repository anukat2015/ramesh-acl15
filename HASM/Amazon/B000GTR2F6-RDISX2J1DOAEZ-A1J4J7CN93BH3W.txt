Title: Good product, good customer service
Content:
I got one of these through Amazon at Thanksgiving time 2009.  We loved it!!  Late February the brewer started the "shutdown after each cup" problem that seem to bedevil these otherwise fine units.  Were out of the 90 day Amazon return window and so contacted Keurig.  They didn't balk, FedEx-ed me a new unit with the included 12 cup assortment and a gift cert for $27 at their k-cup store.  I'll be reporting on the new unit in a few months!!!
1st rate customer service in my book!!

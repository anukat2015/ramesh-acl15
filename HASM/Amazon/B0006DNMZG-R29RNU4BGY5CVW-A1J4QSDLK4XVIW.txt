Title: Bought it for a friend
Content:
Even though I have not used this heater since I bought it for a gift, my friend says it is fantastic.  She says that it heats the room quickly and is amazingly quiet.  Best heater she has ever owned!  Uses very little electricity since it is efficient.  Price was terrific!(I live in Florida so I do not need one for myself.)

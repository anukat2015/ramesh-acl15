Title: Not for hardwoods.
Content:
I bought this model to replace an eight year old Hoover that had seen better days. My old model was such a great vacuum and I thought this one would be an upgrade. 
I have all hardwoods with a few rugs and a canister vacuum is usually best for hard surfaces. This canister is the exception to that rule. There is no separate floor tool so cleaning hardwood and vinyl is through the bulky power nozzle. This nozzle will suck up almost nothing that is on a hard surface with the power nozzle turned off as instructed. If you try to turn the power nozzle on and go over the hard surfaces then it scatters everything around. The only way to use this machine to clean these surfaces is with the 4 inch dusting tool. I gave up after only one room.
This is great on carpets but the dust cup that looks large in the picture, only holds about two cups of dust so I emptied the cup twice cleaning one rug. This machine is going back after only one try. Sorry CONSUMER REPORTS. You were wrong about this one.

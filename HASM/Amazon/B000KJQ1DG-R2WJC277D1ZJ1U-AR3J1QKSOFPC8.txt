Title: Amazing entry level DSLR. Careful... it'll suck you in!
Content:
The Nikon D40 is an amazing camera for somebody looking to get a little more serious about photography. The camera is easy to use as a point and shoot with the auto settings, but it's also easy to customize the settings as you use it more. The lens that comes with it is a great starter lens. Before this I only had point and shoot digitals, and after 8 months of owning this camera my photography is on a completely different level.
In fact, if you're like me you'll like this so much that you'll start buying lenses and flashes and spending a lot of spare time doing photography. 
Buy this over the new D60. It's a better price and a better camera.

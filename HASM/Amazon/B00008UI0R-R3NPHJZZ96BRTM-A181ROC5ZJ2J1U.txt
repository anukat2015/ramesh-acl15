Title: Better than expected, Great suction.  Brushes deep & powerful.
Content:
Worth the money.  We have this vacuum and a bottom of the line new 12 Amp upright.  On hard wood floors there is no difference.  There appears to be no difference for picking up larger items (i.e. crumbs, dust bunnies, etc.) on carpet.   But on there a difference on carpets; the Hoover picks up substantially more fine particles.  This is probably because the brushes are powerful and work deep into the carpet.  
Only 4 stars because of the following: 
No vacuum height adjustment, which we need for some thin hand-woven antique carpets.  The Hoover would wear these carpets out too fast.  The Hoover does have a floor setting which only sucks with out the rolling brush, but for our antique carpets, I like to have the brushes lightly brush the top of the carpet.  
Considered a Dyson, then decided I could just buy 3 vacuums in this price range; one every 4 or 5 years.    We use old vacuums for cleaning up spills, then if it gets too wet just through it out.

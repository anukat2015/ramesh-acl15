Title: LEAKS water out the bottom...DON'T BUY
Content:
I have had my coffee maker for about 3 years and only use it a couple times a week, at most.  It worked ok until recently, but now when you turn it on, most of the water leaks out the bottom making the little coffee it does make undrinkable.  The bottom is getting rusty and basically the product is unusable now.  I am looking into returning it, but from reading other posts and reviews, this will not be easy.  I would suggest buying a different brand of coffee maker altogether!

Title: Don't get this one for pet hair!
Content:
I've had my Miele Antares for about 3 years.  My beloved Electrolux needed it's motor replaced and the vacuum salesman convinced me that with what I'd spend on a new motor for my Electrolux, I'd be better off with a new Miele.  
Not so, as I am now shopping for a new vacuum. I have one dog and two cats, and the Miele just can't seem to scrub the dog hair off the carpet.  The roller brush in the carpet attachment has to be cleaned out every time I vacuum.  It is NOT easy to clean---hair has to be cut out of the brush with a scissors, and it's a mess.  I seem to have to replace the bags before they are full to get decent suction.  I have a tiny house--basically five rooms, and a bag lasts about one week. The pros are that it is lightweight and quiet.  The attachments on the handle keep getting knocked off when you go under furniture, and I've already lost the upholstery attachment because they fall off so easily.
It doesn't even do a great job on wood floors.  If I run a swiffer over the floor after I vacuum, it picks up so much stuff the vacuum missed.
If you have pet hair...don't buy this vacuum.

Title: Canon's Customer Relations
Content:
Ever had a problem with a camera?  Ever missed the e-tailers 30 day return policy?  Ever had to return the camera to the manufactor for repairs?  Well, I have.  To shorten this story I would like to say Canon stands behind their products.  My 7d's problem was an unidentifed error message(no number). This error occured whenever I made any adjustments or control changes. I returned the camera to Jamesburg, NJ with a full explaination and believe or not got the camera back in eight days.  Alas, it had the same problem.  I then called the factory tech and explained the problems.  She transfered me to the Customer Relations Dept. where they did not fiddle around with excuses, they replaced the camera with a new copy.  They also paid all shipping. My past expericences have not been close to this gradifing.  I have not read the Canon warranty, but I feel they could have thrown me into the cycle of shipping and reshipping only to return to the fact that I would have had no confidence in the $1,700.00 repaired/unrepaired camera.
I was able to take about 280 exposures with the camera before the onious errors occured and found the 7d is a delight to use.  Most exposures were clean and crisp, some where perhaps a little soft on the edges.  As I only shot in RAW with little post processing I was very happy with my results.

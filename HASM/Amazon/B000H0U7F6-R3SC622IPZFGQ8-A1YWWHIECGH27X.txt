Title: Great for smaller spaces
Content:
Just bought this at a local store for a bit less than here. It is amazing. It has a beam that shuts down the heater if something blocks it for more than 3 seconds and it puts out a lot of heat. I bought it for my bedroom but it could heat the whole upper level. The only draw back is no thermostat. Just on and off with a 4 hr timer option. Otherwise, I would buy this over and over again. Super heater.

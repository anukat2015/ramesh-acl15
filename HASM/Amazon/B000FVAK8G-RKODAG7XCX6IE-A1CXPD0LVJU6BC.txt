Title: DANGEROUS DEFECTIVE PROBLEM!
Content:
I've owned this for a little over a year. I was quite pleased with it until I noticed that my electrical outlet had black around it - I pulled the plug and saw that the plug was melting -  causing it to short.  - I blamed the outlet - only to find another outlet making hissing/sparking noises shortly thereafter (and more melting)-  the problem is the plug becomes warm - either by being close to the unit when on, or from electrical resistance - this warms up the rubber/plastic separating the prongs - causing the less electricity resistance - and voila you have a potentially lethal problem. Even with the unit off the plug will continue to spark/short/melt. Don't know why the circuit breaker didn't blow - it must not be enough to trigger.   Buyer beware. I'm contacting Honeywell today.

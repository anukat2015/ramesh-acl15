Title: Love at first click
Content:
I love this camera. I used to have an old Minolta XGM 35MM for many years and loved taking pictures so i decided to get back into photography and i waited for this ever since it was first announced by Canon. I got this and the 70-300 zoom and have been taking pictures everywhere. It takes fantastic pictures and make me look like a professional photographer. Now everyone I know, wants me to take pictures for them. The transaction was easy and happily uneventful. I received it on time and in fine condition. I received it from Ritz/Amazon. I am looking forward to taking classes so I can benefit from all the great features. I would highly recommend this if you have the dough!

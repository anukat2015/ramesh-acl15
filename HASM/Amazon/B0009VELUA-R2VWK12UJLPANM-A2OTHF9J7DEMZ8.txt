Title: It's got it's draw backs. Many of them.
Content:
A carafe-less coffee maker seemed like a good idea when I first saw the Cuisinart DCC-2000, so I bought it. It does make good coffee. But I soon found out the disadvantages of owning it. 
First was finding a container big enough to fill it without using glass after glass to fill it.
Second, was finding out I can't fill my thermos cup because it's to big. Again I have to pour coffee in another container and then into my thermos cup.
Next I find out that the coffee basket leaks when wanting to replace the coffee filter and add a new filter and coffee. That's because there is no shut off on the bottom of the basket as in pause and serve baskets, on other conventional coffee makers. The shut off on this is the button on front. That doesn't help changing the basket.
After a few months I kept finding coffee leaks under and around the coffee maker. Never did find out where it was coming out.
The clock has no back light, is small and is hard to see.
Anyway, it didn't take me long to dislike this carafe-less coffee maker, so I gave it to my neighbor.

Title: Thermostat unreliable
Content:
The thermostats are not reliable on these digital baseboard models. This was my second one that broke. You find yourself waking up - or worse your baby or kids waking up - to an 85 - 95 degree room sweating! The first one began doing this after not even a year of weekly use. I bought a second and it now does this also, fries us to 92 degrees when the thermostat is clearly set to 70. We've tried everything, unplugging and resetting the thermostat, but this Honeywell HZ-519 still heats up and up and up. Not recommended. Not reliable. A shame because it's nice and quiet and we like the way it heats. Go for the non-digital model if you can find them anywhere.

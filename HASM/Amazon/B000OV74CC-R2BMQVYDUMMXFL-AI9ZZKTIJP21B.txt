Title: Product breaks easily, and the company will not refund.
Content:
I bought a Sansa Express 2GB mp3 player at the beginning April.  By the beginning of May, it no longer worked, and it took SanDisk until the beginning July before they got me a replacement, different model mp3 player (I requested a refund, but they said they don't give those).  Before I bought the product, I read all the other reviews on here, and much of what is said in the 5-star reviews is quite true.  This product is easy to use, the screen is readable indoors (it is almost impossible to read in sunlight), and it was easy to transfer music files from my computer to the mp3 player, and to remove them afterward.
What kills this product for me, and the reason I would advise against buying it, is that it does not hold up to long-term use.  Online tech support is helpful, but not quick to respond; it took me a week, and several back-and-forth emails, from the time I started having problems with the device, to the time SanDisk admitted what I'd known all along, that it was faulty and could not be made to work.  After that, it was several more weeks before I received a replacement device.
The replacement was another model entirely, from the mp3 player I initially purchased.  It arrived yesterday, and I am already having problems with it.  I will not do business with SanDisk again.

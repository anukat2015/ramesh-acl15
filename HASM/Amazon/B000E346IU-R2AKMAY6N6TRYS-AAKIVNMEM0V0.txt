Title: An almost useless heater
Content:
I bought the heater to warm up a glass-enclosed porch this winter.  At even the highest settings, the heater gives off very little warmth, and then only within a few feet of the appliance.  The porch is small, about 12' x 6', so from reading other reviews, I expected the heater to be adequate for the space.  It isn't.  It is very quiet, but without warmth, that means little.

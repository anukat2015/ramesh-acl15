Title: Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Vacuum
Content:
I've had this vacuum for a couple weeks now and like it a lot. It has great suction power and does a very nice job. The tubes come apart nicely for changing the different heads and it's nice and quiet. It's also lightweight and easy to handle. And hooray! No more bags to buy.
On the not-so-convenient side: It has no way to set the height control of the brush. The manual just says that it automatically adjusts to the different rug heights. But, I find that it's too strong on my rugs and pulls the vacuum head forward with quite a bit of strength, as if it was on auto-pilot. When I try to vacuum the 6-foot strip rug it pulls it up so fiercely that I need two people: one to stand on the other side and hold it down and one to vacuum. This is with the suction set at the lowest setting. Ordinarily, I would adjust the roller height to be more gentle.
Because of it's light weight, the different attachments do not store in the main vacuum. So when you want to change to the crevice tool, you have to find it wherever you have it stored.

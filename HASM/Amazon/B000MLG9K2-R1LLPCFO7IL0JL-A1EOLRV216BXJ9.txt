Title: A pleasant surprise!
Content:
This is the first digital camera I have, replacing Nikon 8008 film camera. Of course I struggle whether I should get a D40x or D80. I am glad I finally decide on D80 for the following reasons:
(a) Larger viewfinder
(b) I get to use all my old AF lens (not for D40)
(c) The 2 monitors on D80 are not a nusiance, it is a plus. Changing ISO speed can be done using a simple button and displayed on the top  monitor, rather than at the back.
Of course D40x is a very lovely model. But here I see a lot of people buying the older version, cheaper but excellent quality,  AF lenses of fixed local length (e.g. Nikkor AF 50mm, micro 105 mm) to go with the D80 body with perfect auto focusing available. It saves a lot of money but the photo quality is superb.
Besides, D80 and D40x both have very bright LCD monitors at the back, easy-to-use buttons. I have bought my D80 for exactly 1 month today and have not stopped taking photos with it. The light very affordable 18-55mm and the 55-200 mm VR lenses are light and deliver sharp photos. Trust me, the photos even for those at 2.5 mega pixels after enlarging to 10"x12" are still clear and sharp. This camera totally exceeds my expectations!

Title: RAW files corrupted and autofocus does not work
Content:
I bought a 50D through Amazon.com in April, 2009. On the first one, the autofocus would not work at all. I spent about $35, for which I was never reimbursed, to send it back to Amazon.com. They sent me a replacement, which worked fine for about 6 months, then suddenly started producing corrupted, unreadable RAW files. I again spent about $35, but this time sent it back to Canon to be repaired under the 1-year warranty. They looked it over, supposedly found some problems of which I was not aware, fixed them, and then sent it back to me.  After being returned from Canon, the problem with corrupted RAW files was still not fixed.  This camera is getting ready to go back on a UPS truck for the 3rd time this year!
Advice to others:  next time Canon comes out with a new body, please wait at least 1 year before purchasing it.  Spend your money on "L" lenses or another brand instead of a higher-end camera body from Canon.  It is especially important to avoid something with quality control as poor as that of the 50D.  This many failures associated with only one unit is not a random problem, but strongly suggests a systemic problem.  In the past year, the price of the 50D has dropped about $200 while the price of a 70 - 200 F/2.8L has gone up about $100.  If I had known I was going to experience this many problems with this camera and only have photos marginally better than the XTi, I would have never ordered it in the first place.  If you're going with Canon, get the "L" lenses with a cheap body.

Title: You hardly know it's there..
Content:
Very small and quiet (audible but very easy to get used to and noise doesn't interfere with sleep) Perfect for a cold bedroom, made a huge difference. Excellent value. Compare the BTU output to much larger more costly units. There is only so much heat available on a standard 120 V home circuit and on the high setting this unit safely delivers it.

Title: Arrived in Poor, Possibly Reconditioned Condition
Content:
The retail box for this heater arrived with a giant gash in the side and a damaged corner; the shipping box is in perfect condition, so it wasn't damaged on the way here. I can overlook that, but the heater itself is completely filthy - covered in a thick layer of dirt, dust, and fingerprints, like it's been sitting in somebody's woodshop for a couple weeks. Also, some of the screws look stripped, which in addition to the above makes me wonder if this isn't "reconditioned" being passed off as "new". I haven't used the heater yet, but I wanted to warn others considering buying this... you might be getting a used heater.

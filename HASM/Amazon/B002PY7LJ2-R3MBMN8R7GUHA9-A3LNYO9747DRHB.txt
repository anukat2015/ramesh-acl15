Title: Great at first, followed by BAD problems
Content:
I purchased this laptop at the beginning of September 2009. I LOVED it at first. The size is perfect and the cute red color is an added bonus. I did not have any troubles at all. 
In December I started having problems. When opening the laptop when it is in sleep mode half of the time it will not 'wake' up and I have to power down. Also, while using the computer the screen just goes black and the machine shuts down. 
I understand it is a small computer and did not cost that much, however having these kinds of problems after less than 6 months from purchasing is NOT acceptable.

Title: Wonderful Camera
Content:
I love this camera!  I have owned the 20 D for some years now, and just hard the urge to upgrade.  I love to take pictures. For being an amateur I certainly take good quality pictures.  See the bride pictures I took with this camera with the Canon Speedlite 580 EX II Flash.  I got the flash specifically for my girlfriend's wedding.  The camera is fast and I couldn't be happier.  I will continue to invest in lens and continue to take pictures for as long as I live.
Thank you 17th Street Photo!!!

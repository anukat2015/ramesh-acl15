Title: sansa
Content:
It's a great gadget.    And I have got it to take music and pictures.  But  even with the sansa converter I can't get it to load short videos.
I know it will do it because one is loaded on it when I got it.
If anyone  can give good instructions for the process, please post it on a sansa review.
Thanks

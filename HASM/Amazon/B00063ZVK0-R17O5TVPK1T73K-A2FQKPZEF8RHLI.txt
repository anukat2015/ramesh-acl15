Title: Best bang for the buck
Content:
- Scored highest in Good Housekeeping tests. That alone was good enough for me to pick it..
I bought a heater for $25, $50 and returned both of them, because I had to stay close to get any heat at all. I was either getting too warm or too cold with my older heaters.
So I went ahead and spent 90$ (a small fortune:-) ) on this one. I am very glad I did !! It heates my room thoroughly. I dont have to sit in front of the heater to be warm. 
The vortex action really works.. it circulates air even into the corners of the room. At 90 bucks, it's money well spent.

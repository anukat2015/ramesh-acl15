Title: Cuisinart carafe-less coffee maker
Content:
We just purchased this coffee maker.  Very unique design in that it uses no carafe but a tank inside the coffee maker to store the brewed coffee.  You then press a lever to dispense the coffee.  My wife has a habit of breaking the glass carafes and so this should avoid this problem in the future. The plastic tank holds the brew basket as well as the coffee and both are removable for cleaning.  Full featured with LCD clock, auto start, and adjustable warming time.  The most expensive coffee maker we have ever bought but it is well built and most importantly it makes great coffee.

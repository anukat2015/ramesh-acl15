Title: 3.5 Stars....Very Basic and inexpensive MP3 player
Content:
I bought this unit mainly because of its price because there doesn't seem to be any 128mb MP3 player with an SD slot with a price less than this model.  Overall it is not a bad unit. Sound quality is average (although there is NO bass). It is lightweight and very easy to use.  The first unit that I bought has a factory defect where the USB port is improperly aligned so I cannot get the cable to connect.  As a result, I have not been able to try the products internal memory (I have only used the SD slot). Hopefully this was just an early production defect... I will exchange this unit and update this review if there are any problems or changes with the replacement.
*** Positive Points of the Irock EzMP3 model 930 include: ***
- Decent construction that seems like it will be able to take a beating.  Also it is very lightweight and small in size making it easy to carry.
- Rubberized plastic case that surprisingly feels nice and upscale.
- Battery compartment has a hinged cover so you don't have to worry about losing it.
- Decent battery life from a single AAA battery.
- Tech support was easy to reach and you get to talk to human and not a machine!!
*** Negative points include: ****
- Sound quality from the earphones is only average. There is no bass and there is no sound equalizer to adjust the music.  Also the earphones have the neckstrap integrated with them so if you buy better quality earphones you will not be able to use the neckstrap.
- There is no LCD screen and no battery level indication
- Will only play MP3's so you are out of luck if you have WMA or any other type of files
- instructions are very minimal, then again the unit is very simple to use so they cover the basics (although I still don't know what the green LED is for!!).
All in all this is not a bad MP3 player if you are looking for something that is durable and cheap... just don't expect 5 star sound or features!!!

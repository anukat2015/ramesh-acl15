Title: Excellent introduction camera
Content:
I bought this camera about 3 months ago and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I own a point and shoot camera as well (Sony W280) and got sick of the blurring and noise that you get at higher ISOs. So I decided to go with a DSLR. Not knowing what to purchase I just went with the two largest brands, Nikon and Canon and looked at the features and ended up going with the Rebel XSI due to the price at the time (it was on sale). Honestly though, this camera is amazing, being able to do high motion and low light shots with a high ISO without having the image look like you sprayed it with red dust confetti is awesome. I've recommended this to several of my friends who are going to get one as soon as they have the money to spend.
If you're considering a DSLR, I would seriously consider the XSI. I also recommend it for people just going into DSLR photography. It truly is an awesome unit.
The biggest issue I have with it though is the transferring of pictures through the given USB cord. I went on a safari with friends and took about 1300 pictures and while the pictures were gorgeous, just getting them onto my macbook via USB was a pain. Apparently it goes through all of the pictures on the camera then connects itself as a device on the machine.  My tip... use an external SD card reader. However, for small amounts of pictures, the USB transfer is fine.

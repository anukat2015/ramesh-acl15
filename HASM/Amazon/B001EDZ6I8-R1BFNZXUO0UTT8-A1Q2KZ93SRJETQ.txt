Title: Meh
Content:
I have been using the Vornado SoleAire for a couple of months now.  So far, it has been primarily used as a footrest.
Like all the other reviewers who have commented, Yes, it does smell when you turn it on, although the potency seems to go away with use.  When I first plugged it in, I was asking co-workers down the hall if they could smell it.
Second, it really doesn't get hot.  If you place your feet together in the top right part of the heater and keep them there for 15 minutes, they finally start to warm up.  It does not evenly displace heat, and the overall heat is minimal at best.
I wanted to love this product, and I don't even care about the smell, I just wanted it to warm my feet.

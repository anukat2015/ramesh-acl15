Title: Bagless Vacuum
Content:
I purchased this product after reading "rave" reviews about the efficiency and ease of the machine.  I will agree that the windtunnel is equipped with powerful suction, but I have a tri-level house and it is not an easy machine to use on stairs.  Unfortunately, the MAIN reason I bought this product is because so many people commented how easy it was for vacuuming stairs.  
The other down side to this product is that it is bagless.  I thought I would be OK with seeing my own dirt but it is rather disgusting to clean out.

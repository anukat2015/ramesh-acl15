Title: 30 GB Zune
Content:
Actually, I bought the brown one, but I have to say, the iPod killer is real.  So much more for the money and every bit as easy to use.  Not a single crash so far, unlike my previous iPod.  Apple may control this product market, but it's not based on quality or value - just being first to market and having no real competition early on.  Microsoft got it right with Zune in every way but the stupid name!

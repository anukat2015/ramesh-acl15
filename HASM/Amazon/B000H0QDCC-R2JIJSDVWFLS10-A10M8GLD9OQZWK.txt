This product is garbage! Even ask Microsoft as they published in the Chicago Tribune that they are not supporting this product. That would be why no one at Zune CS is willing to do anything to satisfy a Zune customer. They through it back at Amazon and Amazon is willing to take it back for 70% of what you paid for it. I lost $30 on Zunes website for downloads and now Amazon will stand to make $75. I would suggest IPOD for Sure! By the way their CS is not in the US...from the sounds of it. That's my opinion....

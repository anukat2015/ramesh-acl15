Title: Good Laptop for the price - Blue Ray + 4gb Ram+ 320gb hd +AMB Turion II 2.2ghz
Content:
I would start by saying , it was a good offer from Amazon. They shipped it in time. I am a happy customer of Amazon for the past many years. For a price under $ 600 , we cannot have another laptop with the same specs.
It has a good processor + 4GB Ram + 320gb Hard disk + Blueray player !! Its not super fast, but handles windows 7 pretty well.
There are 2 things I didnt like much about it though, the battery life is pretty short . I bought this laptop couple of days ago , the battery dies quickly . I am trying to charge it when the laptop is completely drained and shut down. Another feature which I didnt like is the touchpad , Its so hard to click on it.
Overall , I am Happy with the Laptop. I Give it a 5 star.

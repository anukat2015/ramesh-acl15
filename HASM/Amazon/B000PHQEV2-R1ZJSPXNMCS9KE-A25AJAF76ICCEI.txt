Title: Perfect for Newer/Younger Crowd or Companion Player
Content:
I currently own a 30gb Zen Vision M, and previously a 20gb Zen Touch, so I am a loyal Creative customer. When I heard about the Stone, I felt I couldn't pass it up, mostly for the price alone and how great it looks. I figured I will get a lot of use out of it for the times I'm in a hurry and want to get an album loaded quickly, or just don't feel like carrying the larger Vision around.
Nothing to complain about as far as functionality goes. Sound quality is as I would expect from a Creative player. I've so far used it mostly plugged into my car stereo and it sounds just as good as my hard-drive based player. The folder switch button is a plus, as it allows you to skip between folders/albums/however you care to organize. In my opinion it's nearly identical to the 12-cd changer in the back of my Jeep, but it holds more music and I can toss it in my pocket when I get out!
I don't mind the lack of a hold button, as there are only a few buttons that could really affect playback, and they are not as sensitive as other players. I do plan on purchasing either a skin or the keychain for it, just to give it a little extra protection.
This player is a great choice for a younger person or someone who is new to owning and managing an mp3 player, or, as in my case, as a companion to your player that already holds all of your music collection!
Hope you like my customer images posted for this product!

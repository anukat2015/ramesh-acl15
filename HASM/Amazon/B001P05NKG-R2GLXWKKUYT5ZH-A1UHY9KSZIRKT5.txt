Title: ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
Content:
I was looking to move from a 4 year old Dell laptop to an Apple (yeah, I know, all the headaches of moving Outlook data...I've used Macs at home and Windows at work for years).  I went with the 13" MacBook Pro for the weight and the backlit keyboard.  
This thing is fantastic! I can't ding it for a single thing.
AND -- using the iPhone, an MBOX converter and Google I was able to move almost all my Outlook data over without much hassle (I've done this before...).  I did need to re-key the Outlook tasks and export the journal entries to a CSV file for use. 
On the desk it works great with my Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse (get the MS driver software) and the desktop monitor.  On the road it is just fantastic!

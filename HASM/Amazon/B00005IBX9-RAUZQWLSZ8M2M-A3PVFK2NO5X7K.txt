Title: If you like good coffee, pass on this coffee maker
Content:
I had a Krups for almost 10 years before it all of a sudden died one morning.  I had to make a quick decision on a replacement and decided on this Cuisinart for 2 reasons - good ratings here and my local Peet's also sells this machine.  I'm a Peet's coffee drinker, so I figured how could I go wrong?  Well, this coffee maker just would not make a decent cup of coffee, or a decent carafe of coffee.  I like my coffee full-bodied and flavorful - like the coffee they make at Peet's.  I tried all sorts of things to get this coffee maker to produce good coffee, but in the end, I failed - or "IT" failed!  I even was putting in twice the amount of coffee I usually use in my attempts, but that didn't work; neither did pushing the 1-3 button.  So, after a month of trying I am selling this to a friend who's not as picky as I am.  I ordered a new Krups, even though the ratings were a lot worse, but it makes absolutely fabulous coffee!  Don't waste your time as I did - go straight to the Krups machines and buy the KM4065!

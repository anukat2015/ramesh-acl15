Title: I don't mind the kids fighting over it!
Content:
Finally here is a fight that I like to here from my kids....Who is going to vacuum! This is a great vacuum. It is quiet and very easy to use. I have tile and carpet and it goes from one to the other without a problem. My cleaning time is cut in half now. The kids love to use it too, now if I could just get my husband to try it. :) The only thing I don't like is having to clean the filter, but I got over that. My cousin just bought one after using mine.

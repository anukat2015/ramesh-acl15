Title: Not as great as hoped
Content:
The comments about the turn wheel are true, unlike previous editions, this one is not as sensitive.  Turning up the volume or down is often difficult.  Also, doesn't always advance when I press the >> button.  I also had to get it replaced for 'water' damage and the only water it was exposed to was sweat in my hands, luckily this was covered in apple's warranty.  Otherwise, i like it but i would not say that it is much of an improvement over earlier editions.

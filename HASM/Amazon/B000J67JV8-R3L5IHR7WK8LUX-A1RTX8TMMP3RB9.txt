Title: Fabulous Vacuum, Great Price!
Content:
My husband and I have had this vacuum for about 2 weeks now and I am absolutely pleased with it. I actually find that I WANT to vacuum with the Bissel Healthy Home because after buying 3 vacuums in the past year ranging in price from $40 to $100, this one, for the price of those three combines does an outstanding job. It gets ALL of the pet hair (we have two pomeranians) without clogging and I feel good about letting our baby play on the carpet now! It isn't my "job" to empty the compartment, but my husband says that it is easy to do. And the container is large too! I vacuum the living room/dining room area every day and the two bedrooms every other day or every three days and we have only had to empty it once, yesterday. I have used horrible vacuums, and the "top of the line" vacuums (living at home with my dad a few years ago he had a Dyson) and I think the Healthy Home is a cut above the rest. I think it is just as good as the Dyson for 1/2 the price! I would defiately recommend this to anyone and everyone!

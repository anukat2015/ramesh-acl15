Title: Great buy!
Content:
Fantastic product!  I have about 900 songs on my Sony.  It has replaced CDs in my car with its universal audio jack.  Well worth the money and just as good, if not better, than the I-pod.  Roughly an 8 hr. battery life, which is good, not great, but it charges in only 30 min. with your USB on the computer. Kudos to Sony on this one!

Title: Love this, but no dishwasher
Content:
I LOVE this little coffee maker since my husband doesn't drink coffee, I can just make one cup TO GO! However, the mugs/cups don't go in the dishwasher, hate that - but not enough to stop using it! (Update 12/09: STILL using these same two mugs after 3 years!!! I still love this since I am the only coffee drinker, but I have to say that I wish I would've purchased one of the bigger sets that can either house a karafe or travel mugs for when company comes over to the house)

Title: just what I wanted
Content:
I purchased the dirt devil to help with the inbetween cleaning.  I have 2 cats and a lot of little fur balls in the house.  This little vac has great power and does a great job.  The only negative is that it sometimes blows the hairballs away before I get them sucked up.  I like the style and it blends in well to the decor.

Title: Great vacuum, good price
Content:
This vacuum is good. Really, really good. It is pulling up dirt that my old vacuum never got out of the carpets. It may even be pulling up dirt from one floor down.
The bagless thing is good I guess, because you can always have a fresh clean chamber without going to buy new bags. But cleaning it out is a pain. Especially cleaning the filter which seems to hold more dirt than I ever thought possible. If convenience and not getting your hands dirty is a concern, buy the more expensive model with the self-cleaning filter.

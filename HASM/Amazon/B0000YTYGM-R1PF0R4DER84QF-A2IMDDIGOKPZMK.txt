Title: Only One Flaw and I Resolved It-Now I Like this machine!!
Content:
Several people have commented on the grounds and coffee spilling onto the counter during brewing.  This happened to me and it was because the filter housing unit popped open (it does not securely click in place when you close it). So I got one of my new black stretchy headbands out and put it on the top of the coffee maker to keep the filter unit from opening-no problem since.  This flaw is the only negative I have for this unit.  Otherwise, I like it and the thermal carafe does keep the coffee hot for a long time.  I have had the unit for over a year and no other problems noted.

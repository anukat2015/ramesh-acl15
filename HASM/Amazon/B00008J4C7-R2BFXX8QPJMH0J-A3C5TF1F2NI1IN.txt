Title: Love it!
Content:
I have gone thru tons of vacuum cleaners over the years....for the money you cannot beat this little powerhouse. It has super suction for this price. I have 6 dogs and one sheds alot. It even pics up hairs from the side by the mouldings along the floor. The only thing is that you have to empty the canister often. I have had this vacuum for two years and use it everyday. Last week from knocking it around constantly the wheels finally came off. No big deal I will order extras or just put felt on the bottom. I love this powerful vacuum. I never had any clog problems either. For 99 bucks the vacuum even has a built in heat sensor that will shut it down if the canister is too full. Just empty it, wait till it cools off and you are back in business again! This is a great little powerhouse vacuum for the price and I highly recommend it. You will be very happy.

Title: very good, but not perfect
Content:
This coffee pot works exactly as billed.  It is wonderful, though jarring, to wake up to the sound of the grinder grinding the beans and then the machine brewing fresh coffee.  I have two complaints: first, the grinder is factory set for medium grind, which means you don't get a very intense, fresh-ground coffee flavor so I end up using more beans than necessary to try to intensify the taste; second, the grinder base and lid must be cleaned immediately after every use, so overall it's much more labor intensive than a normal coffee maker.  But the convenience of it grinding the beans and depositing them in the filter for you and then brewing, all at your chosen programmed time is a super idea.  The Amazon price was $50 less than anywhere else, which is an added bonus.

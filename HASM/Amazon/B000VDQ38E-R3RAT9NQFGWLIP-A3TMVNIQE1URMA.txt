Title: Great Vacuum for the price
Content:
Let me start by saying that I am a new home owner. Before moving in a couple weeks ago I had a professional carpet cleaner come and clean all the rooms in my house. I had an old vacuum at my old place, so I thought I'd buy a new one for the new house. The day that this one arrived I put it together (it can look kind of like an intimidating task when you first pull the pieces out of the box, but it is actually a piece of cake) and did a once over on my living room. To my very big surprise the vacuum picked up a whole canister full of dirt and what I assume is leftover carpet cleaning powder from when the pros came. 
As of right now I like this vacuum very well and haven't had any issues. The two biggest complaints I've read on here is that it is heavy (for me it seems to be the weight of a normal vacuum) and also that the canister spills everywhere when you empty it (if you are careful when emptying it you won't have any problems).
I think it is a bargain at this price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good vacuum.

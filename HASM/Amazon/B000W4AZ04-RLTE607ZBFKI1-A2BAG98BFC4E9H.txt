Title: Best 4gb flash player.
Content:
You can't beat this product on features. It packs in much more than the equivalent Ipod that most people will end up buying before doing the research on other brands. You can just read product descriptions to find out the features.
I just want to point out the driving factor in my purchase. The feature that sold me on this player over all the others. The D-click interface is /ideal/ for exercise-use.
You can find the sides of an mp3 player easily, without looking, while bouncing around on the run, no problem. With the arm strap I can even navigate this thing using my chin with no trouble. I don't have to feel around for buttons or even look at it.

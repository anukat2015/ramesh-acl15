I almost didn't get this Apple because of the reviews about glare problems with the screen. I have glaucoma and have a major problem with glare. I am also using Lenovo and HP laptops and have had Dell and IBMs and the glare is no more of a problem than it is with them.It took a little while for me to get used to the changes in operating systems because this is the first time I ever used an Apple. It has been several weeks and I am impressed! It is smoother and a lot less glitchy. I really like how quiet and cool it runs. I didn't expect to take to it this much but I have. I doubt I will go back. It is worth the difference in price.

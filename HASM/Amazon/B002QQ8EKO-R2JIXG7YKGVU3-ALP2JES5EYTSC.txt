Title: decisions decisions...
Content:
First and foremost I love MAC. When i was younger my mom had a mac and i absolutely HATED it. After buying a windows HP last year and getting billions of stupid pop-ups, and having to search through 20 folders to find one thing, or programs closing for "unexpected reasons". I decided to switch. I personally think mac's are very simple to learn and once you learn all the ins and outs you'll wonder why you ever used windows. It reminds me of the iphone, how the App's are click and go. It is the same with the mac. I've debated getting the macbook and macbook pro, but for the price and the fact i won't be using it for games, i decided on the macbook. I currently own the macbook air and love it. I have zero problems with viruses, i never get pop-ups or random programs on my comp that i will never use. The Iphoto is awesome, and has a face recognition so you can create albums depending on whose in the picture, by place or by date. I also love IWORK, which i use to do all my homework for school, it saves in pdf. and .doc which is the most common. A random thing i noticed is the webcam is way clearer then other windows computers. Garage band is loved by many who love music and want to create ringtones or tracks. There is also Imovie for burning movies. the mac i use is only 1.6 ghz (speed) and  I can have 5 windows open and running and i never get an "unexpected error must close". So if you are daring enough to try something new, are tired of silly pop-ups, and stupid stuff that comes with your computer then this is the laptop for you.

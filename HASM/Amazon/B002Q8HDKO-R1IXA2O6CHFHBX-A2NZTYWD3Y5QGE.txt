Title: just what i needed
Content:
this has timer and the remote control that i needed.
i tend to leave the room often and the timer is from 30 min. up to 4 hrs. so i do not waste any electricity.
i think you can also leave it on as long as you needed by not pressing the timer button.
very warm with lower wattage setting.
no noise what so ever. 
it is a little bit confusing to use the controls in the beginning but figured it out in no time .
i have not used higher heat setting  because lower heat setting is enough for me ..
it does not look very sturdy so i  handle it carefully because i'd like to keep it working for a while.
i love it and so far no known complaint from me~

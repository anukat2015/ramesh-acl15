Title: Only does one thing...
Content:
... and that is make coffee, but it does it damned well.
I am not going to tell you the specifics of how a Bunn makes coffee; the previous reviewer did it very well and if you have ever eaten in a restaurant, doughnut shoppe, or coffee shop you have probably seen one.
I use the VP 17 in my home. You may ask why since this is really intended for commercial use. Well I have owned this unit for nearly four years without a hiccup. Grind the beans, pour the pre-measured amount of filtered (I made a mark with a permanent marker on the water jug) water and viola - the same identically made cup of coffee day after day in less than two minutes!!!
I mean I am drinking coffee in less time than most makers are just thinking about heating the water, and it is the same cup day after day after day. No surprises.
It does cost more than your usual home unit, but this thing is built like a Sherman Tank and if you actually needed it could produce enough coffee to take care of a small army. Four gallons an hour - can you imagine how long (like maybe days) it would take your average home coffee maker to brew that much coffee.
Like the other reviewer stated it is an extravagance but if you want to quickly and reliably brew your morning coffee it is a neat way to do it.
To sum it up a friend asked does it really make better coffee - to which I replied not only that but it looks damn COOL doing it. Makes a neat statement in addition to a great cup of joe.
P.S. I do home roast my beans and burr grind fresh every pot and man you have no idea how good a cup of coffee can taste. I know probably need to  get a life....but hey sometimes simple is good.

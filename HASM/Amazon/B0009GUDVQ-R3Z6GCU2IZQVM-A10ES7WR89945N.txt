Title: Good music but not enough features
Content:
Sound is great, nice device, but it lacks built-in features and accesories as the ipod has. For example, you cannot erase or edit a song without connecting the player to your PC; if you want to use a transmitter you will have to use a third party one (Belkin)which uses an ackward wire connection; the Sony speakers offered also use a wire connection and the sound is loud enough to use it in your bedroom or office but thats it. Next time I'll buy an ipod.

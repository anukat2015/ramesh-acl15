Title: Great machine, BUT read the manual if you want a great cup of coffee.
Content:
When all else fails.... read the instructions! 
1. The machine must be "primed" before using for the first time. MAKE sure you fill the water container AND only use the "ONE pod" holder (without a coffee pack). If you use the "TWO pod" holder, the machine will NOT prime. 
2. If you do not want "watery" coffee, MAKE sure you compress the coffee pods. Initially, I used two pods and did not compress them, and I was extremely disappointed. However, the next time I compressed them into the holder, selected the 7oz button, and WOW!... a really strong cup of coffee (7oz). Next time when I use two pods (and compress them), I will select the 9oz button. 
3. Save money (lots of it)- BUY the Presto model #09403 "MyPod" refillable coffee holder, add your own coffee, and REMEMBER... compress the coffee grounds. 
4. If the unit "Locks"... read the manual- it states how to Unlock the unit without having to break it.

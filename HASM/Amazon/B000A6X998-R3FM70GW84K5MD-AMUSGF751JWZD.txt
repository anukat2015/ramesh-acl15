Title: HOLMES tower works GREAT for parents!!
Content:
I purchased this heater for my parents who were keeping the heat turned down on the oil furnace due to high oil prices. Their fisrt months electric bill after starting the heater was only $1.00 more than the previous month!!! The house is warm and they use the heater ALL the time!! What a way to offset high fuel oil costs!!!

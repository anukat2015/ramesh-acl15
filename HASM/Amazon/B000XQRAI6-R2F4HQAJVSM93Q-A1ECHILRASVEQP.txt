Title: doesn't hold charge
Content:
I bought this b/c it was great value compared to the Ipod Clip and also had a display. 
PRO's
So far everything that I expected is great. Holds alot of songs, good reception, small and light weight, clips works wells.
CON's
- Ugly white headset and wire too short
- Doesn't hold a charge for the 15 hours as speced out. For some reason even when it's off it is still using power. 
- Trickly stop button. I accidentally press this and then my radio stopped. It took me a awhile to figure out why the radio wouldn't work. The stop button should only work for mp's and not for the radio which should be only off or on.

Title: Worked For 1 Season and Died
Content:
UPDATED REVIEW: This theater broke after 1 season. Not buying another DeLonghi. (Amazon won't let me downgrade my star rating either. Boo.)
OLD REVIEW: This heater does well for small spaces. It's fine for the bedroom, but doesn't do well if you're trying to heat a living room. Also, when you turn it off it doesn't hold heat at all, unlike the oil-filled version. We love the styling of this model, but wish it was oil filled like the other DeLonghi we have.

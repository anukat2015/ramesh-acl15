Title: Great heater, but no FAN-ONLY mode
Content:
Though the technical details (both here & on the manufacturer's site) refer to the existance of a fan-only mode (along with high & low heat), the unit actually does not have such a thing. Correspondance with Air King directly has confirmed this fact, by responding "I check [sic] with our engineers and this model does not have a fan only option."
Seems like a great heater though.

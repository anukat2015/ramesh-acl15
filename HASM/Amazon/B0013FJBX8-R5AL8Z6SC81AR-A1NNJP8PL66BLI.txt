Title: Exceptionally user-friendly, durable, reliable and sleek
Content:
This fine machine was the first Mac I have ever purchased after languishing for 20 years in the PC world.  The transition could not have been smoother.  All my computing tasks are handled seamlessly by the Mac OS, much more intuitively and with graphical flair.  Computing has become a true pleasure.
I'd encourage you to view the Macbook screen in direct comparison to the 15-inch Macbook Pro if you are contemplating the smaller size.  The 15-inch is so much more vibrant, has wonderfully functional backlit keyboard, and enables a much better viewing experience.
Super durable body, wonderful tactile feel on a quiet keyboard...I have yet to find a way in which this thing is in any way deficient.
Highly recommended!

Title: TVH500 is great for large rooms
Content:
This is a great heater for large rooms and rooms with vaulted ceilings. 
I purchased this heater for a home my family and I were flipping in Los Feliz. 
The house was basically a tear down and we rebuilt it from the ground up. Before we could have the central heating installed our real estate agents recommended a brokers open. We purchased two of these units to use during the initial open house. 
They worked great! The house had a large open space with 20 feet ceilings. I didn't think anything would get the room warm and even after we staged the house with furniture it would be still be cold. Luckily these Vornado heaters worked out great, and provided enough heat throughout the house. It worked especially well in mid October just when the cooler weather started to hit Southern California. 
We love the thermostat remotes, so it was consistently warm during operation. Plus, the fan is relatively quiet and isn't disturbing.

Title: montana hunting camp
Content:
I have a wall tent 14X26X5.  When we arrived in camp it was raining so hard all we could do was get the tent up and the rain fly on. The temperature was in the high 30's. We did not set up our stoves or cut wood because of the rain.  We fired up the Mr Heater and in no time the tent was warm.  It rained off and on for the next 7 days and we only used the Mr Heater for our heat for the tent.  I purchased my Mr Heater from Amazon.com used (refurbished) and it is excellent.  I am going to buy three more used when they come on to amazon.com as I have two other big tents in my hunting camp and a shower tent and they will all have a Mr. Heater in them for my hunters comfort.

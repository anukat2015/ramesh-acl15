Title: Upgrade to Canon EOS 50D Camera with EF 28-135mm Lens
Content:
I owned a Rebel XS and recently just upgraded to the 50D. I was about to only purchase the 28-135mm lens, but then I saw the lens is essentially half price if purchased with the 50D as a kit. I knew I would upgrade sooner or later, so I bought the kit and have not looked back. The extra features are worth every penny.
The 50D works and feels more advanced as it should, including the 28-135mm lens in comparison to the 18-55mm one. Both much sturdier, more sleek. The most notable differences are the jog wheel, which makes scrolling through pictures a breeze, and the 3.0" LCD = beautiful playback. I guess the only drawback is it's a bit heavier, but the trade-off is the added durability with more features packed within. 
The learning curve was a cinch having used the XS. If you're looking to upgrade from a lower model, the 50D is the logical next step. I almost went with the slightly less T1i, but after reading around the web, several others made it clear the 50D would be worth the extra investment. I'd have to agree.

Title: Twice wronged!!
Content:
I received this coffee pot for a birthday gift and thought it would solve all of my very early morning wishes- fresh, hot coffee the minute I rolled out of bed!  Well, after cleaning the myriad of pieces and parts, I found that I had to use twice as many beans as normal, since most of the grounds stayed in the basket. I adjusted - small inconvenience.  After 6 months it just stopped brewing, grinder worked but nothing else.  I returned it for a new one.  Four months later, same thing. I eMailed the company and no response. I give up - no more cuisinart products for me!

Title: Not for rooms greater than 350 square feet!
Content:
My family room is 22 x 17 and I purchased this unit for assistance with heating it in the winter.  I have 9 foot ceilings, which makes the room difficult to keep warm and cozy.  I purchased this unit because of the reference towards medium to large rooms, however, I can barely feel this heater in my family room.  However, when used in my bedroom (same size) with all doors closed, the room is nice and toasty! It's much better used in rooms that can be closed/isolated versus a larger room in a large home.

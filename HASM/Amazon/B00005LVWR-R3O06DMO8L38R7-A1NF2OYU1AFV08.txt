Title: Awesome time saver!
Content:
It's so great to be able to make my latte before I leave the house. I don't have to waste 15 minutes going to Starbucks (except when I'm low on beans.) A $10 bag will make many, many servings. Plus, this way I don't have to worry about it being too weak, as sometimes happens.
15 minutes three times a week, 51 weeks out of the year = 38.25 hrs. per year.

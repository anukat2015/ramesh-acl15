Title: Personal Heater Only
Content:
I use this heater in my home office which is exactly 108 sq. feet. After 3 hours continuous use the only warmth in the room is where the heater is directly pointed at (on me). In fact, since I work on my laptop I can't have the heater directly facing me, so only half my body is warm; the other half is freezing. My wife said that at her old job everybody had this exact same heater and they had it under their desk to warm their feet. I think that's exactly what this heater was made for.
It's very small (smaller than a human head) and fairly quiet (though I'm generally not bothered but these sort of white noises). A small problem is that on the high fan setting it tends to vibrate so much that it slowly moves out of position on its own. I have to wedge it between two heavy books to keep it pointed at me, or turn the fan down.
The biggest problem is that it uses far more electricity than I would expect from such a small device. The first time I plugged it into a socket and after a couple of minutes (while it got hotter) the breaker switched off. I have a 200 amp service and I run all sorts of large, energy hungry appliances all the time with no trouble, yet this little thing managed to throw the breaker. I have since plugged it into a power surge protector so if it happens again only the surge protector will turn off.
So many problems, so why the 3 stars? Because I'd be a fool really to expect more from a $20 heater. I'm just thankful it doesn't overheat after 10 minutes and switch off on its own like the last heater I bought.

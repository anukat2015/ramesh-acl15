Title: Great Dell laptop
Content:
Dell Inspiron 1545 15.6-Inch Jet Black Laptop - Up to 4 Hours 34 Minutes of Battery Life (Windows 7 Home Premium)
I subscribe to Consumer Report and when my sister (can't turn a computer on) was looking for a laptop for her son for Christmas I dug out the Consumer Report which listed the Dell laptop as a "Best Buy" it also listed shopping on line for the best price and recommended Amazon.com. Not being much smarter than my sister about computers I headed to Amazon.com and found the laptop. It actually had more features and good stuff than the one listed and it was also on sale. Great product, great price, and free shipping, who could ask for anything more?

Title: One chronic problem that will drive you nuts
Content:
When the Keurig machine functions properly, it's a great machine.  I own three of them, but I'm replacing them with the Breville unit.  The problem is that the Keurig machines constantly, and I mean constantly, go out of prime.  That means you'll put in your k-cup, press the button and ... it sits there.  Nothing happens.  Or you'll select a cup size and a fraction of that amount will dispense.  Workarounds include turning the machine on and off, lifting the handle up and back down, lifting off the water reservoir and putting it back on.  As I said, I own three of the machines and all of them manifest the same problem.  The workarounds usually eventually work, but at this price one would expect a more stable functioning machine.  I have had no such problems with the Breville, not once.

Title: This product is not refundable and not working
Content:
This product is not refundable, even in 10day from receiving it, which Amazon should clearly show it. Or are they all telling you a lie? AcePhotoDigital, vender and Sunpentown don't work for your return.  This is not working even in hot and dry area in Utah.  It is difficult to clean up and very noisy.

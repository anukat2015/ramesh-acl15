Title: Awesome D90
Content:
It's new, it's exciting and it's fun to use.  Matrix metering, center weighted metering and spot metering are all very good.  Autofocus works very well even with long telephoto lenses.  Works well with Nikon DX lenses as well as some of the older lenses I purchased for my film camera.  No complaints yet about this body.  Buy one and have some fun!

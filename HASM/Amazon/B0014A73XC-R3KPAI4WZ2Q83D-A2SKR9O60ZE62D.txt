Title: Not bad for simple use...
Content:
I picked this up as the Kitchen Laptop.. It's not bad for her MSN Games, Office 2007 runs like a champ and all running on Vista.. The laptop does get a bit warm on the palm rests.. Only two USB ports on the right side.. It does however have a slick remote that will pop in the express bay and it does have a HDMI out..
Cons:
Artist Design
2 USB Ports
All connections on the sides of the latops, none on the back. 
Pros
Everything else.

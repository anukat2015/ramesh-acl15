Title: Would not install unde the cabinet
Content:
I have had several of the old under the counter B & D coffee makers and have loved them.  This one was impossible to install, however.  On the coffee pot side of the unit there is no clearance for the screws.  What is up with that?  What engineering school drop out approved this design?  I had to return it. Why can't they just keep making the old one that fits in all the holes we have already drilled into our cabinets?

Title: Buyer beware!
Content:
Loved the mop, the results were great (no streaks).  It is tough to push but its really drying the floor.  However, it only worked 2x - won't dispense the fluid. Past 30 days so can't return or exchange and repair shop is 90 min away. I now use it to dry the floors, no bang for the buck here.  There are better steam mops, skip this one.

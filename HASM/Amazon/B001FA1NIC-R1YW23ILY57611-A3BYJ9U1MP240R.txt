Title: Not as good as the old 30GB I had
Content:
I purchased an 8 GB Nano. I had it for less than 30 days when the I pressed backward to listen to a portion of a book I was "reading". When I did the Nano reset itself, I lost my place in the book. And the Nano stopped working. I could not even turn it off. So I let the battery wear down and the nano reset itself when I started recharging it. At that point I would be listening to a book and press back and the book would switch to another. Amazon was EXCELLENT in replacing it. I received a new one in 2 days FREE. They gave me free shipping back also. So what started out to be a disaster turned out to be fine. I am still playing my books every day back and forth to work. I had read well over 100 books this way. First with my 30 GB Ipod, that was great and lasted years and finally the back seized. And that was the end.
 I would do the whole Nano thing over again.

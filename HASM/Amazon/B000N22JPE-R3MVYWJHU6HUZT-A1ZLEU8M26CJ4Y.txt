Title: A Step Up from Krups
Content:
When the carafe for my Krups broke, I looked at the replacement cost, which was close to $25.  Had the machine for several years, and it worked okay.  Once I searched Amazon and found I could get the Cuisinart for about twice the price of the replacement carafe, I decided to get it.
We're quite pleased with this coffeemaker.  It brews the coffee more efficiently - in fact we get a better, far more flavorful cup, and it uses less grounds.  It also has a feature for brewing 1-4 cups, where it heats the water twice, so you get a good hot brew.  Additionally, it has a light that goes on when you need to run a cleaning cycle.
While I don't find the water opening too small to be problematic, as some other reviewers indicated, it is smaller than our previous machine - and it would be better if it were larger.  With the shortie cords they put on these appliances, we don't have much room to pull it out from where it sits on a counter under some shelves, so it does take a little manipulation to position it right for adding the water.
I wouldn't let this stop me from highly recommending this coffeemaker, however.

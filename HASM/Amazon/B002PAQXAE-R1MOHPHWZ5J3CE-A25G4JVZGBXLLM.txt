Title: This little guy rocks!
Content:
I don't know if its windows 7 or the 2 gigs of RAM this thing comes with but man, it flies! And if that wasn't enough, I can cram 2 more gigs of RAM in there for good measure! 
I also love the Express Gate feature which allows you to boot in 8 seconds to get online, look at pix, listen to music, play games, use skype, mostly basic stuff, but its great to have.
I'm a big fan of Asus style cpus so i was very picky about what to buy in terms of body, and I love this one.  Chiclet keyboard with lots of function shortcuts,  brushed aluminum lid, very thin and light as the name would suggest.  I just wish they made this style with an optical drive, then it would be heaven!
Battery life seems decent; I get about 3 1/2 to 4 hours depending on what I'm doing (mostly web surfing), and there is a secondary power button (used to launch Express Gate) that can switch on battery saving profiles to dim the screen, etc.
I love this cpu but there is a UL30 model which gets much better battery life than mine (up to 8 hours, I think) but I don't know of any other differences. Check them both out!

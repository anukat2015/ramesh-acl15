Title: Disappointed
Content:
If I had written this review within a few months of my purchase I would have rated it 4 / 5 stars. It had some minor issues but nothing that I couldn't deal with. I liked the size as I travel for my job and I would take it along with my work laptop. 
I purchased the laptop in late Nov. '07 and in early Jan. '08 it stopped booting up. I was pretty sure it was the motherboard and after reading about many other people with the same issue on various web sites it helped confirm my thinking. 
Due to the large number of people with similar issues with the tx1000 models I felt compelled to write this review. I'm not sure I will be buying any HP laptops / desktops any time soon.

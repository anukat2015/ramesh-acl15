Title: A Super Sucker with ony minor drawbacks
Content:
I have never done a review of an item before but but I spent so much time researching this vacuum cleaner purchase that I decided to.  The other reviews were very helpful so I wanted to give something back. Please understand this review covers the machines ergonomics and functional aspects. Since the machine is new in our home I can not address how well the vacuum will perform after extended periods. First let me say that this purchase came after a lot of research. I compared most brands on the market and and narrowed the field to the hoover and the Dyson. After a trip to the local store I ruled out the Dyson due to its cumbersome design, high price and the series of steps necessary to use the wand and accessories. What a pain!. In addition the beater brush area is very high on Dyson the and would be very difficult to get under furniture and cabinets. Now that said, let it be know that my wife if a vacaholic. The vacuum runs every day in this house. For the last several years we have used a $400 Panasonic machine and we thought it was doing a good job. We were wrong! A first cleaning with this new hoover has returned several cups of dust and dirt from EACH room!!.  Really!.This hoover finds dirt that the Panasonic didn't know existed!. The beater bar is very aggressive it will actually pull the head along if you don't restrain it. At this point I think I will just list the pros and cons as that is easier for the reader. The Pros far out weigh the cons on this machine and I think with a few simple changes hover will have the ultimate machine in this line. We are very pleased.

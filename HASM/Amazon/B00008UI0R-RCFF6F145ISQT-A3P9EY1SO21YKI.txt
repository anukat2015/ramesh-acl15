Title: A++++++++++++ Vacuum
Content:
I received this vacuum today - put it together quickly and easily and took off.  I couldn't believe how much dog and cat hair my previous bagless vacuum was missing.  This vacuum is awesome and a breeze to use.  After reading the instructions on how to clean the filter, which is also very easy, this vacuum should last a long time.  Also, I ordered the vacuum with the free shipping and it only took 5 days for it arrive.  Very pleased with Amazon.

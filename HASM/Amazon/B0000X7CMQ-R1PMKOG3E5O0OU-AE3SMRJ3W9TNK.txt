Title: Works great...poor taste
Content:
I was very excited with my new coffee maker initially.
Great features, easy to use, nice looking etc.  I'm very
disappointed with the taste of the coffee.  I spent a month trying different brands of coffee, various grinds and several different water/coffee combinations with no success.  It basically makes a lousy tasting cup of coffee.  Very little flavor and it has a "bite" to it.  I'm very disappointed
with the flavor.

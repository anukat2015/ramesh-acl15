Title: Fantastic Camera for the More Advanced Photographer
Content:
I have been wanting this camera for several months, and I was finally given one for Christmas by my parents. I have to say that I have truly enjoyed this camera. It is easy to use, and the image quality is amazing. The only downside would be the video, but I don't use that feature very often, so not a big deal in my opinion.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
Very easy to use - usually takes great shots.  Has a ton of modes - my only wish is that I could pick and choose the features I want to build my own custom shooting setup.  For example, to use RAW mode you can't be in any basic modes - but auto-flash only works in the basic modes.

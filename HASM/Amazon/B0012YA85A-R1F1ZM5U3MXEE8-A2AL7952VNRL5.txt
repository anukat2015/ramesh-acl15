Title: cool beans
Content:
very nice dslr. Huge difference from a conventional dig. camera.  So far the photos that we have shot are very viverant and sharp.  i still use kodak image editor though because of my printer.  very nice camera.  this does not take short movie clips, kinda weak considering all the other cameras at this price point do.

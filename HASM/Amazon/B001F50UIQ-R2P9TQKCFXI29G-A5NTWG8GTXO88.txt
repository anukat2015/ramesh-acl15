Title: plain and simple, just what i wanted
Content:
I wanted a simple to use mp3 player that compatable with windows media player that I already had, that would play the playlists that I already made, and thats what this is. I plug it in and the player shows up in WMP below the library. I drag playlists into it, hit copy, and it pulls all the songs from the locations so I dont have to find it and copy one at a time! It is a good size, small but not too small to use, and thin but doesnt appear fragile (I dont like superthin devices). The earphones were the hard plastic kind that always fall out of my ears, but the sound quality is good if you dont mind those kind.

Title: This thing really sucks!
Content:
This thing really sucks ,and that's a GOOD thing.It sucks up dirt ,dog hair,lint,everything you don't want on your floors.It's easy to empty and doesn't use any bags. I would recomend this machine to anyone that wants clean floors,and doesn't want to buy alot of bags.

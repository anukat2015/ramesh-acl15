Title: I love this heater!
Content:
I received my heater today and I just love it!  It has easy controls and I can move the direction of the air flow.  Most important: I am so warm!  Even my dogs are cuddled up by the heater.  I had just returned some other heaters because they just didn't help.  I am so relieved that this unit is so terrific.  I love it when a plan comes together.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
I moved up from the Rebel XT which I had used for over 2 years.
The EOS 40D has a much bigger and brighter viewfinder, is built better and feels much more substanyial in your hands. The 40D is extremely responsive. It focuses faster and more accurately than the Rebel. The menus are more comprehensive and everything has been well sorted out. The live view option is wonderful for macro work. So far, no complaints at all.

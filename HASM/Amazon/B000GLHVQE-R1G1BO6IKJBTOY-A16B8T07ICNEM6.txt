Title: Great Ambiance & Kicks Heat Out!!!
Content:
I was hesitant to buy this as I always wanted a real, wood stove for my master bedroom. I bought this since it was not too small and not too big for my room. I wanted the "flame view" on those rainy nights and also something to heat up my bedroom. I first plugged it in and I love the fact you can turn on only the "flame" without the heat, great for snuggly nights. Also the 2 seperate heat levels. I set it on high and about 15 min later I could feel the heat coming out from the bottom. I was worried at first about the heat close to the floor and carpet, but I felt the carpet after 1 hr. and it was not as hot as I thought it would be. Great all around heater, very pleased, very sturdy, top does not get hot (I placed photo frames on it" I wish I would have purchased the larger one now! It's worth the money and looks great.

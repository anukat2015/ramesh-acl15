Title: DON'T BUY THIS!
Content:
I bought three of these in one order.  
One of them arrived with "air bubbles" under the paint.  I returned that immediately.  
Another looked suspiciously refubished -- the box looked as if it had been previously been open.  Each time I turned it on, it wouldn't heat up, until one day there was a thin film of smoke and sparks coming from the unit.  I sent it in for repair and after waiting a couple of weeks with no word on its status, I followed up with the authorized repair center.  They said they were still awaiting parts from Delonghi, that Delonghi never returned their call, and that they will probably ship my heater to Delonghi. So that one is still pending!   
The third one works fine.  But as one of the customers mentioned earlier, sometimes it turns off on its own and it needs to get stone cold before it will fire up again.

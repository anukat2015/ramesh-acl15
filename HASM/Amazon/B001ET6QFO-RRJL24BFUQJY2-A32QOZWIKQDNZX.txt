Title: Great camera! The best in its class.
Content:
I never was a "Canon's man" not because I kept something against the brand, but the controls layout, some other things were not in the way I was used to. They are still different to me but the overall image quality, handling and general photographic capacity is tremendous. For the price given it is best buy. I had K20D and liked it a lot, but  the ugly color noise clearly visible even on ISO400 started to be irritating. Another thing is the focusing. This cam focuses fast and quiet, not to mention its unbelievable 6.5 fps. 
Some cameras become legends and high points of achievement and it feels like this one is such a cam.
As to me there's no reason for a higher pixel count, because it allows printing for practically any size that photo printers allow with pixel-to-pixel precision. I also had my hands on Sony A900 that is terrific camera in every way but it is much pricey and I already prefer smaller sizes and weights that associated with 24x16mm sensors. 
This camera married with Canon's terrific 17-55 2.8 zoom produces images of stupendous quality.
I don't shoot much of action photography but overall responsiveness, instant readiness of this camera is very satisfying. The fast focus is delightfully silent with exactly this amount of feedback that feels just right. The battery life is very impressive as well. 
Very nice camera, highly recommended.

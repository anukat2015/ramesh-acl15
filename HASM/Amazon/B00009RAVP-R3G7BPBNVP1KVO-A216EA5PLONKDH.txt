Title: Absolutely Fantastic!!!!
Content:
I LOVE this heater. I received it as a gift nearly two years ago and it's still working great. I live in a one bedroom apartment in rainy Portland, Oregon and it's gets cold! So many times I've come home cold and wet and this thing makes me feel a million times better in no time at all. It's very quiet (I hate noisy heaters) and it's small, so I can easily bring it with me if I move to another room. It's instantly warming and I love the light. I spend a lot of time at my desk in one part of the house and I keep this heater nearby to keep me warm instead of keeping the electric heat running throughout the house all day. If you want something you can tote around the house with you, you like a warm, orange glow and you want inexpensive heat instantly, BUY THIS!!

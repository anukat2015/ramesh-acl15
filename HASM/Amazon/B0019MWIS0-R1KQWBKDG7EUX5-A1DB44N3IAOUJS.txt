Title: NewAir AF-350 Swamp Cooler Does What It's Supposed To
Content:
My parents live in Arizona and they constantly complain about the dry heat in the summer.  I bought this evaporative swamp cooler for them hoping that it would work (these air coolers aren't really useful for areas with high humidity, but they're supposedly fabulous for really dry places).  I had it shipped to my parents and they have been raving about it ever since.  It's pretty compact, works really well, and is obviously way less expensive to operate than their central air conditioner.  Would definitely recommend this product to others.

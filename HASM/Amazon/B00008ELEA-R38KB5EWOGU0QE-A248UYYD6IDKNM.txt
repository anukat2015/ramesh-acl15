Title: Licensed products not the same quality you remember
Content:
I've owned two of these. Each only lasted about two years. I expected more from Farberware. One of the reasons I started buying these percolators is because my mother-in-law has had the same one for 20 years. It still outdid my newer ones in terms of performance and they both broke. So I did a little research. This model is built in China by a company that's not Farberware. That company bought the name Farberware and uses it to sell products. The old Farberware you remember built products in the Bronx. They were built to last. After finding this out, I decided to find a used Farberware percolator from the old company. I found one on a leading online auction web site and purchased it for $20 (shipping included). It has been everything I thought it would be and more. Beware the brand names. Know who really makes that product before you buy. You'll be happy you did.

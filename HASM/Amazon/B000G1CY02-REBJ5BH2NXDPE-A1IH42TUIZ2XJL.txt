Title: Sleek panel heater that works very well
Content:
I bought three of these heaters for chilly places in our forced air heated house.  The heaters take up very little space, can be wheeled and repositioned and really supply good heat. Amazon's price was by far the best of any Internet site or bricks & mortar store.  A great combination of esthetics and functionality.  This model was highly rated in my Consumer's magazine and I bought the units because they are energy efficient.

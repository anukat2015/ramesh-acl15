Title: The best quality for the least money of any professional camera
Content:
I have owned the  S-2 S-3 and have now owned the S-5 since it was released, I think in 2006. The colors,dynamic range and tonality were far Superior to any pro camera that would cost twice the money and still they lagged behind the quality curve( the S-5 is not a fast camera). I have since bought and sold a Nixon D200 that really disappointed me. 
 When I have to take only one camera I leave the Canon D40 at home and take the Fuji S-5. 
The saddest time in digital photography came when Fuji decided to not continue in the Pro Digital market. If Nikon had had some smart leadership they would have had Fuji develop sensor technology for them.
 Its a shame to see one of the finest engineering teams just working on Prosumer product lines. I will always be a Fuji advocate even though they no longer support the Fuji S-5.

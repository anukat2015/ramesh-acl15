Title: Awesome!! except....
Content:
This is really awesome, i've never had an ipod before, so if there are any features that were available on previous ipods that are not included in this ipod, i am not aware of them. 
included with the ipod are:
  Ipod nano
  
  itunes and ipod insataller software
  
  USB cord to connect and charge the ipod
  
  earbuds (headphones)
  
  ipod nano dock converter, to change universal docks to ipod nano docks
  thin gray protector case. I would reccomend getting another case to really protect the ipod, that you can use while playing the ipod
   instructions
sadly the ipod nano does not include a charger that you can plug into the wall...the main reason for me giving the ipod 4 stars. in order to charge the ipod, you must leave the ipod plugged into your computer through the USB port, with the computer on which ends up staying on all night in order to just charge an ipod...a waste of energy if you ask me. if you havn't heard it enough the screen gets scratched really easily. 
If you can, order the ipod through apple.com, because they will engrave it for free.

Title: Great camera for a great price!
Content:
I am a beginning DSLR user and bought this camera at the beginning of September, 2008. Since then, I have literally taken thousands of photos. Some are great, most are not, but I'm learning as I go. Before this, I used an older point and shoot. While I have no basis for comparison, I believe this to be a very fine camera. It's user-friendly, takes great photos, has a very fast start up, and is relatively easy to find accessories for. I would recommend this camera to any DSLR user of any experience.

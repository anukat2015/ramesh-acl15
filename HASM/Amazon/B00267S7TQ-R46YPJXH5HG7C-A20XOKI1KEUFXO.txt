Title: Serious reliability problems
Content:
When I got this camera, I was thrilled. It was light, easy to use, and took great pictures. I missed the top LCD that my D70 had, but it was mostly great.
Just recently, after about six months of ownership, but only maybe 20 or 30 days of use, the camera broke. Well, not broke exactly. It still takes pictures, but the mirror seems to be locked up or something. When you look through the viewfinder, you see what looks like a focusing screen with the blurry out of focus image and several focus points clear. It takes clear pictures, but is unuseable because you basically can't see what you're pointing at.
I discovered this problem the day before a three week trip to Australia. My local camera guy says this is a common problem with the D3000 and D5000.
I live overseas. I can't bring back the camera. I'll have it repaired when I get a chance to return it in the U.S. (this warranty is not international). 
But the damage is done. I won't be buying another Nikon. I'd only bought this camera over the Canon d500 (Ti1) because of my previous investment in lenses, etc. (turns out you can't use lenses from the D70 in auto-focus anyway).
When I get my camera repaired, I'll use it and probably take reasonable pictures with it until it possibly breaks again. But I won't be investing in any more lenses, etc. My next camera will be a Canon.

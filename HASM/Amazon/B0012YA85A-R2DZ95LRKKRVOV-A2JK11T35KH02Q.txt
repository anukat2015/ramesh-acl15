Title: A fine machine
Content:
I have been looking at digital SLR's for some time now. I have always liked the feel of the Canon bodies, and the XSi feels like it was built for my hand.
It is a complex beast, but fortunately the auto mode gets you started with decent shots right away. I'm a seasoned user of SLR's, but any new model takes some practice.
Although the 18-55mm lens is OK, don't waste your time with it for professional quality photos; it will get you started but bite the bullet and get a decent long lens. (I got the EF 70-200 from Amazon -- a bit steep in price but makes the XSi perform like a different camera.)
The software furnished with the camera is a good start, too, until you decide what kind of "darkroom" you want to build.

Title: Makes good coffee -- keeps it hot.
Content:
We love coffee.  Right now I think we have at least five different varieties of french roast coffees and three of coffee with chicory (most from Orleans Coffee in New orleans) in our freezer.  And we have tried many types of coffeemaker to prepare it.  What we have found has worked best is the combination of a fine grind, a high water temperature, and a good thermal carafe that does not burn the coffee after it has been brewed.  Thie Zojirushi was the top rated thermal by Consumer Reports so we thought we'd give it a try.  It makes great coffee, very hot,  and keeps it hot for three to four hours even in the winter.  Also, because of the high temperature, You need to use less coffee.  For people who disdain dark or french roasts as being too strong, take note that the darker the roast the less the caffeine -- the roasting burns off the caffeine, so it's richer tasting and you can drink more!

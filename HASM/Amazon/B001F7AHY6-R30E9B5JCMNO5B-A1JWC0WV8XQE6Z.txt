Title: Ipod 160GB Classic model
Content:
I LOVE my new Ipod.  I have so much music and finally it all fits in one small compact device.  I-tunes is also awsome.  I am so glad I broke down and finally ordered an ipod.  The classic is the best.  You pay so much more for the touch devices and there is so much LESS room.  This classic ipod was the perfect device for me and it works well, sounds good and is excellent.

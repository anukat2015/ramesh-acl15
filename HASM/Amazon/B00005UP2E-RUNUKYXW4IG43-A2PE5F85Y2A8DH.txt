Title: Best for tiled floors
Content:
I bought this vacuum for my saltillo (sp?) , slate and wood floors.  The shoulder strap makes it too easy to tote from room to room in my 3,000 sq. ft. plus house.  The accessories are readily available on the handle and easy to switch out during the process.  I am very happy with my &quot;Breeze&quot; and strongly recommend it for homes without carpet.

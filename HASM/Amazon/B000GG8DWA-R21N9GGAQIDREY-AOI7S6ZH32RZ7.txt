Title: Just ok
Content:
I purchased this heater as it was a small size that I hoped could be easily moved from room to room.  The size is ok but when you pick it up by the handle it doesn't seem very secure.  The control dial is also difficult to see what setting it is on.  It does heat up fast and provides the right amount of radiant heat.

Title: it won't roast marshmallows, but will keep you warm
Content:
this little heater is a sweet and functional item that all the pets want to curl up in front of. It really adds a lot to the room and only costs about 11-15 cents an hour to operate. It keeps 500 sq feet nice and cozy. I plan to buy another.

Normally my energy bill is about $100.00 a month during the winter here in the very deep south however, after four extreme cold snaps I was using my central heating unit and the monthly charge that I received from the energy company, to be paid in January,  was $237.87.  I was shocked, and so I called the energy company and asked about the huge increase, and they told me that the it was due to constant usage of the central heating system.  I tried to get a space heater from two of the largest chain stores that sell that type of thing, but because of the extreme cold weather, they were sold out.  I looked on the Amazon website, read reviews and picked out a space heater, the Lasko 755320.  I was so happy that Amazon had a free shipping promotion at the time. It arrived in about 5 days, I opened the box, read the instructions and plugged it in.  I was happily surprised by the low noise level that the heater produced.  The best part, though, was when my energy bill arrived, to be paid in February, it went down to $127.00.  We're still having cold weather, this morning it's  in the high 30's, this is actually the fifth cold spell, and I've used this item everyday since it arrived, and I'm very happy that I chose this product, it looks good, it is quiet and easy to use, it has many safety features, including a remote.  I only regret that I didn't do it sooner.

Title: HATE IT! Sucks hair but not dust/dirt!
Content:
I received this vacuum as a wedding gift about a year ago. I only have one, rather small, room in my house that has carpet; but I do have one really long haired cat that drops hair all the time! I registered for this vacuum for that reason. I have only used it a handful of times because it throws dust so dang bad. When we first moved into our house, the carpet had just been cleaned. So I didn't notice right off that this vacuum was going to be so bad,  or I would have immediately returned it to the store. I have taken it to a vacuum service store, and they put a new belt on it, cleaned it out, and really didn't see that anything was wrong with it. Brought it back home, and still the same thing! As soon as I turned it on, dust blowing all around it. The vacuum itself had been wiped off and cleaned up when I got it, and after using it for just a couple of minutes it was COVERED in dust yet again and I was coughing and hacking from all the dust in the air. It does have suction, because I can see a few lint and hair balls spinning in the container- so I know that it is "working". I have never been so dissappointed in anything in my life-- At least not that I can remember!! I have asthma and allergies, and I am stuck with a newer vacuum, that to me, is a complete piece of junk and hazardous to my health. I does suck up hair, but it just blows the dust and dirt! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, allergies or not. I will most definitely be looking for something else so I can hopefully just vacuum my one room and move on with life-- still being able to breath and not having to go over all the furiture with a dust rag!!!

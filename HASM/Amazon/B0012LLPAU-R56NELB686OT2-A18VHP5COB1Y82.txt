Title: Works great
Content:
This heater works great! I have 2 in my home, and they run only as needed. They key is to not put the thermostat sensor (little grate below the back filter) in areas that don't change temperature along with the rest of the room. If yours heats too long and then not enough, you probably have it up against something. Mine cycles great, I move it from my home office during the day to my bedroom at right. My dog sleeps in front of it, and my wife and I couldn't be more comfortable. I played with the delayed start, and it looks like you have to turn the unit off to set it. It's not a timer, it's delayed start. It tells the heater how long to wait before turning on so it won't keep running if you'll be gone for the day. Obviously if you try to make it do things it was never designed to do, you'll be frustrated. The owner's manual explains it pretty clearly.

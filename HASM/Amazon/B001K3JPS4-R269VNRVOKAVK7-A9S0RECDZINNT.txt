Title: A Fine Camera
Content:
I own the Olympus E-510 and previously purchased the E-3. I sold the E-3 because I found it too heavy to carry all day in the wetlands photographing birds. The E-30 has excellent image quality, auto focusing, ease of use and is just the right weight and ergonomic fit for me. I find the E-30 extremely intuitive to use. I would have liked the body to be weather sealed like the E-3 but that would have made it too heavy. All in all, the camera is a joy to use and I would recommend it (and have) to anyone wanting a quality product at a fair price from Amazon.

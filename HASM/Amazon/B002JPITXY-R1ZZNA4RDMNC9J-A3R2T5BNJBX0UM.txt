Title: Great player!
Content:
I just picked one of these up with the hd dock. It works very well! The video quality is awesome (hd) on my hdtv and the sound quality is good. The player has a great touchscreen and nice colors from the OLEDs. i would suggest getting a dock. Can't wait for an SDK to come out for this thing and watch as the marketplace grows. Also will be interesting to see the 3d games which will come out soon and how it works with the xbox360. They should really make a zune phone just like this... 
ps.. The zune marketplace is awesome. I think the zune software is awesome. Gorgeous design and I can download as much as I want for 15/month and keep 10 of those songs. 
Good overall deal..

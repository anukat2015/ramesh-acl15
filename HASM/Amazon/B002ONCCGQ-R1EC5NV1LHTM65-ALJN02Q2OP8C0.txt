Title: Worst laptop ever
Content:
My husband bought me this laptop in November to replace my 6 year old iBook.  What a mistake.  The mousepad is crap--it's impossible to use and jumps around and closes windows at the slightest touch.  2 weeks ago the battery died for no reason.  It won't charge and the computer shuts down the second I unplug it.  I will NEVER EVER use another HP laptop again.  This is still under warranty but I just wish I could return it and never see it again.

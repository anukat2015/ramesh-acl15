Title: Easy for a Middle Aged person!
Content:
If you know what an 8 track tape player is or still have 8 tracks you need one of these! this is a neat little unit, the FM radio is great and since I was around when FM first started out it makes it even better, you can put on all your oldies and then the kids tell you to turn it down! I'm glad I own this little gem.

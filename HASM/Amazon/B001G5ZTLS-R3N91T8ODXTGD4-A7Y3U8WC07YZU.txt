Title: worthy upgrade
Content:
I have changed cameras through the following order
300D
350D
20D
30D
40D
and now 5D mark II
I love the 5D, and its better than the previous 5D in price (when it was launched) and much richer in features and advancements.
I won't go too technical, you can check many websites for that.

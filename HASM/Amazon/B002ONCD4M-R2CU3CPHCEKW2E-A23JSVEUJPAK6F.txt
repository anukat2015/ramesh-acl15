Title: Design
Content:
No complaints about functionality.  Good power, stripped down preloaded software (buy your own Wordperfect, Office, etc.), good battery life.  There's a design deficit: the battery pack is external, mounting lengthwise under the hinge.  It protrudes considerably from the flat surface of the bottom, raising the laptop's back permanently.  I.e., this laptop cannot lie flat.  An aggravating feature is that the top/screen does not open all the way back -- it stops at about 120 d.  The combination of external battery and limited screen swing is OK working at a desk, but it makes it difficult to work sitting with the laptop in your lap (easy chair, airplane seat, bed, etc.) when you may want the screen more open.  The battery and screen angle forces me to tilt-up the keyboard in order to get the screen back far enough to view comfortably.  I would not have bought this laptop had I been aware of that, as I typically use it w/o a desk.  Finally, those ridiculous bubble drawings that HP has ink-screened around the keyboard of this series are butt-ugly.

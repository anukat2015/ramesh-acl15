Title: The little heater I was looking for
Content:
This is the inexpensive heater I've been looking for.  (1) It's fairly compact (9-1/2 w x 7 d x 10 h) and because it's curved instead of boxy it seems smaller.  (2) An unexpected bonus, finally a cord that's realistically long - 6-1/2 feet - so I won't need an extension cord.  (3) The thermostat works reasonably well, in terms of sort of maintaining the temperature - something I wondered about in a cheap heater.  Though the right setting and how well it works will probably depend on where it is (floor, countertop).  And the thermostat probably can't be expected to work well in an especially drafty location.
As others have noted - It's quiet (though not silent).  There are two heat settings, though as noted just one fan setting.  The numbers on the dials are hard to read except up close.

Title: mixed feelings
Content:
I wanted (and expected) to love my new acer timeline. After much research (and good reviews) I went for it. It was about time I get a new machine after a few years with a reliable no frills but good IBM T42. Ive been using my new toy for a week now, here my mains pros and cons:
My likes: 
1.- Battery, battery, battery: like everybody says, it runs for about 6 1/2 hours mostly surfing the web, no more runs and rush to plugin
2.- Good performace & speed: I knew this was not the fastest on the mmarket, definitely an improvement from my old machine, everything much faster (windows 7 loading still needs speed improvement)
Cons: 
1.- 1366x768 over this 14 inches wide screen: everything is too small, I dont wear or need glasses but my vision is not happy here...very annoying, I may change this machine soon if I dont get used to...  
2.- speakers: Im not talking about music or movies, havent even tried them, but even with skype volume I have to put volume to 100% just to get an ok sound. bad, bad... 
For the rest, I waited for windows 7 and skipped vista, Im not thrilled with 7, its ok, will see (looks like vista though).
Not much else to mention , sure machine is thin and lighter than 14 inches, decently quiet, nice and quiet keyboar, ok touchpad (responsive but have seen better ones). Ultimately, I have moments of love&hate with my new machine, I would probably get aa different one if I had to choose again, if cons that I mentioned are too important to you go get another machine...

Title: Excellent Buy
Content:
This heater/unit is excellent. The remote control is just an added feature to this great model. We've been using the fan function recently, but have turned the heater on a couple of times for those cool fall nights. We are using this in about a 1200 square foot area of our basement, and its keeps the entire room very comfortable. We struggled with heaters last winter, and I have to say this is by far the best. We did the oil heaters, and they couldn't even get the room temp above 65 after 4 hours of the unit running. This ceramic heater has managed to get the temp up in just 30 minutes of use.  I highly suggest this heater as a good one to buy.

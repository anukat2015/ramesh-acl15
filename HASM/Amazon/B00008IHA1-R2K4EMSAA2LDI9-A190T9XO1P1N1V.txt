Title: PIECE OF JUNK - DO NOT BUY
Content:
I am so disappointed with this coffee maker. I was in the market for a large capacity maker and read all the reviews. I bought this one based on MANY positive reviews and it was a bonus that it was so cheap. In fact, I questioned its quality based on price and I was right. You get what you pay for.
I brewed my first batch and knew it was junk. The coffee tasted of metal.  But I figured maybe it was only the first use so I would try again. I meticulously followed the cleaning instructions and despite that, I got calcification / mineral deposits in the urn after one use.  I don't throw ANYTHING away.  I will begrudgingly throw this out.
I rely heavily on amazon reviewers and have never written one...this waste of time and money has compelled me to save others from the mistake I made.

Title: THIS THING IS THE REAL DEAL.
Content:
Unlike many of the other vacuums on the market which are made of cheap plastic and designed to last only a couple of years, this vacuum is very well engineered and put together.  They use much better polymers in their parts and the whole thing is clearly well built.  It's more expensive than others but worth every penny.  I actually like vacuuming now!  It's sooooo quiet compared to others I've heard and the sound it does make is much more pleasing that the high pitched noise usually heard. What an improvement from the $500 Electrolux we used to have.  I can actually hear the stereo playing now when I work.  
One of the best features of this vac is the head for hard floors.  It has a ball joint on it that allows you to control the head as if it were your own hand at the end of the wand.  You've really got to try it to believe it.  Before you shell out money for any other vac, you've got to make it to a dealer and give it a try.  I walked into the dealer thinking I wanted a Riccar or a Sebo or a Dyson, or maybe one of the better Hoovers, but was totally convinced after just 5 minutes with the Miele.
I negociated with a local dealer and was able to get the larger carpet head instead of the smaller one that usually comes with this model for the same price ($800).  Some people may prefer the smaller head to get into smaller spaces, but I liked the bigger one as it's more substancial and covers more area in one pass.
Either way, you will ***LOVE*** this machine.

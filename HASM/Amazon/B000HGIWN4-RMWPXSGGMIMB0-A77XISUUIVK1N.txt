Title: Nikon D80 Digital SLR
Content:
Love this camera!  It replaced my Fuji S2 which was built based on the Nikon body, but the Fuji is heavy and not as fast as it could be.  Since I got the Nikon D80 I've hardly picked up the Fuji.  The Nikon is lighter, faster, and better battery use.  Even when using the D80 with a single battery and not the dual batteries, I've yet to run out of power on one battery.  The Nikon D80 is considerably lighter than the Fuji even with the dual battery pack.  And since the Fuji was based on the Nikon body, I can use my old Nikon lenses as well as the newer Nikon lenses.  Great camera.

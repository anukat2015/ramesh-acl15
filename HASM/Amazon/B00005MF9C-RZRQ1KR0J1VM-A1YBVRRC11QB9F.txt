Title: Too little too soon
Content:
While the concept is a great idea, the implementation stopped a little short. I like dark roast coffee. I use more than 2 tbs. for my brew. The foam covers the hot water spreader and leaves a residue of coffee oils and grounds that is hard to clean off. I am also in a wheel chair. Maybe standing makes pouring the water in easier, I usually make a mess. I also wish the cup was more insulated. The coffee gets cold too soon. It may sound as if I do not like my coffee maker, not so. I just wish for some improvements.Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug

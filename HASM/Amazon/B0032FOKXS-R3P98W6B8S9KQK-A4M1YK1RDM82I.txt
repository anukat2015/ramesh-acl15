Title: Better than you think . . .
Content:
I love my new laptop! I was concerned about the comments regarding the angle of viewing on the screen, but I did not notice anything unusually bad about it. Just tilt, baby, tilt. Also, the issues related to "fingerprints" are over stated, IMHO, as well. Computer is incredibly lightweight and handy -- but I am coming from a Sony Viao with the attached "brick." Everything in the box; and it performed flawlessly. Very pleased with the quality and price.

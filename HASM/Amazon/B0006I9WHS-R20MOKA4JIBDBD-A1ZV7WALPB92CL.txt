Title: Perfect Small Room Heater!
Content:
I bought this heater after seeing how highly rated it is- and you guys were right!  This is the best little heater ever.  I bought it to keep me warm in the bathroom (I have one of those awful new house designs where the master bathroom is completely open to the master bedroom.)  It works great.  Gets very hot or just warm thanks to the dial.  The only down side is that there is no off switch- but it is just as easy to pull the cord out of the wall as it is to turn a switch off!  Portable and can be taken from room to room in one hand.

Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
For a basic grind-and-brew coffee maker, this one is fabulous. Easy to use, easy to clean, and great coffee brewed. Its my third Cuisinart grind-and-brew. Our last one gave us almost two years of constant use in a busy office before needing to be replaced. I'm expecting this one to last at least as long.

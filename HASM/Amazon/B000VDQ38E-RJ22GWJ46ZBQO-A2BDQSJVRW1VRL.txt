Title: Pet hair attacker
Content:
This vacuum destroys pet hair!  The rubber attachment acts like a rubber glove and pulls the stuff off everything.  And the other attachment has a rotary vacuum "mini-sized", and my stairs have never been soooo clean!  It is truly a gift to pet hair.  For reference, we have a chow mix and lab/husky/wolf mix, so I know all about hair!  The only detractor is the thing is loud, and the canister fill up quite quickly with pet hair during shedding season.  But I don't care, because my house is super clean!  (Oh, and it doesn't do much for the bare floor in my opinion!)

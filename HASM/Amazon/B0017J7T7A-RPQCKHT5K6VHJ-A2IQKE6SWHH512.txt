Title: Umm.... WOW?
Content:
I am a software developer and I wanted a new mac that had more power since i was doing lots of animation work.  Here are my first impressions:
1. Very Very bright monitor with great colors.
2. Best keyboard i have ever used.
3. Little to no heat during normal usage (loving this)
4. Best trackpad out there.
5. Pretty good speakers for a laptop.
6. Not very heavy, considering its size.
7. Silent during normal usage.
8. Much Faster than i expected.
I would recommend this notebook for ANYONE!!!

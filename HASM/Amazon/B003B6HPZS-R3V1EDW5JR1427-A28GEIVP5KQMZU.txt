Title: Farm King
Content:
I admit it.  I have become semi-addicted to farming on FaceBook (hence the recent dearth of book reviews here ;-)
My spendy laptop, fine for my "real job," a Dell Inspiron 1501 AMD Turion 64 x 2, TL-60 2 gig DDR2, 15.4 screen, 120 GB HDD, purchased June 2007, just wasn't getting the farming done. FB farming stressed it out - it would overheat and both it and I would become apoplectic. (Even after getting it a fanning stand - after it melted down the plastic coated table cloth on which it sat.)
On a recent trip to that W place which I cannot name herein - but have you seen this movie?Where the Heart Is, I saw this laptop for two ninety nine and figured "what the hay" and bought it.
Farming is now COOL(non-stop, no more having to turn the machine off for cool-down,) no-stress (no more "Will it or won't it work?" roulette,) bright & brilliantly coloured, peaceful and bucolic.

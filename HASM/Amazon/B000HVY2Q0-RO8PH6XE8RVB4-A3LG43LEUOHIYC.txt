Title: Poorly engineered and poorly manufactured.
Content:
I purchased this heater because the much nicer DeLonghi HHP1500 was out of stock and I needed a heater right away. I ended up getting the DeLonghi anyway because the Soleus Air was such a disappointment. When it arrived the knobs were cracked and still had wet glue on them! When I went to turn it on the knob snapped off since the glue hadn't had time to set. It was also warped so the panel isn't flat. I could forgive it for showing up like a garage sale item if it functioned well, but even after I repaired the knobs it is still a low quality product. It smells terrible whenever it is on, even after several months. Also, it is ALWAYS ON. Even when you turn it off and the light turns off, it is still drawing power and generating heat. I have to unplug it when I leave. The only reason it still gets used is because in the end it does generate heat, but that is the best thing I can say for it. Serious waste of money when there are much better heaters for about the same price.

Title: Great at Coffee Making, Lousy customer service
Content:
Great coffee bar however if you should ever need to order spare parts, watch out.. The coffee pot developed a hairline crack in it after a week and of course the coffee leaked out.  I called Amazon first who in turn gave me the number for Delonghi.  I explained the situation and they told me I had to purchase a new pot and that the glass is not covered under warranty.. Here is the kicker, the damn coffee pot is 1/3 the price of the entire machine.  $30.00 for a pot please, $5.50 for shipping.. I will never purchase Delonghi products again knowing this information.

Title: sophisticated features
Content:
Since my last digital camera was a Kodak 2MP camera, this was a huge step for me. I am pretty savvy with computers etc. Still getting used to the varied functions. Exploring and taking alot of pictures. For me its more a general understanding of aperture/ISO etc than the camera itself. The pictures i have taken in the basic mode are excellent. The creative mode needs some work. It is hard to keep a 5 year old , 3 year old kid still while you are trying to figure out the camera though!

Title: OK you asked for it!
Content:
Bought one, wife and I loved it. We live on a 38'" Tolly Craft", right off the San Joaquin River. 38 foot is a nice sized boat, but I like the small "footprint" of this heater. We have purchased 2 more. Main salon, main cabin, main head! "I hate a cold... you know what!"

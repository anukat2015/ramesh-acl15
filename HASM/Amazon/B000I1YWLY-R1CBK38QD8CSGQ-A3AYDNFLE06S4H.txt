Title: I thought my house was clean until I used the Electrolux EL 7055A
Content:
I could not believe the crud coming up from the carpets. We keep a clean house, and for the last 4 years we've been using a kenmore canister with a power head. 
This Electrolux is powerful, easy to use and has impressive results. I only wish I had been using it longer. It is not cheap, but with this model you get what you pay for. The only improvement I could see is an attachment carrier.

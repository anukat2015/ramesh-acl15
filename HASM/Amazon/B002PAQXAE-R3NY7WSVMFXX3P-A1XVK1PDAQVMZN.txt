Title: Great little laptop
Content:
It's portable, light, fast and has between 5-6 hour battery life. The screen is just big enough to work on Excel projects without eye strain...a huge plus in my book. I love the new Windows 7 and the Instant Boot-up features. The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because the touch pad does get in my way occassionally but I have become a bit better at avoiding it when typing. I've had this laptop for a month and I am very pleased with it.

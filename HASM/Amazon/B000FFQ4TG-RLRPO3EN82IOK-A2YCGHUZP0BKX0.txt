Title: Love it
Content:
We just replaced our old Bunn 10 cup brewer with this new model.  I was bit perturbed that we had to replace our old one because it was "only" 7 years old, until I read the reviews here about folks replacing other brands in &lt; 1 year!   I guess we got our money's worth on the last one, which further convinced me to go with another one.  It showed up yesterday and this time I actually read the instructions when setting it up.  Lo and behold,  I learned that you should perform cleaning/maintenance  (including de-liming) on it every 3 months!  Maybe our last one would have lasted longer if we'd done more than just wash the pot and filter basket and run a few extra pots of fresh water thru it every once in awhile. Live and learn...
I like the styling of this one even better than the last.  I like the side-swivel water cover (instead of the flip-up cover on the old one).  I did like that i could swivel the filter basket and move the handle to either side on the old model, while on this one the handle sticks right out front and cannot be moved (a nit pick,really).
This unit doesn't take up as much counter space as the old one.  It is nice that we now have 2 pots, as they did not see the need to re-style/size the pots every year to make them incompatible. 
Final bonus, for us, is that this one was about half the price we paid for the old one, 7 years ago!

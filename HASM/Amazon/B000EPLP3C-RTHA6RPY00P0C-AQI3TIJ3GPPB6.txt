Title: Zune meets the mark!
Content:
I was a little discouraged about getting a Zune at first, but like so often happens, I found it on Amazon for a price that I couldn't pass up. I went ahead and bought it and when I received it I took a little time to figure it out, but once I got it all program up and running I found that it more than met the mark with what I was looking for. With 30 GB worth of room on it, I've got photo album after photo album on it along with about 3,000 songs and I'm down from 27.7 GB to 24.3 (approx.). 
The only thing that I don't like about it is that the battery seems to discharge while its on or off, so I'm constently charging it.
Other than that, I have used it about every day since I've had it and that's been about a month. Great product, get the battery situation worked out and it would be a perfect product!

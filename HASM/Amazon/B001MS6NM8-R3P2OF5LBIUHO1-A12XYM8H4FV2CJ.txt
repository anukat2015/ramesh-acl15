Title: Almost perfect
Content:
Excellent and beautifully screen, I love the full keyboard and the software packages is fantastic.  The start-up, customization and data transfer was easy, the start-up and support software are well design.  The only minor thing I can say is the batteries are actually a haft one and last only an hour in normal setting and also there a problem with the sleep mode and the screen saver... not a big deal for me.  Also to take a grate advantage of the multi-media they should add an HD TV tuner.
But after all it is fast, beautifull and I'm very happy with it.

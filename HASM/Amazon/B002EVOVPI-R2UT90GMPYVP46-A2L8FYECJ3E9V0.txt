Title: The best value for Grind & Brew - buy this one.
Content:
I spent several hours researching a high quality grind & brew coffee maker after owning the grind & brew by Cuisinart for several years. I purchased the Capresso 464.05 model, I have been extremely impressed with this machine. The coffee is piping hot, flavorful and the built-in water filter makes all the difference! The machine is extremely well made and you only have to clean a few parts and not the grinder after every use (so clean the pot, the filter and the filter holder). The Cuisinart had 2 more parts to clean, plus the use of paper filters). The fact that you don't have as many pieces to clean means you can make this great coffee in much less time (I estimate at least 5 minutes are saved). The lid for the bean holder stays on just fine, I've had no problems. This machine is well worth the money.

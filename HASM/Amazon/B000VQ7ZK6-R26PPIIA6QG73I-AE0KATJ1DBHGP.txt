Title: Not so great, just ok
Content:
Ordered one from vendor of Amazon.  Received item very timely.  Was ok to use, took us a little while to figure it out.  Did not come with good detailed instructions.  You are kinda left on your own.  Has really good sound quality.  Touchscreen a little difficult.  Sometimes I had to really swipe my finger to get it to do what I wanted.  After all this and 3 weeks of learning to use it, it died.  The screen went blank.  I could still hear music, but could no longer use the touchscreen.  I did package it up and sent it back to vendor.  Had no problems receiving full refund, plus the shipping I had initially paid.  Will not order another one.  I will look for something different this time around.

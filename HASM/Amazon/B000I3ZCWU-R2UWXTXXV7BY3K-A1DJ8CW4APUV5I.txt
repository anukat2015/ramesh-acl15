Title: Excellent value for the money
Content:
I have been extremely pleased with the Rebel XTi. I'm a relatively new-comer to the SLR world, but have been learning quickly (the XTi helps with the learning process since it is very easy to use). My major impetus in moving into the SLR world was my frustration with the large delay in depressing the shutter and pictures actually being taken with most digital cameras. Now that my children are getting more involved in sports and "moving" activities, I found that my old Sony DSCP93 camera (despite it's very nice pictures), was just not quick enough to capture these moments effectively. (Although I miss being able to just pop it into my pocket...)
The silver body stays nice and cool during the hot days of summer in bright sunlight - which is the only advantage over the black body that I've found (that seems to be why all of the professional Canon-afficianado's prefer those white Canon lenses...). The presets for shooting makes the learning curve a little easier and helps aid in figuring out the intricacies of how to use the advanced features of this camera. Another great part is the large MP of the camera - makes cropping pictures much easier, and still allows for large size photo prints. Overall a great camera.

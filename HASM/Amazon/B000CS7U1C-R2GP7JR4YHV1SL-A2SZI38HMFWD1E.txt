Title: A good iPod alternative
Content:
Got this player a couple of months ago as a birthday present. I had an iPod previously, but I despised the bloated nature of iTunes and the annoying limitations of the types of files that it could use.
First, the good points:
- The player has a great display, one of the best I've ever seen on a handheld player. Much better quality than anything turned out by Apple so far, my copy of 300 looks brilliant on it.
- Supports quite a few more formats. Avi. files were my main target.
- Great sound quality.
- Tons of space. I was really surprised how much I fit on here. I managed my entire music collection and several seasons of MST3K as well.
- The FM receiver is pretty handy when you'd like to get news or a weather forecast.
Now, the negatives:
- This player has a tendency to lock up if you are impatient in letting it load a song/video. If this happens, the player won't even let you turn  it off. You're stuck either having to hit the reset button (more on that later) or waiting for the battery to die. Either way, it's irritating when it happens.
- The reset button is unnecessarily difficult to push. Even a pen or pencil won't do it, you practically have to get a paperclip or needle.
- The touch pad, even on it's least sensitive setting, is still too inaccurate to compete with the clickwheel.
Despite these problems, it makes a solid alternative choice to the iPod if you're looking for a player with better video quality.

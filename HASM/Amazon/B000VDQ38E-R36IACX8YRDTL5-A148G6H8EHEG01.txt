Title: Absolutely LOVE IT
Content:
I purchased this vacuum a couple months ago and decided to wait a couple months before writing my review for it.  And let me tell you I absolutely love this vacuum. I have two 75 lb. labs and a cat and it's springtime in Wisconsin so they are all shedding their winter coats all over my house along with tracking mud and dirt in from outside and to this day it still sucks it all up and then some.  I actually feel like my floors and furniture are clean when I am done vacuuming unlike my previous vacuum.  The attachments work wonderful on cushions and in crevices - I would even recommend this to people without pets - that's how much faith I have in the cleaning power of this machine.  
When I was looking for a new vacuum, I read the reviews for this one and was hesitant due to some of the bad reviews.  After much thought and realizing most of them are common sense fixes, I decided to give it a try.  I empty the bin after each room and depending on how bad the room is, I sometimes empty half way through vacuuming as well.  This allows the suction to work properly - as we all know that the more dirt in the canister the less air flow - which will affect the suction.  I also take the canister etc. apart occassionally and rinse in the sink and allow to dry before I reassemble to keep the dirt from building up outside the canister so that it doesn't leave excess dirt on my floors when I dump the canister.  I will also occassionally wipe down my vacuum as it will get dirty on the outside - just like everything else.  See common sense fixes.

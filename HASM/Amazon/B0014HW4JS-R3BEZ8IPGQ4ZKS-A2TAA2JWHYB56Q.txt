Title: Did not like it for the price
Content:
I purchased this to get better performence. I had a VGN-FS780 before.
The only thing I can say good about this is it is a fast machine and the case looks nice.
I ended up returning mine.
The cooling fan is to loud and it blows the exhaust out the left side which I didnt like it is easy to cover it while grabbing the machine.
Also the screen on this was very dissapointing. I was used to my old Vaio with a nice bright screen. This computer has a nice screen BUT only if your looking at it straight on.
If you stand up and look down at this comuter you cant see much at all. Its similar to the rear projection tvs where you have to be in the sweet spot to get the best picture.
Also I did not like the design of the static mouse. I am used to running my fingers over the pad to FEEL for the button. On this machine they made the buttons flush with the surface so you have to look at the pad to find the buttons

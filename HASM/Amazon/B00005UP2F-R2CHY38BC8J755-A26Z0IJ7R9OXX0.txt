Title: Vision canister is wonderful!
Content:
We've always owned uprights.  This time I went searching on the internet for one -- looked at Eureka and Hoover, but settled on this wonderful canister for our house instead.  It's got it all for less money:  powerful (12 amps), bagless (you can see the dirt getting sucked in), lightwieight, quiet, hepa filter, quality build, variable speed control, retracting cord, works on carpet (powered brush) and hard floors, great price.  It looks cool too.  We opened it and immediately vacuumed the house and furniture, etc.  We pulled up much more animal hair and misc. fluffies than our old powered eurka upright.  I was sold right off when I could vacuum under the couch and bed -- without even moving them!  It goes where no upright can go and is much lighter.  It a very powerful 12 amp unit with lots of attachments right in the base of the unit (not on the wand like some Eureka's).  We got lots of tools with it, including an extra hard floor tool.  The powered brush head is nice because it has a separate foot button (separate from main power) so you can quickly turn the brush off and on as needed.  Great product!!

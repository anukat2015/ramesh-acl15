Title: Auto-Shut Off
Content:
I bought this product due to the automatic shut-off feature, which seems to be so hard to find!  
My father is the type to put on a kettle of water to boil (which doesn't whistle) at 5am while everyone else is still sleeping and then go outside.  So, for my mother's sanity (and both of their saftey) this was an ideal solution.
I also own one, and have been very satisfied with it.  In fact, I've had it for many years and it still works fine.
You just fill it with water, add coffee or a tea bag in your mug, and simply walk away.  Give it a few mintues, come back, and it's ready & brewed.
Another benefit it that you can use almost any size mug (and comes with a travel mug) whereas others use just small cups.

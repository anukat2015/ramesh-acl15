Title: About filters....
Content:
The mention of filters that I saw was a recommedation for a TRAP, not a filter, as it was called. It is common in professionally installed propane appliances to have a trap. I haven't ever seen a trap used on a portable appliance. The trap is essentially a pipe "T" with a short section of pipe going down, terminated by a cap. The other side of the "T" goes up to the appliance.The trap allows chunks of debris fall into it; it is in no way a filter.

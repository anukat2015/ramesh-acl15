Title: WONDERFUL CAMERA
Content:
I love this camera. I spent a month researching cameras and reading everything I could find. I have four children that the first is graduating this year with the others right behind. I wanted to give them the senior pictures that they wanted but just couldn't justify the cost with having to do it for so many children. A friend recommend I look into buying a camera and taking my own. I'm glad I did, I was able to take the pictures they wanted plus for a couple of their friends who couldn't afford it as well. It has been so much fun and I still have prom and graduation coming up. This camera is wonderful with such a wide range of choices to offer from the novice to the more advanced photographer. This camera is not difficult to use at all and I personnally couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Title: I had high hopes, but was dissapointed
Content:
1.  After doing a lot of research on various DSLRs, I decided to get the Olympus 510.   I was so sure that this would be a great camera that I also got the 2 kit lens deal along with an additional 11-22mm wide angle lens.  
2.  This is a nice camera and should do the job for most folks.   
3.  The reason I ended up returning this camera was because of the slight decreased dynamic range.   The JPEG images are just overtly too contrasty (I'm sure that you can adjust the parameters in the menus), but even RAW files have decreased dynamic range compared to other DSLRs--> which is really a deal breaker for me since I shoot mainly landscapes, esp mountains with a lot of snow etc... 
4.   If you just want an nicely made, compact DSLR for average shooting-> this would be a nice buy.   But if your photography requires more than less dynamic range--> search elsewhere.

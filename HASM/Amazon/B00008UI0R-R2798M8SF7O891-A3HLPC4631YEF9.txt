Title: Excellent!!!
Content:
We recently moved into a house that has 95% wood floors.  We also have two dogs around 100 lbs each; a lab and a golden.  So you can imagine the hair.  I knew I would be spending a small fortune in bags to keep up with these animals so I started shopping for a bagless vacuum.  After much research I choose this one and I am very satisfied.  
I was a little worried about the price and also ordering without trying it out first, but I am SO happy I did. This vacuum is very powerful, easy to use, light, has decent options and attachments, and pretty quiet compared to my old everyday vacuum.

Title: Fantastic Heater and Money Saver
Content:
DeLonghi TRN0812T Oil-Filled Radiator  This is a fantastic heater, especially for the money.  It does not blow hot air with a noisy fan (there is no fan) but rather heats an entire room and then some.  It never had any smell as some reviewers have stated, but just quietly sits there making a 15 x 19 bedroom and ajoining master bath very warm while only using a maximum of 1200 watts. I have quartz heaters, regular fan type heaters, but this is my first oil heater and I will be replacing the others with this same heater.  When temperatures do not go below 30 degrees, you can use the maximum 500 or 700 watt setting to keep the area around 75 degrees.  Amazing how something can be so efficient, quiet, and not smelly.  Very easy to program for on and off times and safe to use in a bathroom.  I have other quartz DeLonghi heaters that are great too, but they only heat a specific area and they are a little noisy and use a whole lot more energy to produce heat.  It is very nice to walk anywhere in a room and be warm in every part, whereas you do not get that with other types of space heaters.

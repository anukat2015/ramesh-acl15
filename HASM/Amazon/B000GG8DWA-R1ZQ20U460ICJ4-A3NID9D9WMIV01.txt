Title: doesn't have a fan? WHAT!! lol
Content:
I'm just reading the negative reviews and laughing. If you aren't familiar with these type of heaters, please don't purchase one. For those of us, who don't want to have one of those oxygen sucking heater fans, look no further, and purchase this heater.
Of course, you must understand this heater may possibly break if it's tipped over. It has a safety device in case a pet knocks it over, so it doesn't start a fire. From what I've read this heater shouldn't break, just turn off, but the bottom line is I wouldn't hold it sideways and turn it on to test it out.
Use  a lot of common sense with this heater. These types of heaters can be DANGEROUS! (I wouldn't use an extension cord either).
Overall, if you like fireplaces, you'll probably enjoy this mini version. If you're looking for a smaller 300W version, I suggest the Optimus H-4110 9-Inch Dish Heater, which I also recently purchased.

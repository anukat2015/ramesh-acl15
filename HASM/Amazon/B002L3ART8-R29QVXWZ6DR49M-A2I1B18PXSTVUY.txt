Title: LOVE IT
Content:
THIS  IS A GREAT VACUUM FOR MY HOUSEHOLD.  IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT WHICH IS A BONUS SINCE LUGGING AROUND A CANISTER VAC CAN BE A PAIN.  IT HAS GREAT SUCTION AND WORKS VERY WELL ON MY LOW PILE AREA RUGS. -- MOST OF MY HOUSE HAS WOOD FLOORING.  IT IS VERY QUIET SO AFTER I PUT THE KIDS TO BED, I CAN VACUUM AND THEY DO NOT WAKE UP FROM THE NOISE.  IT HAS A HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT SO MY HUSBAND LIKES IT ALSO SINCE HE IS TALL.  IT ROLLS EASILY AND GETS INTO DIFFICULT SPACES.  THE PRICE IS ALSO GREAT.  I FEEL I GOT A GOOD DEAL ON THIS, I JUST HOPE IT LASTS.  I PREVIOUSLY HAD A KENMORE AND HATED IT--VERY HEAVY AND ALWAYS IN THE SHOP.  THIS HAS A NICE, LONG CORD THAT RETRACTS W/GREAT EASE.  I HAVE NO NEGATIVES ON THIS.  IT PROBABLY ISN'T FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGH PILE CARPET BUT FOR ME IT'S GREAT!

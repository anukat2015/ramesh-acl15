Title: Not worth the price for convenience
Content:
Sure this is a very convenient device, but not worth the hassle in my opinion. I can heat water in the microwave faster than this can brew tea (warm-up time is what takes the most time). I realize that once it's warmed-up it brews multiple cups fast, but this seems like an expensive way to warm-up water. I thought it was annoying that it told you it was empty and to fill it with water even though it was still 1/3 full? I felt the coffee options (not including buying a re-usable filter and using your own coffee grounds) tasted very weak. I'm returning mine; I'm glad I gave it a try and now I know it's not for me.

Title: Heats fine but thermostat does not work.
Content:
Works fine to heat up a small enclosed room.  However, the thermostat is useless.  After adjusting as instructed to the point where the unit first turns off, it will never turn back on, no matter how cool the room gets.  You either have to turn up the heater manually or just be cold.  I have a Holmes model HCH4266 in another room that cycles on and off like it is supposed to but this model is either on or off, no cycling to maintain temperature.
Unit appears well built for the price and it does spit out the heat which is it most important job but just do not expect for the thermostat to work.

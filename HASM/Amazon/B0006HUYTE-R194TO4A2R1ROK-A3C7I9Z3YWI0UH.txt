Title: Great little vacuum!
Content:
This vacuum was one of the first purchases we made when we started our janitorial company three years ago. It has been money well spent! I only gave it 4 stars because there are 2 things that I would have changed on the design and they are really more annoyances than defects. The first one is I would add an automatic winding reel for the cord. It's a real pain to have to wind it up after each use to transport. The other thing I'd change is on the floor tool. We use it a lot on bare floors. Another model we have has 2 small wheels on the bottom of the floor tool that helps it ride more smoothly on the surface. 
For a small vacuum it has a lot of suction and the telescoping wand is a great idea! Just push or pull on the handle while holding the locking mechanism and voila! 
Changing the bags and filter is a snap! The vacuum only weighs 10 lbs. so it's easy to carry and has a handy shoulder strap. It could be a little quieter but it's not any worse than the vacuum I use in my home. 
I recommend the commercial (red) version over the residential (yellow). For $40 more you get a larger motor and better hose and tools. The residential model seems to heat up a lot more than the commercial model probably due to the smaller motor. But you pay for that in weight, 10 lbs versus 8 lbs. The residential model's hose is a joke! It is so lightweight that it bends and crimps all the time. Also the residential model does not come with a shoulder strap.
We've used this vacuum on every job from residential cleaning to commercial cleaning to construction clean-up. It has never failed to deliver! I recommend it!

Title: Quiet and warm
Content:
I bought this heater for my office which is about 11x12. The heater keeps this area comfortably warm on the lowest setting. It is light enough to place on a sturdy low table or foot stool so that the heat can be directed above the floor. I bought the Optimus H-5210 last November and I am very pleased. I plan to order another one for my husband.

Title: Beware, if you think it has a HDMI!
Content:
I just received this nice 15.6" notebook and I admit that I like it!  The sound is great.  The keypad is really handy when you need it. And the reponse of this computer is satisfying with windows 7 loaded.  
However, pictures in its product page might be a deceiving.  Although they are shown in the pics, this model does NOT come with a webcam and HDMI.  I was surprised when I opened the box and found this truth.  Hence, I further digged into the specification sheet and found that I was wrong.  Beware, if you think this is really a steal with a webcam and HDMI for this low price, you may just make a mistake like what I did.  
In all, I do not regret my decision of buying it at all.  You can buy a netbook for $299.99. But I will pay a little bit more to go with this notebook ($379.99) with full capability, faster processing speed and a DVD burner in trade of the mobility.  Now, I am going return my cute but slow netbook...

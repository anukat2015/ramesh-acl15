Title: Started with 4GB.  Wish there were more color choices.
Content:
I purchased two of these for my husband and I to enjoy at the gym.  I Love the size and it is really easy to figure out!  In retrospect I wish I would have payed the extra $50 to upgrade to the 8GB.  Not to mention, it would have been nice to get different colors.  I would have liked to have seen an option for more than just the silver.  Maybe one of these days, they will come out with a trade up program.. =)

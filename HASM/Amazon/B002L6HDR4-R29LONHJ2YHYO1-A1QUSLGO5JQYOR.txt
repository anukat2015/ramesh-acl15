Title: Color?
Content:
I was getting a little tired of the size of my iPod Touch, and found myself wanting a slimmer, trimmer iPod to tuck easily into my pocket.  So when a friend of mine showed me his new Nano it was probably inevitable that I get one.  I've had previous versions of the Nano as well as the shuffle and am happy with this one, with the exception of the battery life, which a number of users have already commented on.  I have a iCraig radio at my office (didn't want to get an expensive radio that might "walk"), and it charged my old Nano, but not this one.  I ran it with the backlight on yesterday, and that depleted the battery almost completely so I had to plug it into my computer's USB drive to power it back up.  I now use the backlight timer and it helps, although I was surprised to see that the energy bar went down quite a bit even so.
One additional thing - maybe it's my computer screen, but the purple Nano on the screen is a lighter purple than the one I received.  It is also darker than some I have seen in the stores.  May not be a big deal, and I'm not saying this is Amazon's fault, but if someone is very particular about color, they may want to make their purchase in person.

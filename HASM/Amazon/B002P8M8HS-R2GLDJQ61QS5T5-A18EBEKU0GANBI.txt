Title: Great laptop!
Content:
This laptop has been great.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks and just love it.  It's easy to use, the screen size is great and the speed is fast (mainly used for web surfing).  It doesn't lock up like my desktop does frequently.  The "mouse pad" is a bit sensitive but there is probably a setting I can change, just haven't taken the time to look.  It is a bit on the heavy side, not something I would want to lug around town, but perfectly fine for home use.  I am very pleased with this laptop and felt the price was right too, around $500 - $550 & free shipping to boot.

Title: Just okay
Content:
We registered for this coffee maker as a wedding gift based on a family member's recognition. Though it makes good coffee, and is easy and convenient to set up, it is very difficult to clean. You are supposed to clean the grinder after each use, and I find that coffee grinds easily get in nooks and crannies you wouldn't think they would. If I realized how time consuming this would be to clean, I would have registered for a separate coffe maker and grinder.

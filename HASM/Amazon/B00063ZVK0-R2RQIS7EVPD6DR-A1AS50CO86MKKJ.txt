Title: It broke after one week!
Content:
I have an excellent Vornado fan that I've happily used for several years, so I was expecting this heater to be of similar quality, efficiency, and durability.  Additionally, I read good reviews of this heater both on Amazon and elsewhere, so my expectations were high.
Alas, the heater didn't heat very well at all, not even when it was a few feet away, much less warming the whole room, and one week after I started using it, the power switch broke (it has a push button power switch, that when depressed, slipped off to the side and never emerged again).
Perhaps this machine was simply defective; my advice would be to buy one, if you must, where you can easily return it if necessary.  Luckily, I bought from an excellent third party vendor on Amazon (Uncle Joe's) who provided outstanding customer service.

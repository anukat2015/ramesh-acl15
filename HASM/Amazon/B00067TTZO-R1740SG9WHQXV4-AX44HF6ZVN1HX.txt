Title: Couldn't ask for a better player my first time purchasing an MP3!
Content:
I purchased my Zen in February and absolutely love it! Apple's iPod gets all the publicity, therefore there are a lot of buyers. The Zen is a hidden treasure that has many more options than the iPod mini, for the same price. It has been said that the Zen's touchpad is difficult to use; that is totally untrue. If you are having trouble with the sensitivity of the touchpad, there is the option of changing the setting to a medium or low sensitivity. The sound quality is great; it sounds like a concert hall, instead of the feeling of its right next to your eardrums. My Zen has frozen once, but if you take out the battery, and then restore it, everything is back to normal and nothing is lost. The Zen also has a radio, microphone, calender, contacts, tasks, and the option of creating your own playlist. I love the size of the Zen; its as tall as your middle finger, and is great to look at. Sometimes it can shut down on you, it calls it an idle shutdown. This only occurs when music is not playing and it is just sitting around; but not to worry, you can ajust the amount of minutes until it shuts down also. The Zen comes in an array of colors, mine is a purple grape color. I can't wait to get the iTrigue spreakers that come in the color of your Zen! Please, do not just jump on the iPod bandwagon; try something out of the norm. You will not be disapointed!

Title: Best Media Player I have ever owned!
Content:
I was torn between getting an iPod video and a Cowon iAudio X5. The iPod had superior video, but the iAudio played numerous formats. The iPod also required the use of iTunes. Then my answer came. The Creative Zen Vision:M. It actually has a higher resolution than the  iPod video. The device converts almost any video or audio to a format supported by the Zen as long as your PC has the codec installed (Quicktime to Windows Media for example).
I owned two previous non-video iPods and had a hard time adjusting to the Zen's control scheme. The menu system, after learning it is very intuitive and the best I have seen. The menu's are stylish and can be skinned. 
USE: I took this with me on a trip with the military. I was able   watch videos on my flights without any problems with my eyes. As for sound, the audio sounds as good as, if not better than, the iPods without the EQ on. Turning it on makes it even better. The battery life is amazing as well. I was able to go 5 days on all commutes listening to music and only spent half the battery.
The only drawback to the player is that it does not support podcasts that use Apple's native video format. It must convert the files first on the PC during transfer. This can take, at times, hours. Creative really needs to add native player support for that format in an update.

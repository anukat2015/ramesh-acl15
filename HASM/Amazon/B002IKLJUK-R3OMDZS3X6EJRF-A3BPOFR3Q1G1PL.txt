Title: waste of money stay away
Content:
i got this camera about two weeks ago and i was playing with it every day trying to convins my self that i am wrong if i would return it.i was so excited when i received it.but i was very disapointed after the first shot.but here they are...do not know where to start first.i own a canon sd 550 is a nice piece of work for more than four years.Very NICE LOOKING CAMERA beautiful still pictures and outstanding video.I use my camera more for shuting small videos if i am on a trip,or party etc.The only complaint i have is that in night time if i try to take a picture of a building everything is very dark...#2 very often red eye when using the flash...#3 sometimes bluered picture...other than that my camera is very good.So i am looking for a new camera to replace my old one.I decided to try the GF1 after reading the above reviews.FIRST THE PICTURE QUALITY IS POOR COMPARING WITH MY CANON.(I AM USING THE AUTO SETTING TO COMPARE THE TWO CAMERAS)PICTURES LOOK UNDER EXPOSED THEY ARE DARKER THAN CANON, NO SHARPNESS THEY DO NOT LOOK NATURAL.I CAN SAY IF YOU REED THE REVIEWS FOR PANASONIC ZS3 IS THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT THE PICTURE.SECOND THERE ARE NOT ANY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE LCD SCREEN SO THERE IS NOT CONTROL OVER YOUR SCREEN.IN BRITE SUN IS HARD TO SEE WHAT YOU SHOOTING.MORE,CAMERA IS HEVY, MANUAL ZOOMING IS RETARDED.IN NIGHT TIME IF YOU TAKE PICTURES INSIDE A BIG ROOM IF YOU USE THE FLASH PICTURES ARE DARKER WITH A TINT OF ORANGE PURPULISH.TURN OFF THE FLASH AND THEY COME OUT GOOD BUT AGAIN UNDER EXPOSED.ALSO PROBLEMS WITH BLUERED PICTURES.I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT A PERSON THAT LIKES TO TRASH PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET I NEVER WROTE A REVIEW IN MY LIFE BUT,I DO NOT WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO MAKE AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE.I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER I AM JUST A REGULAR GUY LOOKING FOR NORMAL PICTURES AND MOVIE.NOW THE VIDEO HAS ITS PROBLEMS TO...HD GOOD FOR YOU TUBE...AGAIN NO SHARPNESS AND DARK...USLESS.SO I AM GIVING IT ONE STAR AFTER PLAING WITH IT OR BETTER SAYING AFTER CAREFOOL TESTING IT JUST BECAUSE LOOKS LIKE GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD LOOKING.BUT I AM TRYING TO BUY A CAMERA NOT A GOOD LOOKING TOY.MY OLD CANON GOT LUKY AGAIN.

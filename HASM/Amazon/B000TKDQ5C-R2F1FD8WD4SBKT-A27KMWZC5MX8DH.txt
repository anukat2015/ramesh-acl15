Title: Fairly Good Office Heater
Content:
I just purchased this heater a few weeks ago for use in my office.
Pros: compact size, very strong heat, average noise level
Cons: thermostat does not seem to work well (it stays on forever and if I turn it down, it never seems to come back on by itself), heat is almost too hot for Texas winters (and I keep in on the lower heat setting, so it would probably be great for a really cold location)
I probably would pick a different one next time, but it serves its purpose for now (and for a reasonable price).

Title: Decorative and Effective - REVISED REVIEW
Content:
While this heater is smaller than the other Laskos, it heats just as well. While it won't warm a large room, it works quite well in a small one. It heats my 10x12 bathroom at least 10 degrees in 15-20 minutes. I've gotten more use out of this little heater in the past 2-3 months than I thought I ever would. It also feels great just to sit in front of it for a quick warm-up. I'm really happy I decided to buy this.
REVISED 12/31/09: Well, I've had this for over a year and I'm ready to replace it. While still putting out the heat, it's not as warm and only heats on high. The low and temperature settings have also ceased to work. I only use it in my bathroom on mornings where the room is 70 degrees or below, which means approximately 3 1/2 months here in North Carolina. Just don't spend a lot of money on this and don't expect it to last very long.

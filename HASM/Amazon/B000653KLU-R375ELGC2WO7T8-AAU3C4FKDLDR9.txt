Title: Returning it after four weeks of usage
Content:
I have experience with oil heaters and this one I thought would be great to control with a wireless temperature controller. I liked the that it slowly heats up my master bedroom nicely although if the units temperature setting in anywhere in the 90 degrees it emits a horrible smell. I know about the horrible smell when the unit is brand new but that usually dissipate during the first few usage. The digital read out is still hard to read during the daytime, during night time usage you have to turn on your bedroom lights. Also, when I wanted to move the unit to another room after using in my bedroom, there are no handles that will help pull the unit into another room so I had to get pot-holders to move the unit while it was still hot. This unit does heat the room up nicely although the digital readout needs to be easier to read during night time usage and a handle to pull the unit while it is cool or warm would be a nicer future features. Two stars because the unit did heat up my M.bedroom plus bathroom nicely within in an hours time.

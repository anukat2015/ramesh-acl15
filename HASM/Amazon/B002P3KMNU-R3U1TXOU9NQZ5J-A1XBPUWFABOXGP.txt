Title: Great Computer Poor Warranty Support
Content:
I bought this computer for everyday use.  I take it to the office with me everyday and here are my thoughts:
Pros: 1. Light weight. When I replaced my old Dell with this computer it was like I was not carrying anything in my bag.  I had to check a couple of times to ensure that something was in there.
2. Keyboard: It is a beautiful keyboard and I really enjoying typing with it.
3. Screen: Screen is beautiful and brilliant.
4. HDD size: The 500gb size can't be beat.
5. Battery Life: the battery life is as long.  I had the machine running on full performance for 9 hours one day before it died.  
Cons: 1. The trackpad is very sensitive.  You have to adjust it to make it work a little better.  I suggest an external mouse.
2. Processor: The processor is plenty powerful what I do at the office but it's not the fastest.  If you need speed look at other machines.
3. Warranty: My Hard Drive starting making loud clicking noises after 11 weeks of ownership.  I called and they made me fill out a form with my credit card info before they would send me a new HD.  They did offer for me to ship the computer to them at my expense and they'll swap the HD, but it would only be the stock info on it.  So, I elected for them to send me a replacement HD and I will need to do the cloning.  The HD is due to arrive 10 days after the forms were received.  When I asked the customer service rep about it all she could say is "I Understand" and "a manager will email you".  The latter has never happened.  Bottom line, if you're counting the warranty think twice or have a back up.  
Otherwise, I am generally very happy with the machine.  I just hope the HDD issue is resolved quickly.

Title: Plug Gets Too Hot
Content:
I would give this 4 stars, but the electrical plug on this heater gets really,really hot.  It has melted any extension cord or surge protector that I have plugged it into.  This is the first appliance that I have seen do this.  It is strange that the electrical plug gets hotter than the actual heater.  The heater actually comes with a warning about this, but I did not expect it to be so bad.  If the plug gets knocked out of the outlet, you can be sure of burns, damage to floors and carpets and/or fire.  Also, I guess there could be some risk of fire from a melting surge protector.

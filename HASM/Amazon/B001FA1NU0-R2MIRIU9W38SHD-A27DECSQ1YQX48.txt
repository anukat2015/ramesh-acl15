Title: Say good-bye to the discman!
Content:
I love this little thing.  I finally threw out my Sony discman and upgraded to the Ipod shuffle.  I was considering the Ipod Nano, but I don't need all the other features on the Nano.  This unit is very basic, convienient, reliable and easy to use.  The sound quality is perfect. My only complaint is the ear phones, I threw these out and bought Sony ear plugs which fit snuggly and comfortably[...].  This unit is perfect for everyday use(walking, running, biking, etc.) ***Highly recommended***

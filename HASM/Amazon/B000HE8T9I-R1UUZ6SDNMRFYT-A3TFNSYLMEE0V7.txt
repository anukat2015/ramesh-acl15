Title: Waste of money
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about 2 years now.  It started having problems and breaking after about 9 months.  The biggest problem I have with it is the dust trap and filters clog up to fast.  Is seems that every time I use it it needs cleaning and the cleaning is very time consuming.
It overheats fast and shuts off and it clogs easily.  I have never had to take a vacuum apart as much as I have this one.  This is my first bagless vacuum and I hate it.  I feel I get exposed to so much dust emptying the canister.  I think I will go back to a bag system.

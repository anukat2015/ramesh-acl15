Title: Great value and performance
Content:
This heater warms up both my bedroom (10x10 feet) and my living room (10x20 feet) effectively within a few minutes if I close all of the doors. I have been surprised at how well it works. I like the simplicity of the timer (you can set it to stay on for 1, 2, or 4 hours), and the remote control is great--the buttons are large, which helps when one is trying to adjust the settings sleepily from bed. My cord doesn't seem to get hot, as some reviewers have reported. My only complaint is that it is difficult to carry around. There's a recess from which you can lift it, but there's no edge to grip on to. I move the heater around to different rooms throughout the day, so this aspect of the design is annoying. Not sure yet about efficiency (I haven't received my first pg&e bill since getting it). Otherwise, it's perfect.

Title: Tremendous camera
Content:
This camera was a big purchase for me and I have not regretted it for an instant.  In 9 months I have taken 3000 pictures.  For image quality, ease of use, and ability to utilize a range of lenses this camera is tops. Even the cheap kit lens (18-55) is a fantastic value. 
Here's what I like:
Small and lightweight for an DSLR - I  packback so weight and volume are important to me.  This is a smaller and lighter pkg than other similar cameras.
The fabulous screen.  It is a total knockout. Altho I haven't had the opportunity to use it as such yet, I want to use this camera for astrophotography.  Focusing on stars can be a trick but this camera's hi res screen at 10x should allow great focus.
Qualty of the pictures is first rate.  I've read about the soft-focus complaints, banding, poor color handling etc.  I have not found any of this to be true.  When compared with the output from Nikons taken at the same time on the same trip (and in fact significantly more expensive Canons) I see the difference is primarily in the users ability - not in the camera's capability. 
Lens selection and quality - Canon and varous second tier manufacturers offer a great range of capability out there.  I'm sure Nikons offer about the same but for slection and bang for the buck, the Canon line is excellent. 
What would I like to see and don't.  Where's my articulated screen?
I'd recommend this camera to anyone. It is a fabulous value.

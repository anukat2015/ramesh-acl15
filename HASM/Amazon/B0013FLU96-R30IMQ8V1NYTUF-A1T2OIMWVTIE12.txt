Title: Tough conversion
Content:
While I'm enjoying the speed and other capabilities of the MacBook Pro, converting from a pc was not a joyful experience. After a month and a half, I'm still frustrated with some of the nuances of the change.  There are printer compatibility issues, for example, and iTunes ratings and playcount data did not transfer over from my pc. Navigating pages is also slightly different, and after years of doing things the pc way, old habits are dying hard.  I was also led to believe that the Mac never crashes, which is a myth.  They are less frequent than on the pc, but they still do happen.  I guess, at the moment, I'm planning to be ecstatically happy about this purchase, but I'm not there yet.

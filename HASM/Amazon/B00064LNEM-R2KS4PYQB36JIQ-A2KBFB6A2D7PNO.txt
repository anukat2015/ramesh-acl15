Title: Makes awsome "Hot" coffee!
Content:
It's slightly bulky and awkward with the small reservoir opening and the fact it has to be turned sideways to fill but makes absolutely great coffee.  It is hot when brewed and stays hot on the hot plate.  That alone is worth the little bit of hassle.  AWSOME coffee!

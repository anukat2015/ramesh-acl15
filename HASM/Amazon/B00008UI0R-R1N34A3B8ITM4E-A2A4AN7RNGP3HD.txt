Title: Two canister failures
Content:
I bought my first hoover canister vacuum about 4yrs ago and at first loved it. I thought the suction was great and I loved the ease of changing out attachments. However, as the months went on the vacuum slowly fell apart. The foot pedal to disconnect the main attachment broke so I had to use a screwdriver to change out the attachments after that. The suction started going downhill, the hose ripped, etc. But the biggest problem I had was that it would short out on me...sometimes it would turn on and other times it wouldn't until finally it stopped working all together. I had the first one for 2yrs before it kicked the bucket. Because I was happy with it for awhile and the price was decent I went ahead and bought another hoover canister right after the first one broke. It's been almost two years since I bought the second one and I have had all the same exact problems! So I've gone through two of these canister vacuums in less than 4yrs. It's not only the canister vacuums I've had problems with. In the last 11yrs of my marriage I've gone through various hoover vacuums and each one only last about 2yrs. I've finally accepted the fact that they are NOT made to last!! I've finally learned my lesson and will NEVER buy another hoover vacuum ever again!

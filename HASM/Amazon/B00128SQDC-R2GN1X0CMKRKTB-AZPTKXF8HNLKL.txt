Title: I love my D80
Content:
I bought my Nikon D80 early November and am having a blast with it.
The rapid burst mode is perfect for my high action soccer and softball shots.  I am able to get incredible high resolution, in focus, in frame pictures of my kids.  I LOVE this camera.  I still have a lot to learn however, and am fairly new to digital photography.  I was able to pick this up and use before reading the manual.  I am still working through the functionality, and am pleasantly surprised everytime I figure out a new feature I did not know I had.

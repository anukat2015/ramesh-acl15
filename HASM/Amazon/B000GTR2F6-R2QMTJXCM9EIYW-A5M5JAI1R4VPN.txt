Title: Great machine and service
Content:
Keurig provided a replacement of a B70 at a below market price when my B60 started to act up after 4 years.  Unfortunately the B70 they sent was defective--it made awful noises and water would not flow.  It was just a bad unit.  Contrary to what has been written by others, the people at Keurig were prompt, courteous and efficient.  They had a replacement out to me in no time along with quite a bit of coffee by way of an apology.  Also, when the B70 is working properly, as the replacement has been, it is not a noisy machine at all.  I like the selection of coffee and the convenience and I'm not usually looking for the kind of coffee I get with my French press.  But it isn't a requirement to eliminate one just because you have the other.

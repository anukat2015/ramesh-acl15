Title: what a nice job!!!
Content:
When Sony sent me an email about this laptop, I knew my old IBM would be replaced very soon. Sony can never disappoint you in any ways. It is so light but powerful, the screen looks nice, and the keys are very comfortable. my school has wireless connection and i use this laptop in school with high speed internet, it just makes everything so much easier. 40G is not that increditable big, but good enough for ppl who wants to bring this lil guy on trip. Sony once again rocks.

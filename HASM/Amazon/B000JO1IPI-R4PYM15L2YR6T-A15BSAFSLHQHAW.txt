Title: Don't Believe All The Reviews
Content:
I've never written a review before, but felt I had to this time because some of the negative reviews here almost kept me from buying a terrific product.  Specifically, I was concerned about comments about the scroll wheel not functioning properly, and about comments about accessories for previous iPods not working on the Classic.  
Fortunately, I went to Best Buy and was able to play with their display model for quite a while.  I used the scroll wheel extensively and found that I had no problems with it at all.  
All my accessories for my iPod minis work with the Classic, including my AC charger and the adapter I use to listen to the iPod through my car radio.
I was surprised at how watchable video is on the Classic; I thought the small screen would be impossible.  But, the picture quality is so good that I actually find that I would watch videos on this iPod while traveling.  I've been converting video files and loading them onto the Classic with zero problems. 
I've had no problems syncing the Classic with iTunes either.  I wonder if those having problems are limited by computer resources.  I have a HP Pavilion running XP with 2Gb of RAM.
All in all, I'm thrilled with the Classic and strongly recommend that folks check it out for themselves rather than just believing the reviews (including this one!).

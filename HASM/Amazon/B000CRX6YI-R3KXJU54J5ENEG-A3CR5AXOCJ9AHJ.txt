Title: Great upgrade from D70
Content:
I think you should have experience with digital and SLR photography prior to investing in this near pro-class DSLR. Yes, you can point and shoot (remember to manually pop up the flash when needed)but the multitude of features allow amazing flexibility. Add the 18-200mm Nikkor VR, and an extra Nikon battery, for a travel package that will have you planning your next trip. Problem: You will find yourself viewing and composing photographs all your waking hours. Hope you have an understanding travel partner.

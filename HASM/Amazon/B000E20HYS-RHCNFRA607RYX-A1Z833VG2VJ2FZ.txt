Title: leaked to begin with, got up this morning and the spout was laying on the counter!
Content:
I have not contacted the seller but this product leaked at the spout the very first time we used it.  My son has one and we just loved it.  It also has a leak at the spout and you have to put a paper towel or something to catch it when it is in use.  I just assumed it would be like my sons and just leak a little when it was in use.  I guess ours was a crack in the spout and this morning (was not used last night) the spout was just laying on the counter. Really enjoyed it, just didn't get to use it much since it was a Christmas gift and now on January 17th - less than a  month -  we can't use it anymore!!Back to Basics CM300BLSS Cocoa-Latte Stainless-Steel 32-Ounce Hot-Drink Maker

Title: I love it!
Content:
I have only had this a few days but I love it so far.  It is very compact and has a strong fan, with a nice "gust" of warm air. I have a room that gets really cold in the winter.  I have set it on low/medium because it got too hot in the room when I put it on a higher setting.  I have it on all night and the outside of the fan never gets hot.  There is one small spot where I can feel that it is slightly warm.  It turns off after about 10 seconds when it tips over.  It is like a typical heater in a house where it gets the room to a certain temperature (based on the setting you choose) and it will turn on and off to maintain that temperature.  It is slightly loud but not bothersome.  It does scare my cats though. It is a good deal for how cheap it was.

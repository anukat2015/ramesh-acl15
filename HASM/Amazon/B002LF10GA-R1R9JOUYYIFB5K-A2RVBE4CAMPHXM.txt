Title: Everything I expected
Content:
I relied on all the reviews when I shopped for this item and so I probably have little additional to add.  Battery life is impressive.  If you are used to a regular sized laptop it will amaze you.  I carry this unit in my briefcase as a travel computer and can go sometimes a week or two without firing it up and the battery is not discernibly drained at all.  I have not timed actual battery life in use, but I spent an entire afternoon with with my wife looking up real estate as I drove around and never became concerned about battery level.  Processor is slow by gee whiz standards in the market but there is no noticeable performance issue on everything I have run from HD video to every office application imaginable.  I am sure not a gaming computer, but for the size , utility, performance and price this is unbeatable for me.

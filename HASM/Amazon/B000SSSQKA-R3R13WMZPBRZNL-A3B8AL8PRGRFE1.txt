Title: Very Good
Content:
I just bought this vacuum 02 weeks ago and I'm happy with my purchase. It's a very light vacuum which was a must for me because I suffer with constant back pain. The power is pretty good too and the switch from hardwood to carpet make it easy for cleaning my area rugs. I do not think this would be a very good vacuum for only carpet floors, but that's just my opinion. My only complaint is the lack of an attachment for corners, I have to bend to get to corners or hard to reach spaces, but other than that is excellent!

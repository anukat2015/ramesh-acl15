Title: Fantastic Dual Coffee/Espresso Machine
Content:
This is a great product at a great price.  I dumped my previous coffee machine, a Cuisinart Grind & Brew, when the grinder started making an even more annoying sound than it used to.  Although the Mr. Coffee doesn't have a grinder, timer, or a thermal carafe (like my old Grind & Brew), its other options far outweigh those options.  I love how you can easily clean the water resevoir and how the coffee comes out perfect temperature.  Also, the espresso maker and milk frother are awesome. You just have to learn to put in more water than you'll want for espresso so that you have enough to fully heat/froth the milk.  This is a great machine w/super easy clean-up.  Can't beat it for the low price/free shipping at Amazon!

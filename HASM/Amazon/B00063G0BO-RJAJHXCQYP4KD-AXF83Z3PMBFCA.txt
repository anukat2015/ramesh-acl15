Title: Handy, cute, functional
Content:
I take this to the gym with me and it has everything I need:  MP3/OGG/WMA player for my own music, FM tuner for listening to one of the various TV monitors on the walls, compact & lightweight form factor.  The only thing I could wish for is a clip on the carrying case.  Very easy transferring music back and forth--just plug and play.  No additional software needed to install.  Haven't used the recorder capabilities and don't really see any personal use for it yet.  Very satisfied.

Title: Best Coffee Maker!
Content:
I love this coffee maker! It is so fast and easy to use. There is also a huge variety of k-cups to choose from. I have noticed you get more k-cups and cheaper prices if you buy them from Amazon. Yeah this coffee maker is more expensive then a drip coffee maker but you will save in the long run by not throwing out coffee, plus you will always have a hot fresh cup of coffee! I wish this model had a water filter built in but I use the Pur faucet water filter and that works great, alot cheaper then using bottled water and you get the same results. Go ahead and get one, you will be happy.

Title: NOT HAPPY
Content:
It looks good BUT trouble already. We purchased one [same brand] and it lasted less then three years. We though we would try again and so here we are. Out of the box,& about twenty min. to mount And the CLOCK will NOT keep time, off about one hour a day. Not too good.   H.E. in N.C.
